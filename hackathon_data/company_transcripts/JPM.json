We will open the floor to Q&A at the end of the presentation. During the Q&A session, a few things that will be important, because some of the people are in the room, please wait for the microphone, and say your name to make sure that the people on the phone know who is speaking.","Please be cognizant of others in terms of follow-ups, if you have several follow-ups we may have to come back to you towards the end. And then, we\u2019ll go to questions through the telephone, and last point we know that Wells Fargo is having their call at 10. We have set up a room, it\u2019s 207 on this floor, and a few breakout rooms for those who want to listen from here. With that, are we on in terms of the audio? Please take a look at the forward-looking statements, and I\u2019m going to turn it to Jamie.","Jamie Dimon","Sarah, thank you very much. I appreciate you all coming today. So, we have a whole bunch of presentation to take you through. And I\u2019ll start with me; I\u2019ll try to cover some of the high points. Unfortunately, I think you might have seen this morning that we announced a restatement of the first quarter. Doug will describe it in detail, and Mike, we don\u2019t take it lightly. We talk to our best advisors, accounting and legal and try to do what we thought was right, and the most conservative thing to do. Hopefully, this is what the SEC Chairwoman herself would have done, if she\u2019d seen all the same facts at the same time.","Today, I\u2019m going to cover, just give you a quick overview. I\u2019m going to talk about a whole bunch of significant items in the quarter, which we break out pretty right in the front of the press release, give you an update in the synthetic credit portfolio, talk a little bit about treasury and CIO, there are some questions about it, so we\u2019re going to try to answer some of those, our capital plans.","I\u2019m going to turn over to Doug, who is going to take you through, what we call the regular earnings presentation that has got a slide more of disclosures. And then Mike will give you an update in the CIO taskforce, it\u2019s kind of anatomy of the problem, all the good, the bad, the ugly of it. The review is continuing, I should point out. It\u2019s been guided by the Board, and if we find out more, if so possible, or more anything different or material, will let you know as appropriate. And we do find out more, we will do the right thing as we always try to do.","One thing which I would love people focus on a little bit at one point; it\u2019s to actually look at the businesses, the fixed businesses they have really good underlying performance. And that to me is why we\u2019re here, the main reason why we are here. We have significantly reduced the total synthetic credit risk and CIO, is down substantially. I\u2019m going to give you some real numbers and describe how we\u2019re going to manage that going forward, including the risk that is going on there.","Taking all of the remaining synthetic credit positions, transferring the IB, we put them there because IB has the people, the expertise, the capacity, the trading platform, the market franchise to effectively trade and manage these positions, and importantly they can do it within the historical bar and stress risk limit levels. This is what they do. This is going to let the rest of the firm go back to do what it should be doing.","We have closed down synthetic credit trading in CIO, we no longer be doing it. I\u2019m going to tell you one exception of one sure position we are keeping there. Our fortunes balance sheet remains completely intact; in fact I\u2019d call unbented. An extensive review has been conducted. Mike will take you through that, very importantly all of CIO management has changed. Matt Zames is here, while you may know him professionally, but he also brought in a lot of additional risk people, traders, financial officers to help manage the CIO area, and they\u2019ve been through top to bottom, all the governance, reporting, limits, et cetera in CIO. We do believe it is the best or I say the CIO, and Mike will talk about it little bit more.","These type of events are terrible, but there is one gratifying thing in them, as you find out that people come and bring their best everyday, we\u2019ve had hundreds of people kind of working around the clock now for three months to get this thing fixed, and wrestle down, and I think we\u2019ve mostly accomplished that. And that now we can focus our energy in what we do best, which is growing our businesses and serving our clients and communities around the world. Hopefully, after this is over, we will be a stronger company forward.","We did report net income of $5 billion for the second quarter, that would have been $4.6 billion, had not been the restatement. Earnings of $1.21, the first half over $9.9 billion that is not obviously unaffected by the restatements, and the balancing capital ratio is not affected either.","In the second quarter, let me take each one of these items little bit slowly. CIO trade and losses plus the synthetic credit book $4.4 billion, but in the first quarter it was about $1.6 billion not high in that, we\u2019re not doing that just basically in the first quarter, which we moved 600 by the restatement $4.4 billion this quarter.","Corporate CIO securities gains we\u2019d announced that actually when we told you the first time about this problem, we did not take additional securities gains. All I want to point out here is, these are always broken out in the P&L, so you can never hide them, and we take them generally for investment decisions. Do you want to own or not own that security? You don't generally take them to offset something like that, and I point out before, taking gains is generally tax inefficient, doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do it, which is generally tax inefficient.","Loan loss reserves came down by $2.1 billion, that\u2019s mostly in mortgage and credit card, and that's exactly the same conservative principles we\u2019ve used before. The good news is, charge-offs and delinquencies are coming down. And so, the reserves had to come down. In closing, we will give you a little bit more information on that.","The Investment Bank had $750 million of DVA gains, you all know we don\u2019t either consider that earnings. On corporate, we expect the full recovery in a Bear Stearns note. Some of you may remember when Maiden Lane was down, where the Fed took on $30 billion of Bear Stearns assets, we guaranteed the first billion dollar is a loss, okay?","Maiden Lane, they completely repaid the Federal Reserve. We\u2019ve now been paid $200 million. I think we\u2019ll get another $200 million sometime in a couple of weeks. We expect full recovery, the $1.2 billion plus interest and that\u2019s just right in the note backup to what we expect to get in cash plus interest in a little bit of time. I will go to the capital ratios here, and I\u2019ll talk about that a little bit later.","With the synthetic credit portfolio, the only thing I managed to, of the losses in synthetic credit, it is kind of costly. The worst part of this whole thing is when we started this thing, is that we knew we had these large liquid type of things to manage down, and we had $2 billion plus at the time. The way they figure is, we basically have been reducing the risk substantially. I\u2019m going to go through these numbers, but it\u2019s costly to do. It is costly to do. I\u2019ll give you these final ultimate risk, we did get it down. I think a little bit faster than you thought you might be able to.","Number one, we\u2019re transferring about \u2013 these are \u2013 I\u2019m going to give you rough true measures of risk here. I mean they\u2019re generally accurate, but this isn\u2019t a trading book, so we\u2019re not going to disclose specific positions. The risk-weighted asset transferred to IB, and this is a fairly decent measure of risk. It is about $30 billion, so their risk-weighted assets go up by $30 billion. It\u2019s down substantially from the peak, and it\u2019s about probably where it was on December 30, so one way up, one way down.","We significantly reduced net notionals and credit spread sensitivities. I will show you the credit spreads sensitivity at CS01 as how much you would gain or lose if the credit spreads widen by 1 basis point. You can see it\u2019s down from the peak of $51 billion to $7 billion; $7 billion is close to what I call a norm. We significantly reduced the On-the-Run and the Off-the-Run basis, this is part of what we all read about all the time about the IG9. The IG9 itself is down 70%. We\u2019ve reduced the basis risk between high yield and high grade risk in Europe and the United States. These are the kind of risks that got built up, complex risk that we \u2013 kind of which we didn\u2019t have when we realized it was there, it was down by 70%, and what remained did not, in my opinion not big a deal.","The residual portfolio that\u2019s transferred over to the IB is largely a delta-hedged tranche portfolio, it\u2019s stuff they know how to do, they\u2019re better at it than SEFO, but it\u2019s still large, we\u2019re not saying it\u2019s not large, it still could obviously move money or possibly make money.","Some of the positions are currently cheap to theoretical; it\u2019s not how they were when we inherit them, when Matt Zames joined us. I\u2019m giving one number here, extreme simulated scenarios indicate potential loss between $800 million and $1.7 billion. This portfolio can make money. The extreme simulated losses are things like a euro-zone crisis, a credit crunch, and the 99.9% statistical stress that had a loss about $1.4 billion. So, we do think it\u2019s a box, than I hope we don\u2019t have these losses at all.","To help us a little bit in the quarter, we will have about $900 million gain on swaps, we terminate against one of our swaps. So, we think we are pretty much done with the financial loss, if you can look at that gains.","I\u2019ve already mentioned that we transfer it to the IB and why; and they are more actively trading at than we were. If you look at the combined IB and synthetic credit portfolio risk within the IB historical, the RWA I mentioned look like $30 billion. It\u2019s not that significant to them. Therefore, I think it will be disclosed at the IB VaR, and the end of the month, the spot VaR was $74 million. The next day we transferred over, July 2 it went to $113 million, well within numbers we\u2019re used to and comfortable, we got as high as $200 million.","The remaining portfolio that we left at CIO is simple, so I mean, $11 billion short, basically for the liquid indexes, it\u2019s identified to offset some potential losses in a much larger AFS portfolio, the asymmetric one is mark-to-market and one is not. so we\u2019re not worried about this, but we\u2019re getting the one with far offset, there was no vice versa that we need to make separate decisions. You want to own those investments or not own those investments. we thought now as a rationale time to keep a hedge on certain credit exposure around the world, particularly with where you see going there, we\u2019re going with the euro zone. this hedge will come down over time and trying to keep it there necessarily ever, obviously we\u2019ll make those decisions as we see fit. It will show a VaR, remember there\u2019s a $11 billion, I have its own VaR, it\u2019s not hedged against anything, and is asymmetric, I have a huge VaR like 135 coming down over time, and then on its own it\u2019s about $34 billion of risk-weighted assets.","So next page, I\u2019ll talk about some treasury and CIO activities, I am going to go through this, first, I should point out treasury and CIO have been and always will be subordinated to the needs of the rest of the company. They can only invest when, where, how, why for the needs of the company and that involves how duration they invest in, and involve the credit they invest and it falls where they are investing around the world. So it is not a \u2013 that\u2019s a same portfolio, it\u2019s a logical portfolio. why do we have it all, we have $1.1 trillion in deposits, we\u2019ve got $700 million in loans. now that would generally be considered, fairly conservative. we\u2019d like making loans by the way.","So, between our acquisitions and in fact where money center bank we get a lot of deposits in, we end up with a lot of extra deposits. the extra deposits of $423 billion plus equity plus some of the net liabilities give us $522 billion is nothing lend out, but we have to invest. We actually split it in two pieces; some companies do it differently, some can buy treasury and CIO most have functions like this. The first piece is $199 million what we call treasury deployments. we\u2019re going to make a disclosure, it\u2019s on the balance sheet. It shows up its cash and do with banks and sometime it\u2019s government repo. Most of them is very short duration, most of it is central banks around the world. Some is in government repo. And we have it there, just for liquidity because we have a lot of money comes in and out of this company every single day. We\u2019ve banked number of nations, sovereign, savvy wealth firms, large companies, you could easily swing $5 billion, $10 billion, $20 billions a day.","Treasury and CIO has $323 billion, is down a little bit because we have been reinvesting in the last \u2013 giving Matt a little bit time to figure out what he has got for treasury reinvesting, but it has average rating of AA and an average life of 3.7 years. I am going to show you a little more detail on the next page.","First, transfer pricing, we take all the assets, all the liabilities, generated by the company, we\u2019ll take loans and deposits. We\u2019re constantly and dynamically evaluated for the risk pricing, their duration and liquidity, and we generally then pay units, market prices and what they did. So to pay market prices, they have the right kind of incentive to grow and not grow their balance sheet. They do not get gains \u2013 securities gains, or excess returns on CIO. They get kind of market rates or steady income. If you go back, I mean, years, you saw we had a lot of income at CIO, back then we told you that was going to get very high rates, we\u2019re getting passed on to businesses, it wasn\u2019t going to continue.","So, CIO invest to achieve the desired asset liability duration, which obviously changes all the time, all the companies worry about this. Now as you point out, our two biggest exposure credit and interest rates. And this is the place we kind of manage the most part the interest rate exposure. Currently, if you have to be duration neutral, like to the best of our ability to offset all interest rate exposure, we\u2019d have to invest in this portfolio and an average interest duration of 3.7 years. This invested currently, an interest duration of 1.2 years. That means that our balance sheet will re-price quicker, the assets will re-price quick in the liabilities, and that is disclosed and the disclosure may call earnings risk, that says if interest rates go up by 100 basis points, earnings will go up by $2.4 billion. That\u2019s how you generate that kind of a number. Obviously, you can change this over time and I will put this in the conservative category.","Obviously, the composition of our balance sheet will change over time, loans will go up. We need to meet the new LCR and Basel III requirements. CIO has reinvestment here of $40 billion. They have to invest every year probably if you want to estimate additional $20 billion or $30 billion of additional deposits. That flow will be invested in the things that we think have the most logic for the company in terms of liquid asset buffers, return of risk related assets et cetera; loans will be our priority by the way. This is not our priority. We want to grow our businesses, but we do have this minor invest.","Obviously, the more liquid asset buffers you buy you might reduce NII a little bit, but it also reduces RWA. And there is they are not the complete offset for this clause. And also over time, we\u2019re in pretty good chance to increase duration. Rates will go up again, your pricings go longer in the curve and earn back more NII. So, this is where we try to manage that all the time and do the right, still a conservative thing for the company.","Next page shows you the investments, I\u2019ve already mentioned the kind of the green line at the top, the treasury deployment and the cash and deposits in the banks, at mostly central banks, reverse repo, I told you, government securities that you have some very short term AFS securities. And then you can see below, how we break out this. I\u2019m not going to go through the detail here, if you want later on, you can call Investor Relations, get some more detail.","I just want to point two things, 80% of it is either government backed, U.S. government agency credit or better. The only other thing I want to point out is, every investment has risk. This concept is somehow you can buy treasuries, and think you might not lose money, you can buy credit, you might not lose money, you can buy mortgages, you might not lose money, any of them, you have to make a decision of where you want to put your company in this, and the future is always different.","So now that we have Basel III, you might know that the Basel III accumulates OCI, goes into your capital. So obviously, you have to invest being careful about how much capital you must bring around. So as time goes on, we will kind of re-launching this book a little bit. We still think it\u2019s fairly conservative.","On the capital planning side, the first column shows you net income that was just reported $4.96 billion. But \u2013 these are your analyst estimates now. So I\u2019m just taking your estimates for the company in the third quarter and fourth quarter, and you can see your estimates for the \u201913 and \u201914. I\u2019d somewhat point upright, we hope to be all of them \u2013 all those numbers I think, but we can\u2019t promise that, we hope to.","The next line down, RWA is our estimate. We\u2019re currently estimating Basel 2.5 with NPR et cetera in there, and we have run-off end model mitigation, whole bunch of things, that\u2019s our best estimates today. So if you look at the bottom line, our Tier I primarily goes from 7.9% today \u2013 there\u2019s no stock buyback, 8.5% the third quarter, 8.8% in the fourth quarter, 10.5% by the end of \u201913, 12% by the end of \u201914, i.e. we have a lot of capital generation. And that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s a logical thing to buyback stock. You could \u2013 buyback if you said, even my Board of Directors would say, how much stock you want to buyback. We can get to 9% Basel III by the end of 2013, and buy $23 billion, you can get to 9.5%, and buy $15 billion.","So clearly, we have the ability. What are we going to do? We would like to buyback stock, but after discussion with the Federal Reserve, we need to work with the Federal Reserve, the board has determined not to buyback stock until two things take place. Until we finish the Board review, I think it\u2019s a logical thing, so we come to the conclusion of the Board review, and we find no other major stuff, which I don\u2019t expect this time. And that we submit a new plan, capital plan as we\u2019ve said, only as to repurchase not as to dividends or dividend these type of things, and hopefully if this all goes well we can stop buying back stocks early in the fourth quarter.","The dividend will continue to be 30%. In the past, we\u2019ve said to you all, we hope to have a 30% pay out ratio, it is possible, you look at these numbers, strategically it might raise their ratio summing it down the road, but we\u2019ll decide that when we get there. And we\u2019re in a strong trajectory to meet the 9.5%. we have plenty of capital and plenty of capital generation.","In spite of this accident, this event has not changed or I think it\u2019s been a bedrock of JPMorgan Chase for the last five or six years. We believe in a fortress balance sheet, I\u2019ve given in a conservative balance sheet management. we always believe in high capital. for this whole crisis, you never saw our capital to go down. we believe in conservative funding, I won\u2019t go to the detail there, a lot of liquidity, here it says strong reserves, I would tell you, we believe generally in conservative accounting principles. we don\u2019t like to deceive ourselves with our earning money or not. And obviously this thing is also a little bit of an exception there. And I already mentioned at bottom, we have fairly conservative balance sheet management and asset liability management.","Our earnings, the real reason we\u2019re here is to grow our company. we think that with strong and diversified by business model, it\u2019s been a source of strength to this company, not a source of weakness, particularly in the storm. we have great earnings power, we still think the earnings power to adjust all kind of ins and outs about $24 billion a year.","We think we have some of the best franchise in our businesses, in the world almost every single one of them. They may not be the best, but I think they\u2019re damn close, and we think we have a very disciplined and detailed management team, sorry that we missed this thing, but we think where we want our business day-to-day, we have the pretty good businesses and management teams.","This slide, I\u2019d like to look at, because it just shows the build up over the last six years of our book value, on a tangible book value. I think our book value is clean with strong reserves, with strong accounting and good loans and all of good assets and things like that. And you could see throughout this whole crisis, it\u2019s never stopped growing.","So we were able to grow in difficult times, and I think it\u2019s a sign to strength, not a sign of weakness and it was driven by diversified businesses, constantly investing in the businesses, building what we consider market leading franchises and maintain our conservative principles.","So to wrap it up, we are not proud this moment, but we are proud of our company. We are not like making lightest error, but we do think it\u2019s an isolated event. One of which, you do hold capital is for known and unknown events, obviously, this one we shot ourselves in the foot, but that is one reason of capital for things I\u2019m surprised about. We learned a lot, I can tell you this has shaken our company to the core, and what happened here is that, most of the management team went back and said that we\u2019ve doubled our efforts to make sure, we\u2019re running a great company, granular, thoughtful, disciplined in every way possible.","We could never say that we won\u2019t make mistakes. We operate in a risk business. So we think \u2013 the slice of edge is not we\u2019ll make mistakes, hopefully it would be small and few and far between. We have a great franchise, but we have never stopped growing in this crisis serving our clients through tough times, and then we think we have great growth opportunities going forward.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug Braunstein, who will take you through the regular earnings presentation. Thank you.","Douglas L. Braunstein","Thanks, Jamie. So I\u2019m going to go through the earnings stats, so if you turn to that on page 1. Jamie really covered this page, just to highlight, $5 billion of net income, $1.21 per share. We did announced this morning that we\u2019re restating our first quarter earnings as Jamie said. The restatement is really based upon recent facts that we\u2019ve uncovered regarding the CIO traders\u2019 intent as they were marking the book. And as a result, we questioned the integrity of those trader marks.","We felt as a result of that, it was both prudent and a conservative approach to restate our first quarter. We\u2019ve also as a result of that determined we had a material weakness in CIO\u2019s internal controls over the valuation of the synthetic credit portfolio as of March 31. We believe however, we\u2019ve substantially remediated that weakness at the end of the second quarter. Mike is going to provide the details and how we uncovered trader intent.","From a financial point of view, let me give you four facts and then we are going to move on. The first is, the loss of the portfolio prior to the restatement for this quarter would have been $5.1 billion, after the move to $4.4 billion in total year-to-date $5.8 billion in losses. Second, we effectively moved $460 million after-tax to the synthetic credit portfolio from the second quarter into the first.","Third, year-to-date earnings $241 million unaffected by the restatement, restated earnings of $1.19 in the first quarter, $121 million in this quarter effectively a move of $0.12 approximately per quarter. And then the last, as Jamie said, year-to-date revenues, year-to-date net income, year-to-date capital, year-to-date balance sheet are not impacted by those statement.","So with that, let me turn you to page 2. And I want to focus on the $22.9 billion of revenue. If you excluded the significant items that impact revenue in the quarter, revenue has actually been $25 billion for the quarter. That revenue strength really came from some strong performance across a number of our client-facing businesses as Jamie talked about, let me highlight a couple of factors.","First is, we had positive loan growth, again. We\u2019ve added $40 billion in loans on an absolute basis in the last year, that after almost $23 billion of run off in our mortgage portfolio that we have told you, we have intended do and are doing every quarter.","We had record commercial bank loan balances this quarter, up 17%; business banking origination, up 14%; small business loans, up 35%; mortgage originations, up 29%; strong growth in AM, up 36% year-over-year; trade finance loans and TSS, up 28% year-over-year. So good underlying fundamental loan growth.","We\u2019ve also had some favorable franchise trends that continued. We continue to be the number one global IB fee provider this quarter; deposit balances in CBB, up 8% year-on-year; sales volume in card, up 12% year-on-year. So very good underlying fundamentals. Return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 15%.","If you turn to page 3, the Investment Bank, we\u2019ve circled net income of $1.9 billion for the second quarter that\u2019s on $6.8 billion. As we\u2019ve done in the last couple of quarters because we had significant item related to DVA, I\u2019m going to talk about it excluding the $750 million gain in DVA.","$6 billion in revenue for the quarter, $1.4 billion in net income, return on equity of 15%. IB fees were $1.2 billion this quarter, down 35% year-on-year, that largely reflects declining transaction volume and activity in the quarter, but as I said, and you see on appendix page 23, we maintained our number one share.","Market\u2019s revenue, $4.5 billion, down about 15% year-on-year, 30% quarter-on-quarter following what as you know was a very strong first quarter. Fixed income revenue of $3.5 billion, that largely reflected the weaker market conditions, but we did have strong client flows in the quarter.","Equity revenue of $1 billion that reflects cash volumes that were weak, we had very strong results at our equity derivatives business and prime services despite low spreads had a good quarter.","If you look at the expense number, it\u2019s down, but it\u2019s primarily driven by compensation expense. Comp-to-revenue ratio was 35% year-to-date, which is consistent with the guidance we had given you at the start of the year. And just to remind you as Jamie mentioned, Q3 will have the impact of the synthetic credit portfolio in VaR for the IB.","If you turn to page 5, Consumer & Business Banking, circled net income of $950 million, that\u2019s down about 14% year-on-year, flat essentially quarter-on-quarter. Net revenues of $4.3 billion, revenues primarily were impacted by Durbin on a year-over-year basis, but again there were some very favorable business trends. So I said, balances were up 8%. We believe that is significantly above the industry averages.","Business Banking originations were up 14%. Actually June, the month of June we had our highest production month in a number of years in Business Banking, and our loan pipeline of business banking today is at its highest point in history.","Client investment assets were up 5% in this business. We opened year-over-year 1 million more checking accounts, 2.5 million more active mobile customers, 45,000 new clients in CPC. So real strong underlying fundamental growth. Expenses continue to be impacted by all the investment spend we\u2019ve been doing, and I think as you look forward to overhead ratio in Q3, we are likely to return to the ratio we had in Q1, rather than this quarter.","Deposit margins were down this quarter six basis points. We continue to see that margin pressure. We talked about it for a number of quarters. That\u2019s a function of the lower reinvestment environment opportunities that we have. It\u2019s consistent with the $400 million in net income guidance that we said for the full-year related to this deposit margin pressure. But the aggregate NII was actually flat quarter-on-quarter and that really reflects the margin decrease being offset by deposit growth.","If you turn to page 6, mortgage production and servicing circled net income of $600 million, production revenues are three parts, production revenue of $1.6 billion, volumes of $44 billion, up almost 30% year-on-year, record retail originations, largely driven by refinancing activity including HARP. Margins are down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We expect them to continue to trend lower, it could be another 25 to 50 basis points really depending on the weight and refinancing environment.","We\u2019ll see repurchase losses in the quarter of $10 million. Settlements were $225 million in the quarter, and that\u2019s a function of reduced repurchase demands in mortgage, reduced pipeline of demands and an improvement in the repurchase rates that we experienced this quarter.","Based on this and our life time estimates for repurchases, which was $3.2 billion going into the quarter. We really believe we\u2019ve reached the inflection point that we had talked about and was inevitable over time. And as a result of that, we reduced our reserves or repurchases by about $215 million this quarter. And if these current trends and our estimates were projected, repurchases continue, we\u2019d expect the net repurchase number to be approximately zero for the next several quarters.","On the servicing side, we see pre-tax income of $65 million. It continues to reflect very high levels of servicing costs. We\u2019ve not seen the decline that we had expected in terms of default service expense for a number of reasons. But that was offset this quarter by some favorable MSR, risk management results.","If you turn to page 7, the real estate portfolio, net income of approximately $700 million for the quarter, revenues down 15% year-over year. It\u2019s in line with the estimates that we\u2019ve given you. It is a function of that run-off, the $23 billion year-over-year. Charge offs, circled number of about $700 million. The charge-off rate is down 28 basis points quarter-on-quarter.","Delinquencies continued to decline, and a result of that is, that we reduced our lost forecast going forward. We released $1.250 billion in reserves this quarter. I\u2019ll talk about that a little bit more in detail in a couple of pages. We\u2019re also reducing our guidance for net charge offs going forward to $750 million, little below on a quarterly basis.","Page 8, Card Services and Auto, consolidated net income of $1 billion for the quarter, that\u2019s down about 7% year-on-year it\u2019s on revenues of $4.5 billion in the quarter. we are continuing to see some positive underlying trends in this business. I said sales remained strong up 12% year-on-year.","Our new product sales for Freedom, Sapphire and Ink, sales volume up 20% year-on-year, and we continue to believe we\u2019re gaining market share in the card business. Auto originations up 7% year-on-year, and very strong merchant processing revenue growth up 13% year-on-year.","Credit costs for the quarter $730 million that reflects $750 million reserve release, that release incorporated a policy change for our Troubled Debt Restructured Loans, TDRs. and as a result of that, we moved forward our charge-offs on these loans from 120 days from 180 and that result in an acceleration of charge-offs of about $90 million in the quarter, no P&L impact, because we were fully reserved for those loans. But if you include that policy change, charge-off rate circled at the bottom is 4.32%, if you exclude it with a little over 4%, 4.03%.","delinquencies also in that circled number on the quarter 2.13% and we went back as far as 2003, this is the lowest rate we\u2019ve experienced in delinquencies during that period of time.","So with that, I do want to take a moment on the next page, page nine to talk about the credit trends. so we put here second quarter, first quarter and a year-ago, and then provided at the bottom trends around net charge-off. so we continue to see positive trends, charge-offs are down $216 million in mortgage, $550 million in card year-over-year. and those trends are demonstrated on the chart at the bottom, and delinquencies as I said are down.","The reserve actions that we took, as Jamie said, were effectively necessary to remain neutral given that improved credit environment and reduce the expectations that we have for losses. And if you look at the one number, I think it\u2019s particularly interesting, its loan loss reserves, the annual net charge-offs that\u2019s this quarter's charge-offs multiplied by four and those essentially stayed flat quarter-on-quarter even after the reserve releases.","So we think, we continue to be appropriately and conservatively reserved in these two portfolios and across all of our portfolios. But if the current trends continued, we would expect to see further reductions in the mortgage book reserves. And just remember a normalized credit employment, you would expect to see about 12-months of charge-offs, you can do the math and we are substantially in excess of that number today.","As it relates to Card, I think given where we are in the cycle you can expect reserve releases to be at or near an end. Commercial banking, we had net income of $670 million in the quarter that\u2019s on record revenues of $1.7 billion, that\u2019s driven by those record loan balances that I talked about, higher year-over-year deposits and that\u2019s marginally offset by the spread compression we\u2019ve experienced in our deposit-taking businesses.","Loan growth, we think continues to reflect both improvements in our customer base as well as real market share gains, so our C&I loan growth year-over-year is up 24%. We think that's almost double the industry rate. Record middle market loan balances, I think the ninth quarter, consecutive quarter of growth up 18% and while utilization still remained modest, we actually saw this quarter a modest uptick in utilization, so a little bit of additional activity. The credit environment in the commercial bank remains benign, excluding recoveries, net charge-offs in the quarter would have only been 13 basis points.","Treasury and Securities Services on Page 11, net income here of $460 million, that\u2019s up almost 40% year-on-year, 32% quarter-on-quarter. Revenues up 11% and very positive underlying trends, liability balances year-over-year of 15%. Assets under custody of 4%, international revenue increased 12% and expenses were only up 3% year-on-year as we start to benefit from some of the technology and expense initiatives that we have been talking about in previous quarters.","The result is fairly positive operating leverage for the quarter, pretax margins of 34% for TSS this quarter. But do remember, we get a little positive impact of seasonality in our WSS business from our ADR business. So we have stronger second and fourth quarters on the revenue side.","Asset Management on Page 12; circled net income of a little under $400 million, that\u2019s up slightly quarter-on-quarter and revenues $2.4 billion. Assets under management were effectively flat year-over-year, down quarter-on-quarter as a function of markets. We continue to actually see liquidity outflows this quarter in AM, but it was offset by our thirteenth consecutive quarter of long-term inflows in AM.","If you go to Page 13, Corporate and Private Equity, so we\u2019ve reported here as a result of the CIO activities of $1.8 billion in losses for the quarter, Jamie walked you through the specifics of the portfolio. What we\u2019re going to do going forward is report this as three distinct times, private equity, a Treasury CIO line time and then other corporate and we\u2019re going to try and give you a little bit of incremental updated guidance. So for Treasury CIO for the next quarter, you\u2019d expect to see us generate $200 million plus or minus in losses, and that\u2019s a function of the reinvestment opportunities and\/or need to redeploy at this point, but it will also depend on our reinvestment strategy so that and the number can vary quite materially, up or down an additional $200 million.","Other corporate, we expect to be a positive $100 million on average, but it can be very volatile, and that\u2019s even before significant items. So you saw that this quarter. So tax runs through here real estate, other small litigation can run through this line item, so there\u2019s a variety of items, but on average it should be about $100 million for the next several quarters.","On Page 14, you see what will be now contained in the supplement of our additional disclosure on CIO and on Treasury in a combined basis. So we\u2019ll have both the revenue and a net income line, I would draw your attention to the bottom right, which is Jamie talked about the VaR in the IB. At the end of the quarter the VaR in CIO was 180, for this hedge position, it is now 123, so again coming down over the last several weeks.","Page 15, fortress balance sheet, Jamie talked a little bit about our coverage ratios, but let me spend a moment more on the 7.9 that we reported for the quarter just to clarify. That is reported with the full impact of Basel III both the new 2.5 rules as well as the published NPR as if it were adopted. That however is our best estimate at this point in time and obviously, things can change, as we continue to refine and work with the regulators on the application of those rules. If you actually look on a comparable basis to how we recorded our second quarter, our Basel III ratio was up modestly.","We also in the appendix, I\u2019m not going to go through it, we added a walk for you on both Basel I and Basel III, so on Basel I, if you add the impact of 2.5 rules to Basel I, it would reduce our Basel I recorded ratio by 160 basis points. If you took the NPR as a return, it would add an additional reduction of 100 basis points. So we are obviously with the industry in discussions with the regulators around the interpretations of that NPR.","We are going to continue to report Basel I as is until the first quarter of 2013 when the new rules take effect. The last thing I just remind you on this page actually put it on, we are going to keep this on now, as you\u2019d think about returns on balance sheet given the different business mix, we internally look at returns on RWA relative to our competitors, and sort of set different balance sheets on a comparable basis, since RWA has only reported reliably on a Basel I basis. We are doing that comparison and you see we had a positive 1.6% return on our risk-weighted assets for the quarter comparable to the first quarter, and you think we\u2019ll compare very favorably to our peer group for the quarter.","Outlook on Page 16, I\u2019ve covered most of the items here, but I really want to cover two in specific. The first is incorporate private equity, Jamie mentioned it as a result of the TruPS redemption, we are going to book in the third quarter about $900 million in gain associated with swap terminations that were related to the TruPS that we are redeeming. In addition to that, you see the net income impact NIE impact from that redemption that assumes no refinancing obviously that number would change depending on how much incremental financing we do against those redemptions.","The second is an update on expense. And if you look to the bottom right on firm-wide guidance. We expect our adjusted expense number for the second half of the year to be flat with the first half of the year, and if you compare that to what we said at Investor Day that would be up somewhere in the order of the $1.5 billion to $2 billion relative to that guidance.","There's really two reasons for it, about three quarters of that difference is associated with mortgage, and that gets broken down half-and-half. Half of the increase in expense and mortgage is associated with incremental revenue and production, so it's good expense and it's made good profits, but we didn't anticipate that at the time of Investor Day. The other half is associated with those high elevated costs in servicing related really to the consent order, the IFR and a variety of other matters.","We expected that to come down sooner it has not, but you should think about this as timing as opposed to absolute difference in expense, it will come down over time as we work through these issues. About a quarter of the expense is associated with the environment we\u2019re in, which is we've had higher legal, higher compliance, higher FDIC and that we had anticipated and that has run through a variety of the businesses.","Page 17, the final sort of piece of the corporate in terms of items. We've added this Core NIM page as you know, couple of quarters ago, a Core NIM declined by 10 basis points this quarter, for some who\u2019s going to, I think you\u2019d give another topics, no one is going to jump right in with the NIM question first half, so I figure, I give you the answer now.","NIM is down 10 basis points really on the lower rate environment, the mix change in our loan portfolio. And the important impact this quarter was actually accounting from FAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness. That was really the primary driver both in our investment securities yield portfolio as well as in our long-term debt portfolio. And if you just focused on the security sales that were associated with $1 billion of gains that actually did not have a material impact on the portfolio for the quarter.","Last comment is really on page 18, which is our European disclosure. As it relates to the periphery, $6.3 billion of total exposure rather at the end of June. That\u2019s down from $12.5 billion at the end of March, and what I want to caution everyone is a significant portion of that is really a function of hedging activity on that exposure, which we may or may not do on a go-forward basis.","And the net exposure, I think, you should expect to return to the levels more consistent with where we were at the end of the first quarter. We do continue to be active with our clients in the region, but we are clearly being more cautious given the environment today and focused really on helping those clients do business in the markets.","So with that, I\u2019m going to stop, turn it over to Mike. And then, after Mike we\u2019ll be back for questions. Thanks.","Michael J. Cavanagh","","Thanks, Doug. So I hope everybody\u2019s coffees kicked in and mine as well. We\u2019re going to spend a little while here going through the Task Force Update. So, for those on the phone or on the web, if you go to the next section as what it\u2019s called. So in the room here, I\u2019ll dive right in on slide number one, which describes the management review that\u2019s been underway for the past two months. So my job has been to lead this firm wide response and conduct a rigorous review of the events leading up to the losses, assess what went wrong, and mobilize the company to make necessary fixes happen, and while some work remains. I am glad to say that the scope and intensity of what we\u2019ve already done or ask me to give you today, what I think is a very clear picture of what happened and what we\u2019ve done about it.","I have to say that it\u2019s been an incredible effort by many people and I just to thank everyone who has been involved in getting this work done, to get it here. So now what I am going to is go through this presentation in three sections. First, we\u2019re going to spend a bunch of time just walk you through some facts. Then we will go through observation and implications of those facts. And then finally, I\u2019ll bring it to close with the remediation actions that we\u2019ve taken in response to all of this.","So if you start, let\u2019s begin on slide two and that is just a summary of the key findings of the review. So there are five key observations, the first is the actual cause of the losses, and the other observations are things that had we\u2019ve done them better, may have reduced the size of the losses allowing us to detect issues earlier.","So the first one, which is the cause is that, CIO judgment, execution and escalation were poor in the first quarter. Second, the level of scrutiny of CIO did not evolve, commensurate with it\u2019s increased complexity. Third, a dedicated risk management team supporting CIO was ineffective in dealing with the challenges of this portfolio. Fourth, risk limits in CIO were not granular enough. And fifth, that\u2019s the model, the approval and implementation of a synthetic credit VaR model that we talked about, it happened in the quarter was poorly done. So with that overview of these observations, now let\u2019s slowly go through the pertinent fact that these support.","So on slide 3, some of the historical contexts on synthetic credit portfolio itself. So the portfolio\u2019s primary purpose had been to provide a partial offset for losses we would suffer elsewhere in CIO and the company in a stress credit environment. The portfolio got started about five years ago, it was generally short credit, but also included some long positions in order to reduce the cost of carrying credit protections, and consistent with it\u2019s objective, the portfolio produced gains in a stress period of 2008 to 2010, and was break-even or positive each year from 2007 to 2011. And all in, it generated about $2 billion in gains during that period.","So next, on slide 4. Now we get in to a summary of the first quarter 2012 transformation of the portfolio that led to the losses. In late 2011, CIO was directed to reduce the synthetic credit portfolios risk and risk-weighted assets, that direction came as part of the annual budgeting process in which we developed the firm\u2019s capital plan, including our glide path to Basel III.","Now the second bullet, I will attempt to explain what it appears the synthetic credit team and CIO hopes to do. And that was to move their portfolios risk position from a net sure position to a neutral one, while reducing risk-weighted assets in the process. They also hoped to retain some protections against corporate credit defaults, which was the synthetic credit portfolios historical mission.","So again there are a lot of things going on that they were trying to accomplish and found it difficult to find a balance that they liked. To simplify what they did, it amounted to them going long investment grade indices, while increasing short positions in junior tranches and high yield indices. And the size of the portfolio grew dramatically, as they continue to add positions later in the quarter when they were struggling to balance the portfolio as the market began to move against them.","So the question why they didn\u2019t just pursue an outright reduction of the portfolio, and it appears and that\u2019s all as an appearance that they thought about it a bit, but they believe that it will be more expensive than the approach they chose, which obviously proved to be wrong. and then we\u2019re focused on thinking about high execution cost to reduce the portfolio in size and to lock carryover reduced portfolio. and so they went ahead with the approach they had.","That\u2019s my best shot at describing what it seems they were trying to do, and now you move to the third bullet, where you see what we now know, which is what they did do with increased size and complexity of the portfolio dramatically in the first quarter and along with the sensitivity to a variety of risks, which you can see listed there all of which contributed in some parts of the losses and Jamie touched on some of these earlier on.","On the slide five, I just gave a graphic representation of basically the same thing, which is the growth of the portfolio in the first quarter. on the left, you see the total notional size of the portfolio with the red dots being the net of long and short notionals, which as you can see tripled in the first quarter.","Now you can\u2019t look at this slide and fully understand the risk of the portfolio. but what it does show is that the significantly increased size and complexity of the portfolio left little margin for error when you expect the pricing relationships across the portfolio began to break down and generate losses. It was a very risky approach they took that should have been discussed, embedded at more senior levels, but it was not.","So now for the next three slides, what I\u2019m going to do is layout some key events that happened during three sequential time periods. So the first one, slide six, covers the first period and that is from the beginning of 2012, to late March 23, by which point the cake was fully baked on this thing. And since we all have loss making positions, we\u2019re already on the books.","So during this period, what you see on this slide is three key events I want to talk about. So the first one, was that certain CIO level risk limits got exceeded and how those exceptions were handled. So these types of business level limits are common across the company, and when they are exceeded, the independent business unit risk managers are responsible for reviewing the reasons for the excess and either granting relief or ensuring that action is taken to get back inside the limits.","Specifically two CIO level credit spread widening limits were exceeded over the course of the quarter. In January, a measurement of the impact of credit spread widening that ignored correlations across instruments, exceeded its limits, this was reviewed by CIO\u2019s market risk officer who granted relief from the limits, on a basis that the measure was an unsophisticated tool for measuring risk in these circumstances.","And then secondly, the other one, there was on March 23, the second CIO level of credit spread widening limit was exceeded and this was obviously of little use as a control measure, since it occurred after the positions were already put on.","Now, the second event you see on the slide here in the middle bullet was the approval of a new synthetic credit VaR model in late January. This was approved by the independent model review group in corporate risk management.","The week before the new model was implemented John Hogan, the new Chief Risk Officer and Jamie were asked to sign-off an temporary increase of firm wide VaR in an e-mail, which noted that CIO VaR model was soon to be approved which is expected to lower VaR and they assented and went ahead with that approval. But the problem with the second event here, which is why I saw in the slide relates to the model approval itself.","Again, this was done by the model review group, despite reasons are concerned about the weak operational environment supporting the model, which we\u2019ll come back to you later on.","And then the third event on this slide was the February 29, CIO business review with folks from the corporate and there will be CIO attendees at that meeting indicative that the portfolio, the synthetic credit portfolio was well-positioned and RWA reduction was on track and raised no other issues. So that\u2019s it for the key events up to the period of March 23 and that is the period by which all the positions were substantially on the books that led to the losses and the portfolio transforms.","So now let\u2019s go on to slide seven and move on to the next time period. I just wanted to talk about and this is the period from then, March 23 then to the April 13 earnings call. So first the portfolio experienced losses in late March and early April. Around this time, market visibility of the synthetic credit positions becomes a concern particularly after press reports on April 6. At that point, Doug and Jamie ask for a review of the portfolio and preparations for the earnings release a few days later.","Ina spearheaded the review with engagement by John Hogan, Doug Braunstein and others. The main output of that review was forward scenario analysis that produced the probable P&L range for the second quarter on the portfolio from positive $350 million to negative $250 million with the bias \tto the positive end. So at that time, the group got comfortable as the portfolios risk was manageable, that in need of heightened attention going forward and assurances to that affect were provided to Jamie and Doug.","Now, let me just make a few additional points about this review. First, that analysis was led by Ina, which made sense. She was very capable of driving review of an activity in her area of responsibility. If there was a question about something like this in TSS for example, I\u2019d fully expect and to leave the charge on bottoming it out as would other operating committee members for their businesses.","And the second point is that, Ina inturn relied on the managers and traders responsible for the portfolio, and to knew it fast, she produced the supporting analysis that stage over those few days, and hindsight obviously, their views may have been unduly influenced by their conviction of the market\u2019s awareness of their positions was causing aberrations in pricing that would reverse.","I\u2019ll also just say here that the VaR model is not a focus during the pre-earnings released review because there were no indication of that fit, that wasn\u2019t working properly, it\u2019s a backward looking indicator and actual losses had already prompted demands for the forward-looking scenario analysis that was being done. And so on April 13, this period ends and we will announce our first quarter results.","Now moving on to slide eight, this is a set of facts for the period between the earnings release and the launch of the management review. So in late April losses pick up and the heightened monitoring that\u2019s followed the earnings call, it\u2019s taken to another level when the senior team from corporate risk is send to examine the portfolio from the bottom-up.","So they begin providing daily updates and construct an independent analysis of the portfolio that becomes the basis for risk measurement that the new CIO team picks up a few weeks later. It\u2019s during this period that problems with the new VaR model are discovered. We use the old model for the VaR number in the 10-Q and disclosed that we induced the new model on April 13. This event has caused us to tighten up our procedures around model changes and disclosures going forward by the way.","We filed the first quarter 10-Q on Thursday May 10 and held the investor call that evening with an update on synthetic credit portfolio and finally, on Monday May 14, Matt Zames has announced as the new CIO and our management review is launched.","So that\u2019s it for the facts on slide nine. We transition from those facts, which you do see summarized on the left to the observations they support on the right, which is what I covered at the beginning. And now let\u2019s spend a little time going through each one of those observations in a bit more detail.","So on slide 10 is the first one, which is the observation that CIO judgment, execution, and escalation were poor. So first the trading approach itself was poorly conceived, reviewed and executed. As we saw in the facts, the portfolio grew to a parallel size with numerous embedded risks that the team did not understand and were not equipped to manage.","The second bullet on the page is about insularity. Even within CIO, the discussion of the portfolios stayed in the chain of managers with direct responsibility to us. A robust review among peer leaders and CIO would have provided for a discussion and challenge on the business side, which is what I\u2019m accustomed to seeing across the management teams in this company and it didn\u2019t happen here. And this was again compounded by the failure to surface issues related to the synthetic credit portfolio in the February business review with corporate.","And then finally, the CIO led review and analysis of the portfolio in advance of the April 13 earnings call was poorly managed, resulting in the view that potential losses were manageable, that the portfolio was balanced and would recover. So now before I \u2013 leaving each of these findings, I\u2019m just going to comment quickly on the remediation actions that relate to it, that we\u2019ll get to later and prove this one, those fixes are the people changes that have been made and all the relevant CIO roles and a complete revamping of the management processes in CIO.","So the second observation is that the level of scrutiny that CIO faced did not evolve as the complexity of the synthetic credit portfolio increased. So some of the contributing factors here was the belief and experience that the core activities of CIO were managed appropriately, contributing the unit successful track record. Second was the capability of an experience of Ina herself and third, was the modest but positive results of the synthetic credit portfolio historically. So as a result, we collectively ended up with a level of scrutiny that fell short of the high standards. We apply to our client businesses especially as the complexity increased.","Moving on to slide 12, the third observation is that CIO risk management was ineffective in its responsibilities for the synthetic credit portfolio. Now I\u2019d acknowledge some factors that presented challenges for the CIO risk management team including what in hindsight was the lack of quality resources and a less robust risk committee supporting the risk team.","Nonetheless, the CIO risk team failed to meet reasonable expectations in my mind. First, a primary responsibility of the business level risk team is establishing adequate risk limits. In this case, higher or more appropriate limits would have forced more discussion and debate about this portfolio and if needed would have prompted escalation to more senior levels. And fairness to the CIO risk team had an effort underway to improve the risk limit structure for CIO, but it was too late to matter.","Second, CIO risk team did not perform adequately when it came to the VaR model approval and implementation, and I\u2019ll cover that in a couple of slides. Third, CIO risk wasn\u2019t forceful enough in challenging the front office and they never developed the sufficient understanding of the risk of the portfolio to escalate concerns the senior risk leaders outside CIO during the first quarter. So now to remediate this, we\u2019ve added new people in key roles. We\u2019ve also significantly strengthened the risk committee framework that covers CIO and other corporate sector activities.","So on slide 13, observations, number four, that risk limits in CIO were not sufficiently granular. So this is a critical one and we saw it in the facts on slide six that we gave ourselves too few opportunities to engage risk or other senior people as would have been the case if we had a well designed limit structure around this portfolio.","First, there were no risk limits specific to this synthetic credit portfolio. So limits apply to more aggregated portfolios often at the level of CIO, which was clearly inadequate. Obviously though what was needed was granular position level limits for the portfolio itself.","And I\u2019d just say that in our investment bank credit derivatives business, the limits are already very granular. I believe that had the synthetic credit portfolio been risk managed under equivalent standards, it would not have experienced the unchecked transformation and growth that led to the losses. As for remediation here, we now have granular risk limits for all CIO and verified they\u2019re in place and where needed across the firm.","Moving to slide 14, is the final observation, is that the synthetic credit VaR model approval and implementation were inadequate. So there\u2019s been some speculation here that this model was approved abruptly and by CIO alone, but that\u2019s not true. The fact is that CIO began working in consultation with the independent model review group in corporate risk in mid-2011 to upgrade the VaR model used for synthetic credits to a more accurate model that captured correlation risk as required for Basel 2.5 compliance, which we did not have with the old model and we obviously wanted to get.","The expectation of all parties involved in the model approval was that the new model with lower measured VaR on the basis of the improvement and the calculation methodology, together with the infrequent band brakes of the old model would suggest that it produced conservative calculation of VaR.","So our fundamental problem with the VaR process was the lack of clarity on the roles and responsibilities for each element of the process across the model review group, the CIO risk group and the CIO front office. And the primary problem in the end though was sloppiness and bad execution in implementing the new model, operational problems, which included incorrect data feeds and certain calculation mistakes resulted in a VaR that was lower than what the approved model would have produced.","A properly implemented model would still have a lower VaR compared to the old model, but not by as much. So it would still have taken its bit of time to catch the overall problems, but as we\u2019ve said, it probably delayed us a little bit. So to remediate here, we\u2019ve strengthened the procedures around significant model approval and implementations.","So slide 15, another transition here. So now we have just finished up reviewing the observations on the left side of the slide, and now I\u2019ll touch in a little more detail on a couple of major remediation actions that foreshadowed a bit.","So on slide 16, moving to that, first, we have what is effectively a complete revamping of the CIO unit itself. On the people front that includes new CIO management team members including Matt himself, plus the Head of CIO Europe, the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. All of them are very highly regarded and have substantial experience at our company.","In terms of governance, the new team has instituted a robust committee structure, new review processes and better reporting, which will provide for better discussion and debate to ensure mistakes like this one that occurred here don\u2019t happen again. And in terms of CIO\u2019s mandate, Matt is refocusing on the core mission of managing the AFS investment portfolio. The synthetic credit activity has been shutdown, and the liquidate portfolio transferred to the Investment Bank, where it will be better managed.","On slide 17, you see a summary of the risk management remediation actions, both for CIO and the firm. For CIO, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we have a new Chief Risk Officer, and have added resources to support his efforts. This new CIO will have responsibility for all the areas, the corporate sector not just CIO. As we learned from this event, all activities outside our client businesses need robust risk management coverage and by broadening the mandate of this new Chief Risk Officer we\u2019ve accomplished that.","Next is risk governance. As I\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve created a much more robust risk committee for all activities in Corporate that is modeled after the committees in our client businesses; it includes significant representation by senior executives and subject matter experts from outside CIO. The committee has already met numerous times and it\u2019s completed detailed reviews of the activities of CIO ensuring risk parameters are consistent with the newly refocused mandate.","And as for risk limits, we\u2019ve introduced proper limits on all other CIO activities across the rest of the firm, we thoroughly reviewed the market risk limit structures to see if we lacked granularity elsewhere, and found them to be in good shape. And finally, we\u2019ve bolstered the policies for dealing with risk limit accessions by requiring higher levels of escalation and more frequent reviews.","Slide 18 summarizes the remediation of the model approval and implementation and monitoring processes. So here, we\u2019ve clarified the roles and responsibilities between the firm-wide model review group and the line of business risk management functions for the model review group, which sits in corporate in addition to reviewing and approving the VaR calculation framework, which is their core activity.","The group must also assess now the quality of the analytical testing and the soundness of the model operating environment whoever it is that\u2019s responsible for that. We've also formed up a new team inside model review that will monitor model related responsibilities across the risk management function firm-wide. they've been underway and they've already reviewed all market risk VaR models and confirmed that data integrity in operating environments of sound.","And then for the lines of business, we\u2019ve clarified the responsibilities across all aspects of model governance including post-implementation monitoring and we\u2019ve hidden the expectations for model oversight through the line of business risk committees.","So finally, on remediation, I\u2019d just say that, I just reviewed the remediations that are the ones that directly address the observations from the management review of CIO. but I should add that we\u2019ve picked up a lot of other learnings along the way during this work, and they were acting on those things as well to make the company better.","So now, just to wrap it up. on slide 19, I\u2019ll wrap it up by saying that based on everything, the team and I have examined and reviewed in the past two months, I believe that the synthetic credit event is an isolated failure that's both because the circumstances in CIO were unique. but also because of the thorough shakedown of the whole company that we did to be certain that we weren\u2019t making similar mistakes elsewhere.","I\u2019d say, in closing that our management team has always been and continues to be very highly focused on managing risk and this event has caused us to step up our game everywhere.","So thanks for listening to this. we\u2019re going move to Q&A now, and while Jamie and Doug rejoined for that. I\u2019m just going to get us started with a couple of topics that is here to get Q&A going. so to just pick up where we \u2013 Doug already covered a lot on the restatements, I just want to link it back to the work that I\u2019ve done.","so this slide, here is some supporting information on the restatement that Doug covered earlier, all of these numbers are the ones that are in there. So the context is, it\u2019s really the management review efforts that\u2019s created the highly unusual circumstances we are faced with in making the decision to restate the first quarter.","Remember, we started the management review on May 14, which was a couple of days after we \u2013 all the works supporting the 10-Q filing on May 10 was completed, but as I\u2019ve described the management review facts finding has been very exhaustive. We\u2019ve done, obviously lots of e-mails being reviewed, but also tens of thousands of voice tapes, many of them in foreign languages. and so it\u2019s taking time to work our way through and work continues.","But a broadest of determination in the past few days that as Doug said, we don\u2019t have sufficient comfort that for the first quarter the trade remarks met the requirements of being where the traders thought they could exit their positions. I\u2019ll just point out though that\u2019s even though the marks were generally within the bid ask spread, which is what otherwise is accepted for a gap. So given the unusual circumstances, we\u2019ve taken the conservative approach to restate bringing the marks to the VCG estimates of external mid-market benchmarks.","Next, I just want to say a few things on the people side. so first, on clawbacks. So employee related actions for CIO managers here on slide 22. And now, Jamie is going to talk about Ina in a minute. I\u2019ll talk about several other managers, all the mangers in London with direct responsibility for synthetic credit portfolio are now separated from the firm. None are receiving severance and no 2012 incentive compensation. We\u2019ve made the decision to clawback compensation from each of these individuals and that amount is the maximum permitted, we\u2019ve invoked that.","It represents approximately two years of total annual compensation for each individual covering stock and options. We took into account or we\u2019re taking into account a broad set of factors. I\u2019ll just make the point that the balance of factors for any individual in this bounces differently, but all ended up at the same result of a full clawback. The Board\u2019s reviewed all of these decisions.","I\u2019ll just say further because there maybe questions on people actions, what current here is the three London managers, with direct responsibility for synthetic credit. But there is several other changes in senior people and CIOs, some of whom have been reassigned to more appropriate roles, and others who will be leaving the firm. We believe we\u2019re taking all the appropriate people actions in a timely manner. But beyond what I\u2019ve said, I told you here we\u2019re not going to be providing more details on people actions and obviously not going to be talking about individuals.","And then finally on 23, I\u2019ve got a Board statement to read on compensation determinations and forget the three people I just covered and as I said, Jamie will cover Ina. Advancing the slide here. For all other individuals, and that includes Jamie, that 2012 performance year compensation and clawback, if appropriate will be determined in the ordinary course considering among other things, the factors you see listed, which is company, unit, and individual performance on absolute and relative basis. The achievement of non-financial objectives, which of course of the same things, we would always consider in a total picture on compensation, of course involvement and then responsibility for the CIO matter will be included in that. And just an added point, we\u2019re only going to make public information about what we do on clawbacks if it\u2019s required.","Now let me hand it over to Jamie, who wants to make comment about Ina, and then we\u2019ll go to Q&A.","Jamie Dimon","Thanks Mike. So let me say a word about Ina Drew. I have enormous respect for Ina as a professional and as a person she has made some incredible contribution to this company. But she has decided to retire, I got several letters from former chairman, who talked about her contribution, one even said she saved the company, in his judgment. From my experience she has acted with integrity and tried to do what was right for the company at all times and (inaudible) part of those mistake, and I believe that\u2019s true here as well. In that spirit, Ina came forward in order to give up a very significant amount of her past compensation, which is equivalent to the maximum clawback amount.","So with that let\u2019s turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd","","Glenn Schorr from Nomura. Thank you very much. That doesn\u2019t count as a question, right? So in the past couple of Investor Days you\u2019ve shown us some slide on the earning power of the firm being in the range of $24 billion, pretty buyback over the cycle earnings. Curious on post this CIO related changes, how you think about that. I do appreciate that you\u2019ve showed us $2 billion over the last four years in the credit portfolio earnings. Is that it? Is that how we should think about it?","Jamie Dimon","","Yeah, this just not affect the earnings part of the company at all. So the $24 billion still be accurate and probably show those numbers, we didn\u2019t [firm] up there. We could probably show you the numbers, almost the same as showed you last time, there were lot of guys, where we\u2019re today minus the burden and mortgage.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd","Okay. So no other big changes to the investment philosophy in CIO. Okay. Good, thanks. On the European exposure side that you have in one of the slides, I guess I\u2019m looking for a net confidence or net takeaway. Has the situation in Europe gone any better because that hasn\u2019t from a lot of people\u2019s view and then maybe your level of confidence around your exposures, hedges and what you\u2019re doing behind the scenes to potentially prepare for the potential [denominations]?","Jamie Dimon","","So we think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent. We think, we kind of have the rollercoaster ride here. And you see progress in a two steps forward, one step back. We still think, we\u2019re going to model through that may not be in the former fashion or the time table roll to prefer. The numbers up there, we went from $12 billion to $6 billion of net exposure. We think that\u2019s a rather good number, and the stress test, we think our risk goes and we talked about a potential loss of $3 billion in a bad scenario. It could be worse and a complete extreme scenario like pulling apart the whole European Union. The important thing, we\u2019ve continue to conduct business there. We have a lot of clients in Italy, Spain for 100 years or so, and we are doing that carefully. And obviously, we\u2019ve been doing more hedging of the exposures there and that decision we make periodically over time.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd","Okay, last one. Maybe I don\u2019t know if there is a point of clarification because I think everyone appreciates the full run-through and disclosure on the CIO. But coming into today, I was saying well, it would be great if they kick, I mean, what the loss was, what they think the expected loss is, and what percent is gone or left. You\u2019ve got us on the loss side. You\u2019ve got us on the full run-through. But I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m clear on what\u2019s left, how much of it\u2019s gone or how much it\u2019s still with you? Thanks a lot.","Jamie Dimon","We showed a lot of numbers, so the risk itself was down two-thirds, 70%, 80%. So it depend on how you measure it through IV, it doesn't have to lose money at all. And it\u2019s at the extreme stress scenarios, simulated stress scenarios, which we \u2013 in a euro crises, a credit crunch, a 99.9% statistical analysis, could be as high as $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion. That\u2019s one thing we expected and I\u2019d be surprised we\u2019ve got that through.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Matt O'Connor.","Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank. I\u2019m going to ask the same question, Glenn started off, just as we think about longer-term earnings power, I mean, how can we completely ignore those some profit from the macro hedges, there should be some de-risk in the securities book? So I kind of want to ask the same question again and trying to get some number on that.","Jamie Dimon","There was $2 billion of profit in this book over a four, five year period. We didn\u2019t assume any of it going forward at all, so it's not like we take a lot of risk in extremely big projects, we were not. So it was not in our numbers, it doesn't change the $24 billion or anything like that. We met de-risking the AFS portfolio it's about \u2013 and we\u2019re still investing about $350 billion at a 2.6% yield, and you can go by Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae, and say it\u2019s 3.25. So you could easily extend duration with very short duration, extend duration, earn more NII. I think the portfolio is actually conservative will be a source of higher earnings, if \u2013 in one ways go up. So this will not affect the earnings power of the company at all.","Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","And as we think about the core businesses and specifically the Investment Bank, I mean you\u2019ve talked about looking through rechecking all the risks, bringing down some limits potentially. Will we see any of that impact going forward?","Jamie Dimon","The Investment Bank is doing what they\u2019re supposed to do. We\u2019ll not ask to take them any other risks, because it took some synthetic credit. They are going to manage synthetic credit, it\u2019s just what they do, but the rest of the business is running exactly where it was before. And they constantly manage their own risk exposures.","Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","And then separately, I don't know if this is \u2013 if you can say, I think specific to judge more again or just overall, but LIBOR obviously has been in the news quite a bit. If there is anything that you can say or even when will we know what we don't know instead of time-to-time or\u2026","Jamie Dimon","All I can say is like all of these things, there are a lot of people doing exams, we\u2019ll be open total openings regulators and investigators. And the other thing I\u2019d be a little patient if I were you and not every thing is the same, it\u2019s going to take a while and not all companies are in the same position.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Betsy Graseck.","Jamie Dimon","And we couldn\u2019t make too many assumptions at this point.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley. So two questions, one on capital, you indicated that you think you\u2019ve got a strong trajectory to 9.5%, we're getting two numbers from starting point there, either it\u2019s the starting point of 9.1 plus litigation or 7.9, which one are you referring to?","Jamie Dimon","Yes, it was 7.9 as we\u2019re still facing everything upfront.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","All right.","Jamie Dimon","What we say with the nine as you actually fully fade the runner-up stuff and some of the models that we\u2019re going to do. We would get another 1.9 within the next two years. So I\u2019m just trying to show apples-to-apples.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So 9.5 that you\u2019re saying is on trajectory too is by what timeframe?","Jamie Dimon","That 9.5 is the end of 2013 and it was like 10.5 or something at 2014. We don\u2019t buyback stocks like 10.5 and 12.5. So right that slide, you could see it, that\u2019s what our stock buyback. Well, that\u2019s not taking \u2013 it\u2019s only taking advantage of mitigating items that we knew would actually happen.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And then separately, a little bit of a follow-up on the LIBOR question. So one of the concerns that people have had is that clearly with large London presence and with what had happened in the CIO, there\u2019s a question around controls in that region. and so it gets to people thinking about the CIO office didn't have the controls in that part of the world. why should we believe that the rest of your organizations did? and so I think that\u2019s what\u2019s on people mind is there, hearing today the CIO trade, mailbox been wrapped up, but looking forward next six months having our stock in the commons up in some other area?","Jamie Dimon","Well, I can never prove in negative, okay. and so Mike just went through the \u2013 our expenses controls and disciplines, which we feel pretty good about, he can\u2019t prove to you that because you\u2019re not going to see it. We think this is isolated. And we think the control is in your \u2013 or just as Mike referring to the controls around the country, around the world. We think that it\u2019s pretty good.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Nancy Bush.","Nancy A. Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC","Yes, Nancy Bush, NA Research. Jamie, two questions for you. Your underlying trends were very positive this quarter and there just seems to be a disconnect between what you\u2019re seeing in your underlying trends and what were you hearing about the economy, which seems to be softening, everybody is gloomy, things are terrible, et cetera, et cetera. Could you just flush that out a little bit?","Jamie Dimon","You\u2019re making a good point, because Doug showed the numbers like eight quarters of continuous middle market loan growth, but anecdotally, he was at the other companies too, not all other banks, but a lot of the banks, I hear a lot of the banks small business loan growth, the fact is, we underpin the American economy on their back. Corporate America, middle market companies, small business are okay, there were a lot of equity, it\u2019s not a huge order book, so sales aren\u2019t going to max. We had slow to modest growth. We started to see it in our calculations, some of we\u2019re getting these market share gains. So remember we did middle market, we weren\u2019t doing middle market banking in California, now we do. We weren\u2019t doing small business in California, now we do because of we\u2019re [Wal-Mart] position. So we are gaining severance of our businesses through credit card, middle market, small business, IB\u2019s holding share.","Nancy A. Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC","Second question, there is not a lot of discussion about litigation reserves and your commentary today, could you just comment broadly about with the CIO matter was upcoming whatever may happen with LIBOR, et cetera. What you guys think about your litigation reserves at this point?","Jamie Dimon","So I think, financially, we spoke about mortgage, we think it\u2019s kind of well. We\u2019ve really done a good job there and it could change over time. We put away a lot of way to mortgage over time. This quarter when you see the 10-Q, as you get to see the 10-Q, it will show litigation expenses like $300 million. So we try to keep up with reserving for things we know about. This quarter, of course we had some digging the [nets] isn\u2019t might just one thing that happens.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Richard Ramsden","Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah, Jamie, can you just take us through what the process is for reapplication for the buyback, do you have to resubmit a full CCAR. Are the assumptions going to be the same as what they were for the first one? And what are reasonable timetable for that\u2019s going to be?","Jamie Dimon","Little bit of deviation leading and weaker too.","Douglas L. Braunstein","","Yes.","Jamie Dimon","And we\u2019re getting our structures about what that process is going to \u2013 might be, what kind of project, but whatever it is, we think we can accommodate it and get it done and resubmit it. And like said I hope that both the board governance, the board estimates review, so I can\u2019t tell you when the board is going to end this review, but I am hopeful that the board review and the capital plan are done in such a way that by the early in the fourth quarter we just buyback stock that we won.","Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. And with the stock trading has this changed your waterfall in terms of buyback versus dividend, dividend increase next year versus buyback?","Jamie Dimon","I wrote letters that \u2013 in terms of book value, I think our stock is a great buy.","Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Ed Najarian.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","","Richard\u2019s question was my question, so you\u2019ve got it. Thank you.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Andrew Marquardt.","Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Thanks. Just on the GIPS exposure again, you\u2019ve previously talked about max losses, if all things \u2013 of $3 billion after-tax is that still valid, or is there a new number?","Jamie Dimon","","The $3 billion was my estimate after-tax, it was $5 billion pre-tax. I did it with my own methodologies, I said it was not, it was a bad outcome, it\u2019s not the worst outcome. As you said that Europe unravels the euro falls apart, I think it could be worse than that. Yeah, I\u2019ve been just recently \u2013 I\u2019ve been just constantly looking into this not for company, so TSS does it their number recently is more than $3 billion. We have a Europe command center, we have got a lot of \u2013 we know exactly what we are doing there, if some thing goes wrong, we try deal with it. We don\u2019t have the necessary of losses at all. The issue with Europe and the complex is with Europe or what contracts apply, how they apply, who leaves the euro, what currency you paid in, whether that do for losses in the country. So there are all these complex things, but those numbers would still being rough estimates so they are bad outcome, but not the worst outcome.","Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","Thank you. And then separately in terms of that your outlook slide is \u2013 something that wasn\u2019t there was the real estate portfolio, still coming down 10% to 15% you\u2019ve said in the past $500 million drag NII on a year-over-year basis, that\u2019s still valid for this year, and maybe somewhere around next year, is that an ongoing issue?","Jamie Dimon","Say, you could assume at this phase same change, same assumptions. Thank you.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Mike Mayo","Mike Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Mike had a statement saying the level of scrutiny did not evolve commensurate with the increased complexity. He was referring to CIO, but I wonder if that statement could apply to the firm as a whole. I mean February 28, we were all here eight hours of presentation, over 200 slides, no mention of CIO, and then we have the CIO event a risk model that didn\u2019t capture the risk, a new risk model that wasn\u2019t accurately tested before. Checks and balances that might have been passed with the investment bank, it seems to be a little solid. So I\u2019m wondering if the firm as a whole, it\u2019s reaching sort of tipping point when it comes to bigness or complexity that makes it more difficult to manage than in the past?","","Jamie Dimon","No","Mike Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Okay. What can you say to further reassure us, I mean, you\u2019re here in person, have you lost your step, has the focus has gone off\u2026","Jamie Dimon","We have \u2013 Mike, this company is the same company that went through \u201806, \u201807, \u201808, \u201809, 2010, 2011 assimilated Bear Stearns brought one of those. And we have record in the last year, we have the record in the year before, it\u2019s likely if you look at your own estimates were record in this year. Okay, and that we have got gained market share, investment banking as a nice management our commercial bank and small business in middle markets, we\u2019re just have great job in marketing the , we\u2019re going to sit back and trying to make this more attractive companies for you all. We\u2019ve made a mistake, we completely disclosed mistake. The newer results are in front of you, we\u2019re in better shape than a year before. Our CIO was not a place, we expect no mistake, we make a mistake. I can't prove it negative. I cannot prove a negative. We believe we\u2019ve had very good controls and very good people in place.","Mike Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","And you\u2019ve gotten the results\u2026","Jamie Dimon","Look at the results by the way.","Mike Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Yeah. I know the results are, if we didn\u2019t have the details here it would be okay. But we saw how to sausage is made and it just make me more if I might get through poising sometime in the future. What would you say, if you talk to a portfolio manager and you have, 20 seconds to say what weren\u2019t happen again, what would you say to that portfolio manager?","Jamie Dimon","Because we have very granular limits and we\u2019ve got risk committees, credit committees, audit committees, we do terribly a very good job. Now I think it\u2019s certainly for anyone in the business world to think you\u2019re not going to make mistakes. It is not possible in the real world, that\u2019s only possible to fictional world, I just think the mistakes should be small and fewer far between, this has been an exception.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Chris Whalen.","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","Chris Whalen from Tangent Capital Partners. First, just quickly on the CIO. Does the nature of these instruments is over-the-counter instruments make you read consider whether or not all of the controls and risk management, everything else you\u2019re putting in place can be effective?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah, it\u2019s not been nation\u2019s instruments. A lot of these things are traded on exchanges, most of the index that you can go and buy from a marketplace easily; most of them are in clearing houses and if you \u2013 so want to see you can see them. So I think this portfolio became very big and very complex.","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","Right.","Jamie Dimon","I mean that is true, should never, ever, ever going to begin that complex. And meantime the first they\u2019ve said it was too big, it was on embedded, it shouldn\u2019t been done, it was a liquid, it was bad. We should have quoted earlier\u2026","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","Right, but that\u2019s kind of my point. When you have an instrument it doesn\u2019t have a clear basis and the basis may ship, the correlations may ship very quickly, can you manage that risk?","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019m sure for all financial instruments.","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","Right, now three quick regulatory questions. On Basel, to what extent does the Volcker rule implementation limit your ability to manage the ASF portfolio?","Jamie Dimon","Not at all.","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","Okay.","Jamie Dimon","The AFS portfolio is held for sale.","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","Right.","Jamie Dimon","So its mark-to-market and the equity count that\u2019s not mark-to-market. And we think you should do you allow the portfolio hedge, we\u2019re not going to do some like this again, but we think (inaudible) and so we\u2019ll talk about Europe one of the quick ways you want to go hedge Europe, right now, you get on the phone, you could buy a $1 billion deduction on European \u2013 a 120 European credit names. That is a good thing if you want to protect sales from Europe. It\u2019s not that complex.","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","Right.","Jamie Dimon","So it also changes in the future for whole bunch of things, we\u2019ll adopt to that whatever that is.","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","On Basel III, how do you expect the Basel III implementation affect your mortgage business?","Michael J. Cavanagh","On a Basel III basis, it\u2019s not material, that the real issue is the NPR on Basel I and that\u2019s a work in progress. But all the numbers that you see there and the projections that we have just, I assume continued growth in the mortgage business. So we will get some benefit that run-off portfolio is going to liberate a substantial amount of Basel III capital, and as a result \u2013 RWA as a result free up some capital, but\u2026","Jamie Dimon","As a business matter, we\u2019ll explain whatever the Basel III numbers are, it is still a complex. It does create all these things about mezzanine pieces, how securitization is going to work. What\u2019s the FICO score, like FICO to 660 would be very bad under Basel III. So, everyone to modify the business trends of Basel III. It won\u2019t change the mortgage, our ability to be in the mortgage business.","Christopher Whalen \u2013 Tangent Capital Partners","And last question, how do you feel about the extension of the FDIC Transaction Account Guarantee Program?","Douglas L. Braunstein","I\u2019m not sure whatever you\u2019re talking about.","Unidentified Company Representative","(Inaudible)","Douglas L. Braunstein","I\u2019m not going to comment on that.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Moshe Orenbuch?","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey, thanks. Doug had mentioned about the material weakness related to the CIO office. The comments about resubmission of the CCAR and the timeframe into the early fourth quarter, does that contemplate resolving all of kind of the regulatory increase that are on going in addition to the Board, and do you anticipate orders coming out of that? How should we think about the news flow from that standpoint?","Douglas L. Braunstein","","And we\u2019re hopeful that when Board finishes review the regulators get to look at everything when Mike is said and done, ask your questions, filed a CCAR. We\u2019re hopeful that by the first quarter we will buyback stock. We think the number is justify. We think the performance of the company justifies it, but we want to go through that process. It\u2019s a prudent thing to do and some stops that were happening and so there.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you very much.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Brennan Hawken?","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","I\u2019m Brennan Hawken, UBS. So just, and I appreciate that maybe you guys didn\u2019t include some of the synthetic gains in your estimates of earnings power, but you might help if we\u2019re, when we\u2019re looking at these past CIO gains and net income, if we can know how much of that was attributed to the synthetic? So you got 2 billion bucks over \u201807 to \u201811, crucial portion of that\u2019s in 92 from \u201809 to \u2018011. Can we have an [idea], was most of that $2 billion there in the \u201809 to \u201811, can you give us an idea there?","Unidentified Company Representative","I don\u2019t\u2026","Douglas L. Braunstein","","So the figure was about $1.4 billion of the $2 billion was in \u201808 to \u201810.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Was that pretax?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Pretax.","Unidentified Company Representative","It\u2019s pretax. So those numbers are pretax over there.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay. So that\u2019s helpful. All right, great. And then, do you know if, with the CCAR resubmission of this, is the scenario going to change? Or is it going to be the same?","Michael J. Cavanagh","","They are refreshing and updating their scenarios. We\u2019re going to want new scenario pursuant to their guidelines.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And in the discussions, I would assume Jamie your confidence that 4Q be get started, that is reflective of what you\u2019ve heard back from the Fed as well?","Jamie Dimon","","We\u2019re essentially hopeful and I\u2019ve been wrong before.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Fair enough. And then, my last one. I don\u2019t know if you can comment on this, but it would be helpful to know, do you guys have specific controls that separate communications between derivative traders and the LIBOR rate submission employees?","Michael J. Cavanagh","","We are not going to comment anything right there right now.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Thanks.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Ed Najarian?","Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah. I\u2019ve question for Doug. You talked about some of the net interest margin pressure coming from hedging effectiveness. Could you quantify of the 10 basis points, how much you think that is and do you expect that to revert in the third quarter? And then, just generally, given the really impressively low interest rate environment improving right now, maybe some sense of your view on that net interest income trajectory of the company.","Douglas L. Braunstein","So on the first, it was several basis points of the impact. It\u2019s going to vary quarter-on-quarter. It has varied quarter-on-quarter. So part of the difference this quarter is, we had some positive results last quarter and negative results and swing is less important from NIM standpoint. On the NII, in aggregate, we have some portfolio run-offs and we\u2019ve provided you some guidance around that. We continue to build our balances and build our loan portfolio. So the question is going to be which exceeds the other here.","","Jamie Dimon","And one disclosure you are going to see, is that this AFS portfolio is yielding 2.6%, but this quarter is going to be\u2026","","Douglas L. Braunstein","2.407%.","Jamie Dimon","2.407%. That is hedging effectiveness. It\u2019s really still yielding 2.6%. We did something like that, just a few hedge ineffectiveness when it goes against the asset.","Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group","And then as a quick follow-up, you talked about potentially getting, being close to zero in terms of mortgage repurchase costs through obviously the income statement over the next several quarters. Can you give us maybe a little more commentary around that, are you seeing a significant decline in claims starting to come in? And then secondarily, can you make any comments in terms of your sense of what\u2019s going on in the private label side of mortgage repurchases either on in terms of claims or with respect to litigation?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Yeah. so the real differential there has been a modest decline. The real differential is our secure rates because as these demands go deeper into the securities, they are taking more mortgages that we\u2019ve been paying for longer and the result of that is that we\u2019ve been decreasing the amount of demands we actually have to repurchase. That\u2019s really been driving in part the analysis. On the private label side, you\u2019ll see in our supplement, we had a modest increase in demands, but much of that is going to make its way through litigation.","Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group","So your statement about zero really excludes any thoughts about that litigation?","Douglas L. Braunstein","","That\u2019s separate. Separate in the stakes","Edward Najarian \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, thanks.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Chris Kotowski?","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","","Yes, also for Doug. I wonder if you could walk us through a little bit on the changes in the Basel III ratio. At the end of March you reported 8.4% versus 7.9%. Obviously, the NPR must have had an impact there and I was wondering if you could break down what the bigger chunk of that impact are, is it for the treatment of home equity loans or\u2026?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Sure. Actually 20 basis points was refinement of our earnings as a function of the restatements. So there was some move for the restatement, actually about a 10 basis points. The remaining 30 basis points, you can think about that principally as the CRM minimum that was added to the Basel 2.5 rules. That\u2019s the bulk of the RWA. It\u2019s an increase of about $40 billion from our portfolio. We would estimate because that is subject to model approval and you need at least 12 months of operation model approval from the first quarter of 2013. So we are hopeful that $40 billion comes back into when it\u2019s included in some of those projections that Jamie showed you, comes back as a reduction. So we were pretty close on our Basel III estimates.","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay. Now the way I read it though, like, in the home equity loans in particular, it looked like for over 80% loan to values that you\u2019re going to have 1.5 times capital charge?","Douglas L. Braunstein","","That\u2019s Basel I.","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay.","Douglas L. Braunstein","","That\u2019s Basel I. Basel III rules getting really changed very much for the mortgage portfolio.","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Sarah M. Youngwood","(Inaudible)","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you. I understand from your information that one of the reasons for the losses here was that perhaps the successes even led to some complacency, real governance of the unit. And as I look through some of the discovery information, it seems that the risk management profile here was one that excluded certain basic tenants of risk management, granular levels of asset, concentration risk et cetera. So I guess, I think, as a question was this [year bill] conceives from our risk management perspective, from day one and it took five years to reach the end result or there are perhaps some small successive [look perhaps] the credit management over time that ultimately and perhaps we can look at the new VaR models, and in that being one of those that ultimately led to this result.","Douglas L. Braunstein","So I would say it\u2019s something that the complexity of synthetic credit was there over five years and there were things that obviously we could have cut sooner, but it didn\u2019t took the circumstances in the first quarter get us, but the overall mistake was allowing something that wasn\u2019t like the rest of the ALM type of activities to get housed inside CIO that have one form of risk management structure and then put something new in that required whole different type of risk wrapped around it and do it at the time.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Todd Hagerman?","Todd Hagerman \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","","Yes. Good morning, Mike and Jamie. Mike, you talked a lot about the VaR models, some of the changes. Jamie, you\u2019ve talked in the past about your feelings one way or the other in terms of the usefulness of VaR, if you will, and what I\u2019m curious about is with all the discussion on VaR, if you will, what changes have been made in terms of the dependence on the model themselves and how that relates back to the risk management and the model group and what other controls, tools you may have put in place to again make this a more robust process if you will?","Jamie Dimon","","Yeah, first of all, I don\u2019t go in a business on models. And if you do go business on models you will be dead. It doesn\u2019t work. VaR is one model. We use tons of other models and I think Mike pointed about the right way to do is have let other granular limits, notional amount limits, credit spread limits, single name limits, all these things. VaR is just one. VaR does not capture underlying changes and underline. So it captures changes in correlations. It\u2019s only backward looking. So it\u2019s a data point that helps you manage your business. That\u2019s all it is. Now having said that, Mike, we got to do a better job implementing some of these models. Mike?","Michael J. Cavanagh","","It is a process of brand models, not the models themselves that\u2019s defining there and the granular risk associate too big takeaways. If you look at the findings there, I\u2019d say, get the right limits around the activity one, and that\u2019s not necessarily a VaR model or any one given type of activity, but if we are going to put things and we got help suspend just to make sure we have proved for the right reasons and as the right operations put around it.","Todd Hagerman \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","","So just as a follow-up, it\u2019s my understanding as an example with the CCAR process and the review of the trading operations, specifically a lot of dependence was placed on the models in terms of their review. What are you sensing now in terms of given the event that\u2019s transpired, how that evaluation is going to change on a go-forward basis, particularly as we think about next year\u2019s CCAR process in light of this event?","Douglas L. Braunstein","I think we certainly put a lot of attention on ourselves. And I think the takeaways that we saw was just bolstering all processes around model of governance, implementation approval, a new team which took 25-year veteran risk manager in charge of a new groups. It\u2019s really going to lead up watching model activities all parts of the process, because really the mistake we made here was roles and responsibilities.","So whereas I would say we\u2019re very good, and particularly our Investment Bank, which is the heaviest user of models. We\u2019ve got very robust in-business market risk teams that have the hand off. We\u2019re dealing with parallel testing, back testing, running the operational model themselves. CIO was weaker in that regard. So when you have the interaction between the independent model of review group and the market risk teams in the business, again a particular mistake here. So that's a policy in procedure thing that we\u2019ve even tightened up and John Hogan\u2019s done a lot in the past month.","Unidentified Company Representative","CCAR is not VaR dependent. It\u2019s stress testing. We do and I would say stress testing is more important, most of the stuff. We do extensive stress testing. And so, to me, you got to get that right. So CCAR has embedded as one test. We do hundreds of stress tests, and obviously we should have done stress testing in this particular portfolio better too.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Paul Miller.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, thanks. Jamie, I think the [10-year] today is right around 15. We keep on hoping as banking analysts that it keeps on going up, but every quarter it goes down. But the 10 year, the flat year curve, which is starting to really weigh on a lot of peoples\u2019 net interest margins, net interest margin was down like 13 basis points, 14 basis points. It really feels like this 10-year is not going to move, and moving a little bit of flat yield curve longer than anybody wish, maybe in the 2014 and 2015. How does you as the bank position yourself for that environment even if it goes down though a lot of people thinking at 1% at this point?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah. So I\u2019m not actually going down to 1%, but getting near the end of the margin compression from the yield curve. So I think if I move across about a year or two ago we might lose another $400 million or $500 million and then it flattens out. And then 10 goes down more, it\u2019s even more. We are short. Most banks have much longer duration than we do. So we could easily, today, put on change what we are doing and put on $50 billion in a mortgage of 3% and earn a lot more. So if you believe in that we could change our structure to earn back some of that income, in fact far more than what you might loose.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","I guess if we take a bigger step back, as we\u2019re going to be living with this flat yield curve, banks like to live with a steep yield curve. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve all been raised on the last three or four decades. But if we\u2019re going to live in this environment, I mean, how does banks operator? I mean, how are you positioning your institution to go forward with a continued flat yield curve? Yeah, you can adjust the balance sheet. That\u2019s a one-time issue, but going forward how would you run this institution?","Jamie Dimon","I was just telling, I don\u2019t think the effective yield curve has gotten away. If it stays like this forever, we\u2019re still going to earn about what we are earning. So it isn\u2019t like, you have to deal with the negative every year, after the year. And then, obviously how you do your loans and your deposits and get a lot of things in your balance sheet, which earns very little to you, almost doing the service for clients, you might do less of that. So instead of $200 billion of treasury assets we have, we\u2019re earning five basic points on that. So we don\u2019t need to keep those deposits, but we may modify that, but you\u2019ll change your pricing, your products, your services and try to earn a fair return on capital.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Gerard Cassidy.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets. Doug, you touched on the LCR ratio in the Basel III. Do you guys have an estimate on where that is today, the liquidity ratio?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Yeah. So basically, if you get the number today, it might show a gap, but that gap is easy for us to fix by just changing your asset mix. So we will be LCR compliance by reinvesting the AFS portfolio. We are doing there slight different things. But we want to see the rules before we start swinging the balance sheets all over the place. We will be fine. We are very liquid company.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And following up on the yield curve commentary that you just made, Jamie, are the returns acceptable, I mean, as you pointed out there is not any incremental negative impact for you guys at the yield curve stays as right. Are the returns on equity acceptable or would you try some on those strategy possibly shrinking the balance sheet and buying back even more stock?","Jamie Dimon","We asked that question all the time, but we\u2019re actually believing making good returns right now. If you look at the returns in our businesses, the 15% return of tangible equity, the record earnings, so could we do more? But we like to tilt the business, bankers, services, clients, execution of services, to grow our business over time and we\u2019ve been doing that such that we focused on, and then we modify pricing products of balance sheet to get a fair return.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And then finally maybe your comments on what you\u2019re seeing in Europe, how they\u2019re progressing on solving those problems. Do you want to add any color to that?","Douglas L. Braunstein","It\u2019s very hard to answer the way you read about everyday. Now we\u2019re reading about what they kind of need to do and they need to do kind of all of them, one is the bank have the European bank regulator, European bank scheme to stop bank loans have some facility that could finance the time and spend of sovereign debt in the meantime, and then fiscal union, the people believe it. And we think you guys see that kind of in fits and starts over time, and just people compare it to a rollercoaster.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Hang on\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, Jamie.","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","Unidentified Analyst","On as assets in 76, as liabilities. Two questions, can you tell us how much of those are netted for the same counterparty? And second, how much of those numbers was the CIO numbers in that at the end of that quarter?","Jamie Dimon","We\u2019ll do the second one first. I think it\u2019s a very small, but CIO is a very small for that number.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. I would agree.","Jamie Dimon","And that\u2019s number one. Number two, they are very complex in any rule, which I don't want to go to here about derivatives, but we did do a presentation.

Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC","Hi, Nancy Bush again. Mike a question for you. Looking at your slide number eight, the events in late April, you say Senior Corporate Risk Management team began onsite bottom-up engagement on April 27, had a senior risk management team done an onsite bottom-up engagement in the CIO before and is that now sort of a established part of risk management.","Michael J. Cavanagh","It\u2019s a good question Nancy. What we refer to there is a \u2013 in late April, at this stage, which John Hogan over there and team folks from outside CIO and for cross business, when into \u2013 to really sit onsite and take the book apart. Prior to that there was obviously work being done with senior risk folks, but we\u2019re looking through the lens of the CIO risk team. So it took to a different level of intrusion.","Jamie Dimon","And the CIO risk team did an inadequate job.","Nancy A. Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC","Okay.","Sarah M. Youngwood","(Inaudible)","Unidentified Analyst","One quick tweak of the and share has always been the incentive structure. I\u2019m just wondering if in the CIO review there was any conclusions based on \u2013 if incentives were aligned with long-term shareholder interest.","Jamie Dimon","","Sure, we\u2019ve obviously looked at all that. None of the people in CIO are on in any form of formulas to business is not on a formula. We obviously looked at compensation for what we were doing in CIO relative to what you would see \u2013 pay related to running $350 billion fixed income portfolio. I can\u2019t obviously get in the minds of the individuals that \u2013 in making individual decisions, but we\u2019ve looked for evidence of particular things that were problematic around our compensation schemes and then found no particular issues.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Matt Burnell.","Matt H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. A couple of quick questions for you Doug. First of all, you mentioned that the net interest margin effect of the AFS gain or the securities that were sold to generate the gains, this quarter had no effect on this quarter\u2019s NIM. Does that imply any of future quarters NIM as well?","Douglas L. Braunstein","No.","Matt H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Depending on the sales were down.","Douglas L. Braunstein","No, no.","Matt H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay.","Douglas L. Braunstein","More a function of reinvestment.","Matt H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Fair enough, okay. And then in terms of the investment banking in sales and trading results those appear to be even if you strip out the DVA reasonably strong. Could you give us a sense as to what your outlook is for those numbers to the extent that you can guess it, and what the drag from Europe is on that, on your outlook there for the next quarter or two?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Yeah, first of all as you know investment banking revenues are unparticular by the nature. And whenever they come in with a low number, I would say we\u2019re pretty much higher. So right now, it looks similar to what it was last quarter. That can change at any one point in time. Obviously, I think you see everywhere, the business in Asia and Europe were down, the America remains to be same.","Matt H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","And then one final question. given all the information that Mike provided to us, how much of that information or will there be more information, not only provided to the regulators, but some of your friends on Capital Health?","Douglas L. Braunstein","","So we share a lot of information that people ask, the radar is a completely up-to-date on Mike\u2019s information. Mike, get into this...","Michael J. Cavanagh","Yeah, absolutely. More than absolutely.","Sarah M. Youngwood","(Inaudible)","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. I'm (inaudible). Maybe from the perspective of the buy side, a long suffering shareholder and my clients, I\u2019d like to follow-up on Mike Mayo\u2019s question and also reference to KBW report that looked at the potential of splitting off the Chase Consumer Bank with RON credit and having a standalone JPMorgan Commercial bank, investment bank trust and TSS.","and the point being much as the tipping point or actual diseconomies of scale, and even if there are economies of scale, the stock market refuses to acknowledge it in terms of the multiple continuum to come down. And I look at the track record over the past year, so and notwithstanding a great performance relative to a pretty low VaR. but it's still a good performance. But we've had the mortgage servicing issues, mortgage foreclosure issues, and military veteran issues, energy, commodities, sales practices, now that\u2019s inexcusable, just unbelievable CIO debacle, and our potential LIBOR. And I think about, what has to happen for either you as a management team or you as a board to finally say, we are a great institution and we own a lot of great businesses, but we have reached that point where we are too big to manage, and in the interest of our shareholders there\u2019s a different corporate structure that would better serve your owners. Thank you.","Douglas L. Braunstein","Yeah, just I like to differ, okay, and there is huge strength in this company that the units get from each other. So, we don't have the strategy, or we\u2019re guessing the things. The investment banks sort of the commercial bank, the TSS gives huge order flows investment bank, we think there is a numerous amount of cross-sell and we do just as much as most, anybody else have there between the consumer banks, small business, private wealth management, credit card mortgage. And our job is to do a great job serving clients grow the business and eventually the stock will reflect it.","And so, I think also people, they\u2019re spitting off company. I\u2019ll give my whole life that gives us (inaudible) higher P, lower P that\u2019s like, that\u2019s very short-term stuff. Have a strategy, execute on it, built a business that's where you build value. We don't feel great to be, it haven\u2019t been a great job for sure all this recently, that we completely acknowledge and but we keep on building the company and one day the stock will reflect it. If the Board ever thought of a better strategies, that will be considered at the time.","Jamie Dimon","Right, I would respectively say that, yeah certainly the cross-sell is very obvious, and that's why we\u2019re not look at separating into numerous companies, but I'm just wondering at what point it does become more apparent that there are diseconomies and is it potential that, is it possible to have CIO in part of a smaller institution, it would have gotten the management look that it required.","Unidentified Analyst","Hundreds of small banks have gone bankrupt okay (inaudible) went bankrupt?","Douglas L. Braunstein","","I'm not telling you those\u2026","Jamie Dimon","You could have argued the other way, there is a huge source of strength that helps growing this company, do all these norms and do best during the involvement, do all these wonderful things, CIO was a mistake, and we\u2019re sorry.","Sarah M. Youngwood","(Inaudible)","","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, two very quick follow-ups. One I just want to make sure on the LIBOR issue. I understand all the things that you can\u2019t talk about mid investigation, but I\u2019m assuming this has been gone on for a while that you\u2019ve had three, six, maybe more months of internal investigations. Is there anything you can tell us and comment on?","Jamie Dimon","No.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, one last try, okay, Doug, on the commentary\u2026","Douglas L. Braunstein","Oh, no.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, Mike, on the expense commentary, second half and first half just technical question, does that exclude the $3 billion or so of litigation reserve build in the first half or is it all inclusive?","Michael J. Cavanagh","","We talked about the adjusted expenses excludes that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks.","Sarah M. Youngwood","I think we had a question from John McDonald.","John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","I actually had two and Glenn just stolen both. But I guess just one more slide that\u2019s on the LIBOR, do you have any sense of how long the issue will overhang on the industry and whether we\u2019ll get some kind of clarity about the investigations over the summer or is it something that could drag on for long time? Any insight in that and when we\u2019re going to get more information on it?","Jamie Dimon","We had no special insight again.","John E. McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, thanks.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Richard Ramsden?","Richard Ramsden \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just a quick follow-up either for Jamie or Mike, was the process of valuing positioned in the CIO book different to the investment bank? Was it just the application of the evaluation technique? I\u2019m referring specifically to the Q1 restatement? Thanks.","Jamie Dimon","","This is the application of policies are the same across businesses different applications.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Ed Najarian.","Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Hi, Jamie, quick follow-up on sort of your perspective on capital, so since Investor Day in February, it seems like the world has gotten a little bit of \u2013 to be a scarier place in terms of \u2013 we\u2019re more concerned about Europe, we have the LIBOR thing has cropped up, we're talking more about global economic slowdown. I know you mentioned, you love to buyback the stock at one times tangible book, but is there anything about the last several months of events just from a macro standpoint that make you want to drive to higher capital ratios or get to 9.5% on Basel III Tier 1 common equity faster than you might have thought you wanted to back in February?","Jamie Dimon","","Yeah, there \u2013 a little bit, and you know those things are as Europe, the fiscal cliff in the United States, it\u2019s all those things will make you to be a little more cautious, but again, I think we\u2019re \u2013 next year regardless of all the things and whatever happens.","Sarah M. Youngwood","","Gerard Cassidy.","","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Mike, you give us a very thorough detailed disclosure how you attack this problem with the CIO, and you are very confident that you have your arms around it. Do the regulators have that same confidence, have they shared that with you that they feel very good that you guys sort of look at this problem?","Michael J. Cavanagh","I can't speak for the regulators, but certainly they have been \u2013 we\u2019ve spend a lot of time with them to keep them informed and obviously wanted to guide our work apart from the get going away that was going to satisfy a lot of different opportunities.","Douglas L. Braunstein","","They're going to do their own work as they show it, it comes to own conclusions. Remember, the board as an independent group, which is still guiding this taskforce and it will come to its own conclusions too.","Sarah M. Youngwood","Brennan Hawken.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Mike, when you went through your review, do you think that may be the idea that there was no formula for comp in the CIO might have led to some of the trouble and the stretching? And then on a go-forward basis as the follow-up, which is probably more important, how are you guys thinking about structuring comp in the CIO office over the next few years.","Michael J. Cavanagh","","No, I mean I don\u2019t think. When we talk about formulas, the individuals getting a cut off revenue, none of that existed, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing. I think the kind of practices that are common in CIO was the same as what we do on our Investment Bank. It\u2019s taking the totality of managers, subjective judgment of performance in a multi-year view of how good a person is in his job for multiple years. All that together with the pay practices, how we defer compensation all are our sound policies and it\u2019s the application obviously that you have to get right.","Matt, who is now running CIO I\u2019m sure will just bring his own individual management style to doing that, but we didn\u2019t walk away with the feeling that there is anything different about that even with the company or that the company broadly should be doing differently around in administering compensation.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","And the idea now that we don\u2019t have a synthetic in CIO, clearly that\u2019s going to mean we should probably just assume more volatile results out of that business and particularly in times when credits getting a little funky.","Douglas L. Braunstein","No, no.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","Well, I mean obviously we\u2026","Douglas L. Braunstein","I show you the portfolio.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","As an exception.","Douglas L. Braunstein","I showed it was AA+. It\u2019s an AFS portfolio. It\u2019s not mark-to-market and P&L. It\u2019s got a 3.7 year average life, 80% government guaranteed, or government type of entity guaranteed. You\u2019re not going to move all to in it. If we have a small hedge there, if we are sure and you see we hedge more in Europe, that\u2019s what we need when doing a hedge. That really has very good AFS, but the AFS\u2019s subordinates rest of the company. Nothing would please us more than to reduce AFS and make some more great loans. So they can\u2019t say, we pay just from the revenues there, broadly because they\u2019re not there for that, where do they manage this portfolio. We need some very good people. There\u2019s $350 billion, it operates actually how many countries, on multiple currencies. So it is, we need some very good people managing that book just exactly what (inaudible) were BlackRock fixed income portfolio.","Sarah M. Youngwood","(Inaudible)","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. Doug, can you just help us understand, why the default servicing expenses aren\u2019t coming through as fast as you thought and when they might start coming through?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Yeah, so I mentioned three things obviously we operate some of the consent order; second is, this independent foreclosure review, those cost are larger and are going on longer than we expected; and then third is, we just continue to have a lot of defaults properties that we\u2019re processing through.","Jamie Dimon","Those will be coming down.","Douglas L. Braunstein","Those will come down over time but they have \u2013 they remained at a level. So our expectation is we\u2019ve thought we\u2019d seen movement in the second, third and fourth quarter.

Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Inc.","Hey, good morning. Doug, just a question for you on the margin, just wanted to help, if you can flush out why we saw a decline and it seem like in the trading asset you had securities borrowed turned negative in terms of the yield, other trading assets understood that you have a lower rate environment, but on the flip side, the cost of the trading assets on the liability side seem to go up. So just if you could \u2013 is that the hedging impact or can you just kind of explain a little bit more detail on why we\u2019re seeing this dynamic of the negative spread and securities borrowed and other issues?","Douglas L.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. ","Marianne Lake","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","Starting on Page 1, the firm reported fourth quarter net income of $7.1 billion and EPS of $1.98 on revenue of nearly $27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Market impacts aside, underlying business drivers remain solid, increasing core loans and deposit growth, consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season, faster market activity and the credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses. ","For the full year 2018, the firm reported revenue of $111.5 billion and net income was $32.5 billion, both clear records even adjusting for the impacts of tax reform. And so, we\u2019re entering 2019 with good momentum across all businesses.","Turning to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $26.8 billion was up $1.1 billion or 4% year-on-year, driven by net interest income. NII was up $1.2 billion or 9% on higher rates and on loan and deposit growth. ","Non-interest revenue was down slightly, with lower market levels impacting Asset Wealth Management fees and Private Equity losses being offset by higher Card fees and Auto lease growth in CCB. ","Expense of $15.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year. The increase is related to investments we\u2019re making in technology, marketing, real estate and front office, as well as revenue-related costs including growth in Auto. This was partially offset by a reduction in FDIC fees. As we had hoped, the incremental surcharge was eliminated effective the end of the third quarter and this is a benefit of a little over $200 million for the quarter across our businesses. ","Credit trends remained favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up $240 million year-on-year, driven by changes in reserves. In Consumer, we built reserves of $150 million in Cards on loan growth. ","In Wholesale, over the last several quarters, we have seen net reserve releases and recoveries. However, this quarter, we had about $200 million of credit costs. Again largely reserve builds on select C&I client downgrades driven by a handful of names across multiple sectors. ","While we are constantly looking at the granular level, these downgrades are idiosyncratic and do not reflect signs of deterioration in our portfolio. The outlook for credit as we see it remains positive. ","Shifting for the full year results on Page 3, we have posted net income for the year of $32.5 billion, a return on tangible common equity of 17% and EPS of $9 a share. Net income was a record for the firm, as well as to each of our businesses even exceeding tax reform. ","Revenue of $111.5 billion is also record and was up nearly $7 billion or 7% year-on-year, $4.3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and Card margin expansion being offset by lower markets NII.","Non-interest revenues was up $2.5 billion or 5%, driven by CIB Markets and growth in Consumer being offset by Private Equity losses and the impact of spread widening on FCA. At the end of the year, the adjusted expense was $63.3 billion, up 6%, which brings our overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise. And although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis, remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth in Cards given tax reform. ","Adjusted for this or looking on a GAAP basis, we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the fourth quarter. ","On Credit, the environment remained favorable throughout 2018. Credit costs were $4.9 billion, down 8% driven by lower net reserve build in Consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sales. ","Moving on to Page 4 on balance sheet and capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12% flat to last quarter. Risk-weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading RWA given a combination of seasonality, market conditions and all the enhancements. Our net payout ratio for the quarter exceeded 100% and we repurchased $5.7 billion of shares. ","Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on Page 5. CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, nearly $15 billion of net income and an ROE of 28%. Customer satisfaction remains near all time highs across our businesses. ","For the quarter, core loans were up 5% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 8%, Card up 6% and Business Banking up 5%. Deposit grew 3%. Growth continues to slow given the rising rate environment, but importantly, we believe we continue to outpace the industry. ","Of note, this quarter, we opened the first 10 branches in our expansion markets increasing D.C., Boston and Philadelphia. And although it\u2019s clearly early, perception in the market and the performance of the new branches has been strong. Despite volatile markets, client investment assets were still up 3% and we saw record net new money flows for the year. ","Card sales were up 10%, debit sales up 11% and merchant processing volume up 17% reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season. And keeping with our focus on digital everything, of note, active mobile customers were up 3 million users or 11% year-on-year.","Revenues of $13.7 billion was up 13%. In Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 18% on higher deposit NII driven by margin expansion. Home Lending revenue was down 8%, driven by lower net production revenues in a low volume, highly competitive environment. ","And of note, while not a material driver of overall expense, revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense. And Cards, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 14%, driven by higher Card NII, although loan growth and margin expansion, lower card, net acquisition costs, principally Sapphire Reserve and higher Auto lease volumes. Card revenue rate was 11.6% for the quarter and 11.27% for the year as expected. ","Expense of $7.1 billion was up 6%, driven by investments in technology and marketing and Auto lease appreciation partly offset by lower FDIC charges and other expense efficiencies. ","On Credit, net charge-offs was down $18 million as modestly higher charge-offs in Card were more than offset by lower charge-offs in Auto and Home Lending. Charge-off rates were down year-on-year across all portfolios. ","Economic indicators remain upbeat. And given the breadth and depth of our franchise, we have a pretty good barometer. From everything we see, the US Consumer remains very healthy. ","Now turning to Page 6 on the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $3 billion and ROE of 10% on revenue of $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the year, net income was nearly $12 billion and an ROE of 16%. In Banking, it was a record year for both total fees and advisory fees. We ranked number one in Global IB fees for the 10th consecutive year, gaining share across all regions. ","Fourth quarter IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 3%. We feel continued momentum in advisory with fees up 38% driven by the closing of several large transactions. For the year, we ranked Number 2 in wallet gaining share. ","Equity underwriting fees were down 4% but significantly outperforming the market. We ranked Number 1 for the year and the quarter and saw our leadership positions across all products globally with particular strength in IPOs as well as in the technology and healthcare sectors.","And debt underwriting fees were down 19% versus a strong prior year and sectors in the market. We maintained our number one brand rank for the year and continued to hold strongly lead-left positions in high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.","Moving to markets. Total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6% reported and down 11% adjusted for the impact of tax reform and Steinhoff margin loan loss last year. A confluence of factors throughout the quarter including trade, concerns around global growth and corporate earnings, fears of lower mortgage fares as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility which were amplified by markets that assets and liquidity. And although we saw decent client flow, rates rallied, spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly, all against general market conviction that was anticipating a stronger end to the year. As a result, fixed income markets in particular were challenging with revenue down 18% adjusted. Weaker performance across rates, credit trading and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets.","Equities revenue was up 2% adjusted, a solid end to a record year. Client continued to do well but we saw client deleveraging over the course of the quarter and cash derivatives were solid in a tougher environment.","Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13%, driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefitting from fee growth on higher volumes. Security services revenue was a $1 billion, up 1%. Underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit. Credit adjustments and other was a loss of $243 million, reflecting higher funding spreads on all derivatives.","Finally, expense of $4.7 billion was up slightly with continued investments in technology and bankers and volume-related transaction costs, partly offset by lower FDIC charges and lower performance-based compensation. The comps and revenue ratio for the quarter and for the year was 28%.","Moving to commercial banking on page seven. The commercial bank reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 20% for the fourth quarter, and for the year $4 billion of net income and a ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.3 billion for the quarter was down 2%, and for prior year included a tax reform related benefit. Excluding this, revenue was up 3%, driven by higher deposit NII. Gross IB revenue of $600 million was down 1% year-on-year but up 4% sequentially on a strong underlying flow of activity, particularly in M&A. Full-year IB revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 4% on strong activity across segments, in particular middle market banking which was up 8%.","Deposit balances were up 1% sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest toward year-end although down 7% year-on-year as we continue to see migration of non-operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives. We believe we are retaining a significant portion of these flows. Expense of $845 million was down 7% year-on-year as the prior year included $100 million of impairment on leased assets. Excluding this, expense was up 5%, driven by continued investment in the business in banker coverage as well as in technology and product initiatives.","Loans were up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 1%, reflecting a decline in our tax exempt portfolio given tax reform. Adjusting for this, we would have been up 4%, which is still below the industry as we focus on client selection, pricing and credit discipline. But keep in mind, in areas where we have chosen to grow such as in our expansion markets, we are growing at or about industry benchmarks. CRE loans were up 2%, also below the industry as we proactively slowed our growth due to where we are in the cycle, through continued structural and pricing discipline and targeted selections as we build. Underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs at a $106 million including higher loan loss reserves, largely due to select client downgrades.","Moving on to assets and wealth management on page eight. Assets and wealth management reported net income of $604 million with a pretax margin of 23% and an ROE of 26% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, net income was nearly $3 billion pretax margin at 26% and an ROE of 31%. Revenue of $3.4 billion for the quarter was down 5% year-on-year with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as to a lesser extent, lower performance fees. These were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows. Expense of $2.6 billion was flat, as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance-based compensation and lower revenue-driven external fees.","For the quarter, we saw net long-term outflows of $3 billion with strength in fixed income more than offset by outflows from equity and multi-asset products. Additionally, we had net liquidity inflows of $21 billion. For the 10th consecutive year, we saw net long-term inflows of $25 billion this year, driven predominantly by multi-assets and in addition saw $31 billion of net liquidity inflows this year. Assets under management of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were both down 2% as the impact of market levels more than offset the benefit of net inflows. Deposits were flat sequentially and down 7% year-on-year, reflecting migration into investments, and we continue to capture the vast majority inflows. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 13% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending.","Moving to page nine and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $577 million. Treasury and CIO net income of a $175 million was up year-on-year, primarily driven by higher rates. Other corporate saw a net loss of $752 million, including on a pre-tax basis funding our foundation for corporate philanthropy $200 million this quarter, flat year-on-year, and including a $150 million of markdown on certain legacy private equity investments market related. Remainder is driven by tax-related items, totaling a little over a $300 million. And within this are two notable components. The first is regularly tax reserve; and second represents small differences between the effective tax rate for each for our businesses and that for the overall company as we close the year. So, therefore there is an offset across our businesses. Our full-year effective tax rate was just a little over 20%, in line with guidance. ","Moving to page 10 and outlook. We will give you more full-year outlook and sensitivity information at Investor Day as always. However, for now, I would like to provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. Net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates and growth but quarter-over-quarter will be negatively impacted by day count. And we expect the first quarter NII to be relatively flat sequentially. While it\u2019s too early clearly to give guidance on fee revenues, it\u2019s also fair to say that this quarter market is still calmer and more positive and capital market pipelines are strong. So, if the environment remains positive, we would expect normal seasonal strength in the first quarter. But I will remind you that the first quarter of 2018 included a $500 million accounting write off as well as broad strength in performance. Expect expense to be up mid-single-digits year-on-year, obviously market dependent, primarily annualization effects. And finally, as I said, we expect credit to remain favorable across products.","So, to close, while the markets in the fourth quarter were more challenging, we should not lose sight to the fact that 2018 was a strong year, indeed a record for revenues, net income and EPS, both reported and adjusted for tax reform. Fundamental economic data remains supportive of continued growth, and we\u2019re generally constructive on the outlook for 2019. We have good momentum coming into the year and the company and each of our businesses are very well positioned.","With that, operator, we can open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning. So, the way bank stocks have performed, clearly, investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near-term and of course credit, which you addressed. I\u2019m wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected, if the overhead ratio of 57% that you posted in \u201817 and \u201818 is something that you could continue to level off to, or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when we\u2019re thinking about the overhead ratio.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say a couple of things. The first is just to remind you that \u201817 and \u201818, I would look at a GAAP rather than a managed basis because of the adjustments to our revenues from tax reform. But that said, we have -- while we don\u2019t set expense target, nor do we set overhead ratio targets, we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that combination of revenue growth and expense discipline, notwithstanding the investments that we\u2019ve been making, we should see our overhead ratio continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid-50, so 55ish%. Obviously, the timing of that will depend on rates and markets and everything else. So, we would expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage on higher NII on growth if nothing else and continued solid growth in fees. Clearly in any one quarter, you can have pluses and minuses that can be market-dependent. But generally, over time, we would still expect those trends.","Erika Najarian","And just as a follow-up question, the market is also thinking that the last rate hike from the Fed was December, and I'm wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if December was indeed the last rate hike for some time.","Marianne Lake","So, I would say, first of all just to say that the question mark about whether that\u2019s a pause or a stop; is it the end of the cycle, we don\u2019t think so. We think the outlook for growth and the economy is still strong; the consumer is still strong and healthy; and we are expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward. Having said that, just as a general matter, you\u2019ve seen through our earnings at risk that as we have put more and more of the benefit of past rate cut, rate hikes in our run rate, each incremental hike from here has whilst deposited significantly lower sort of incremental NII drive, and that -- the front end SKU is a lower percentage. So, it\u2019s nothing but clearly lower front end rates or lower long end of the curve or a flatter curve, all other things would be net modestly negative. But against that, you pointed out the potential for this to lead to lower or slower reprice.","So, as the Fed pauses, it is fair to say there could be an offset from lower reprice as people digest the data and understand whether this is a pause or not. We would still look -- we delivered $4.3 billion of NII growth in 2018. We will still benefit in 2019 from the annualization effects of the higher rates we\u2019ve already had as well as solid growth. So, while you kind of expect 2019 over \u201818 to be at that level, it would still be strong NII growth year-on-year.","Jamie Dimon","I would say why it\u2019s equally if not more important than it was. So, if it is a pause because you are going to recession, you\u2019re going to do trades that obviously is very different than it\u2019s to pause, economy is strong and they raise rates, you know which one you would choose.","Marianne Lake","And if this were the end of the cycle, it\u2019s not a cycle we\u2019ve ever seen before. So, in that scenario, if terminal Fed run rates 2.5% -- 4.5%, 5%, plus, I think we\u2019ve never seen that movie before but that\u2019s not our central case. And by the way, the house did a research view. We would still need to see incremental hike this year; if not in the first half, in the second.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe a question on the card business. There has been chatter about sort of pulling back on rewards to kind of focus more on profitability. I guess, how do you think about the strategy in cards right now? And can that -- I think the revenue yield in the card business was up 7 bps to 11.57. Can that go higher from here as you maybe pull back on rewards?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I would say that when we think about the product continuum we have in the contrast, rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers. Customers are very attuned to it and are looking for value in the product. Value and simplicity and ease of use are the three things in the products that we deliver. So, for us, engage relationships, drive profitability, this is still a very profitable business. So, while we will always make adjustments to our offerings, it\u2019s not the case that we are looking at a meaningful pullback in rewards. And if you think about -- think for example our banking where we are looking to bring the impact of our products together, we are continuing to offer rewards-based incentive to drive engagement with our customers. So, we think it\u2019s a solid strategy of business that already has good returns. It\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve seen a lot of competitive response and competitive products in the marketplace that are driving high rewards offerings too and we\u2019ve not seen that lower -- our ability to acquire new accounts. So, we feel great about the value proposition, the simplicity and the compelling products that we have. So, it\u2019s very profitable business.","Jim Mitchell","So, we think about still seeing decent growth, how do we think about card losses specifically this year? You seem pretty optimistic on credit. Should we still expect some seasoning or do you think the macro trends are that positive that we hold steady? How do you think about credit and cards?","Marianne Lake","So, I think the macro trends are definitely positive. So, we are creating tailwinds, but it's also true we talked about the fact that if you go back to 2014-2015 that we had expanded our credit box, we'd expanded it intentionally at higher risk-adjusted margins. But over the course of the last couple of years as we've experienced that performance, we've done sort of surgical risk pullbacks, and we amended our collection strategy, all of which have led to a charge-off rate for the fourth quarter in \u201818 that's down slightly year-on-year and for the year that's a 310 basis points which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations, even as late as the end of last year. So, we feel great that that kind of loss trends at that 310, maybe a little bit higher is something we should look forward to at least into 2019. And it will be helped by a supportive macro environment.","And we are seeing, if you unpick all of our trends, you see the phenomenon of three vintages. You see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates. You see the older expansion vintages that have crossed peak delinquencies and are trending to a more stable level. And then you do have, obviously with new acquisitions, cohorts that are still seasoning. That will continue. But, net-net, we're expecting relatively stable loss rate that levels similar to 2018.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. I'm sorry, his line has disconnected. Our next question is from John McDonald of Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning. Just wondering on the markets commentary, obviously super early in the quarter, but you mentioned things feeling better. Can you just talk about seasonality there but also just what feels better so far? And then, also in the fourth quarter, what you saw in leverage lending market, how much do you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and the hung deals? Little bit of color there would be helpful.","Marianne Lake","Sure. Okay. So, I would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging and there was a lot of market moves, a big sort of broad set of. And at that point, there were elevated concerns around trade, global growth data was causing concerns, there were concerns that the Fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about. So, there was a lot of negativity, we think too much negativity priced into the fourth quarter. And it started to change a bit when we saw the first really strong unemployment trend which reminded people that there's a very long distance between 3% growth and a contraction. So, yes, we could see slower growth but still growth in the U.S. and across the globe, a slightly more constructive narrative on trade and that continues to broadly progress we hope and believe in a positive direction, and a more dovish outlook from the Fed that potential for that to be pauses in rates or being relatively supportive. And the fact that a lot of people were on the sidelines through the fourth quarter and investor appetite is out there for good value where it can be found.","So, I would say just early days in the first quarter. There are still obviously risks to the outlook. And any of those things could go the worse direction. But so far, things are just a little bit more positive and that's constructive. And therefore you would hope to see normal seasonal strength in January.","On leveraged loans, sort of just diving into the sort of potential for that to be hung bridges, it\u2019s true that there was a significant market correction with spreads widening across high yield bonds and leveraged loans in the fourth quarter. Clearly, stepping back, while the industry -- leveraged finance commitments are -- they are materially down from before the crisis and very different. So, credit fundamentals look pretty good. Having said that -- and by the way, we passed on a lot of deals in the fourth quarter. We've maintained sort of our sort of protection in terms of flex pricing and flex protection. And as a result, the more maturity of our bridge that has -- still got decent cushion. That\u2019s not to say that there's no deal that has the potential for there to be net losses after fee, but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter. I would also say that coming back to the first quarter that actually the market could be quite constructive to fixed income into the third quarter, given a more dovish Fed supporting corporate margin, corporate default rates are going to stay pretty low and we do have time. So, none of the deals that we have need to be brought to market in a hurry, and the market is moving in a positive direction.","Operator","Our next question is from Al Alevizakos of HSBC.","Al Alevizakos","Thank you for taking my question. I again want to focus a bit on the market's performance. You pretty much mentioned like weakness across the board in credit, in FX, in rates, which I assume like is the case. First of all, I want bit of an outlook on how you think rates will perform now that volatility has picked up. And more importantly, you mentioned strength in emerging markets. Can I ask whether that was primarily in Asia or LatAm? Thank you very much.","Marianne Lake","So, it\u2019s no good of a conserve talking about how we think things are going to pan out in time in the first quarter other than just the general comment I\u2019ve already made, which is the environment should be more constructive and we\u2019re expecting decent volatility in client activity and we will see how that pans out. With respect to emerging markets, Latin America was a big piece but Asia too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","I guess, I\u2019m a little torn between the year and the quarter. So, I\u2019ll just ask it to Jamie. Jamie, it seems like you guys are very happy with the year with all the record revenues and earnings. But, the fourth quarter, are you happy with the fourth quarter, given expenses, credit, fees?","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019m fully happy with it. The franchise is strong, we\u2019re investing in new products and services, but we\u2019re not immune from the weather and volumes and volatility. We\u2019re not immune from market prices and assets going up and down. And I like the loans up 6%, assets up, long-term flows up. I like the fact that credit card spend is up 10%, merchant processing is up 17%. Shares -- in almost every business, market shares have gone up. That\u2019s what I look at. I really don\u2019t pay that much attention to speed bump it a little bit but the fact that volumes were low in the last three weeks of December. I honestly could care less. I look at more in equities. We\u2019ve gained share and we\u2019re now bumping up to number one. Those folks have done a great job, of course cash, derivatives, prime broker et cetera. And fixed income has maintained our share and we\u2019re adding products and services around the world. And we don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to happen next quarter and I don\u2019t care.","Marianne Lake","And we take the same division, we had strong first half of the year and we said long may it continue but it may not and one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend. And so, we don\u2019t really react to the sort of micro, even though it was driven by the macro. The really underlying business drivers continue to be strong. And even in those businesses, we are holding leadership positions and gaining share. And so, this too will cost and things will continue to move forward in a constructive manner.","Mike Mayo","As a follow-up, let\u2019s talk about the weather. So, the weather is lousy at the end of the year and Jamie you were just appointed to your third year as Chairman of the Business Roundtable. So, in that role, what are you doing to help JPMorgan and I guess the other banks in terms of China, the government shutdown, immigration, some of these headline issues that Marianne talked about, having hurt the CIB in the fourth quarter?","Jamie Dimon","Yes. So, December is terrible but if you look at January, you have half of it back, generally in spreads and markets and stuff like that. And as BRT, I don\u2019t do anything that benefits JPMorgan. That\u2019s about public policy, that\u2019s good for growth of America in total, and so very specifically stayed away from doing about banks there. But the BRT does take up trade and we are supportive of the fact there are serious issues with China. We would like to see the trade deal get done. It looks like to us they are marching along at least to this March 1st deadline date that enough will be done to kind of get an extension and hopefully complete the deal. We would like to see immigration reform, so proper border security, allowing people who have advance degrees to stay here, having the doctors stay here, having more merit-based immigration and having some path to citizenship. That is the BRT position. We want more innovation. We\u2019d like to reduce regulations at the local and federal level that stop small business formation. So, if you look at the BRT, there are 10 verticals around that -- and we try to do things that are good for the growth of America. ","And bad policy can slow down the growth of America. I have pointed out over and over it takes 12 years to get the permits to build the bridge. And it took eight years to put a man on the moon. It is time that we reform ourselves and not blame anybody else for own lack of that we don't have kids getting at school of educations where they get jobs, the innovation has slowdown, the government R&D spending is down. I always think what can you do better and there is plenty in this country to do better to help growth over the long run. And it\u2019s not about helping it next quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Follow-up on John\u2019s question earlier on leverage lending. On slide 24, you see the balance on loans held for sale go from like $6.5 billion to $15 billion. I heard your comments on marks. I'm assuming that that is just disruption and you go back towards your normal level that's in the pipes and progress, but I just want to make sure that I'm not making that wrong assumption.","Marianne Lake","Yes. We are not expecting anything to be elevated.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, cool. And\u2026","Jamie Dimon","That number goes up or down over time just based on episodic -- what is cleared out of the books. There is nothing in our number we are afraid of.","Glenn Schorr","Understood. Curious on the credit on the couple of marks and C&I, I'm just curious on how much of that is internal versus external rating agency. And I guess, it's a feel for the underlying fundamentals. How do you know we should treat that as idiosyncratic as you go?","Marianne Lake","So, it\u2019s internal and it\u2019s like lines, sectors. We know the specifics, it is situationally specific. Remember, just to give you some context, while those can drive the dollar value, regular way in any quarter given the size of our portfolio, we might downgrade and upgrade hundreds of individual names based upon the circumstances. So, when we say that we are looking at it and saying that things are idiosyncratic, it\u2019s not just looking at the five situations that drive the biggest sort of value, it\u2019s also looking at the hundreds of downgrades and hundreds of upgrades and seeing if there is any trends or net worrying concern, and honestly not now. Then, so if anything, marginally, we had more upgrades but it\u2019s just -- there is nothing to see right now in our portfolios and we are looking.","Jamie Dimon","We look for reasons to put up reserves, not to take them down.","Marianne Lake","We are more paranoid than you are.","Glenn Schorr","Last one, obviously markets all went down in the fourth quarter and we had some freeze-ups if you will in high yield first time in like 10 years. But, I'm curious how you all think the markets functioned in general? In other words, things went down, spreads widened out, there was lots of fear but it felt like the plumbing was working. But, I don't want to put words in your mouth.","Jamie Dimon","And half the people weren\u2019t even here the last two weeks in December.","Marianne Lake","That\u2019s right. The plumbing was working; we didn\u2019t see any sort of technology issues; we didn\u2019t see any volumes that can be coped with. While I said that there was a lack of debt to markets and liquidity, that\u2019s typically the case when you have one way trends in the market and there are people similarly situated. So, I would say they relatively functioned well, but challenging.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","Andrew Lim","I just had a follow-on question from the vesting high yield mark's question. You seem to be getting the impression that there weren\u2019t really much in the way of marks. Is that because you\u2019ve got very strong hedging strategies in place and that the decline in FICC revenues mainly was due to lower volumes?","Jamie Dimon","There were no marks.","Marianne Lake","There were no marks. In our business right now, we have -- for the vast majority, we have good cushion and we expect to be able to a clear and price through market. And anything that even border line, it\u2019s completely not material.","Jamie Dimon","I think there are few marks, if you look at what happened to flex pricing like mid-December when things were the worst, yes, some of these things were very close to the end of their flex pricing. And that means they are very close to have you some kind of mark. Of course, since then, the spreads have come, come back 40%.","Marianne Lake","Right.","Andrew Lim","Interesting, thanks. And then, my follow-up question is that obviously that capital markets had a tough time but you are wholesale lending, the growth has accelerated quite nicely. Do you get the impression that corporates had a general shift to seek borrowing from banks such as yourselves because they were shut out of the market?","Marianne Lake","I mean, there was an uptick at the end of the year, you saw it in the industry data, we saw it in our spot data. For us in fact, it was largely driven by one investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter but there was a little bit of an uptick and a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing and the balance sheet but nothing I would call -- nothing that I would call unusual or a trend. We didn't have to take down things that would otherwise not play in the market.","Operator","The next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I wanted to circle back on the expense flexibility. I think in your base case, you're pretty clear that you're targeting positive operating leverage and moving down the efficiency ratio to the mid-50s. But, what is some of the expense flexibility and where would it come from, if the revenues slide. I think in 2018, you accelerated some technology spend, given tax reform, you've been opening branches. Some of that stuff obviously can't be pulled back, but you always talk about some areas of flexibility. So, maybe what are those? And if you could kind of size or help quantify some of the flexibility you have, that'd be helpful.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say, first of all that you saw that from 2013 through \u201816, we had a pretty structural expense reduction program associated with simplifying our businesses. So, in terms of the low hanging fruit and things like that, we would say largely that\u2019s been harvested. We are always looking to generate core operating efficiencies so that we can absorb growth. And when we are investing in technology and data, one of the reasons to do it, customer satisfaction, product innovation aside is efficiency. So, we are seeing some of that come through. We\u2019ll continue to drive that down.","Jamie Dimon","But the efficiencies and the investments are all in the number that Marianne gives you when she says up 5%.","Marianne Lake","That\u2019s right. The way I would say it is that we continue to drive for expense discipline. But as long as you feel as we do that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we're making which we think are strategically important for long-term growth of the company and the profitability of the company, supporting clients, if those are good decisions for long term growth, while we could obviously make changes, we would not look to do that. And so, marketing expense for example is one area where you would say there's pretty sizeable and immediate flexibility. Nevertheless, when we invest in marketing, we're driving new accounts and engage customers that drive long-term growth. So, we invested through the cycle. We think it sort of differentiates our long term performance and we'd like to continue to do that. 2019 over \u201818, you wouldn't expect to see necessarily the same clip up that you saw last year, we did accelerate investments in \u201818 and so more of the growth will be revenue related but still decent investments as the opportunity is still good to do that.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on a sidebar here on the reserve build as we think about credit quality, are we just in the period now where we should assume kind of some reserve build consistent with loan growth each quarter or was this just a quarter where you had a couple of the lumpiness that really drove? I guess what I'm getting at is, last quarter you had modeled -- I guess what I'm getting at is like, it's -- are we at the point where like just a couple of lumpy loans was going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just -- maybe it's a bit unusual still.","Marianne Lake","So, first of all, I'd sort of point out that in the cost base we hopefully continue to grow healthy mid-single-digits, the seasonality. There is seasonality to card balances and losses. And so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year. That's what we saw this year and actually a little bit lower year-on-year than last. And in the wholesale space you're going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic given the nature of the loans that we have. I wouldn't necessarily say that we expect to see a trend from significant reserves but we've been factored by recoveries and releases over the course of the last couple of years partly or in large part at least earlier releasing reserves we took on energy when the energy went through the downturn. So, we'll have some downgrades. We might have some releases. I would, net-net, think that as we grow, we would build but not this proportionally. We\u2019re obviously at a best point in the cycle. So, Jamie mentioned it earlier, to the degree that we have the flexibility, we\u2019re making sure that we are reserved accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","A lot of talk on macroeconomics and the policy backdrop in volatile markets, but as you mentioned earlier, you guys are in a pretty unique position and that you have pretty consistent dialogue with a lot of economic agents whether it\u2019s corporate, governments, institutional investors and whatnot. But just a sense of what your clients are saying, what are they concerned about? Is there any concern on your part that some of these issues have sort of a self-fulfilling effect and that it does end up leading to actions that precipitate a downturn or recession?","Marianne Lake","I think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data, which is still generally supportive and so I think should be good. But for sure, investments is not immune to external factors. And so manufacturing data has been a little weaker I would say. CapEx is sluggish on sales around global growth. Government shutdown and trade are not particularly help, uncertainty is not good to anyone. So, there is no doubt that as things continue, if there is a level of anxiety and uncertainty, it\u2019s just not constructive for confidence and confidence that gets stronger or less strong market. I wouldn\u2019t say that I think it\u2019s clear and present. But I think we should be extremely careful because sentiment particularly consumer sentiment will be incredible important. And right now it\u2019s good, sentiment in consumer and we just got back some sentiment from I hope small middle market companies that while not at their high, but still very high.","Saul Martinez","That's helpful. If I could just ask about loan growth and is it just a more-broad question about your ability to continue to outpace the industry? And I suspect we\u2019ll get more color at Investor Day but just want to get your sense of the sustainability of growth and you mentioned on the commercial side, you maybe scale back a little bit, maybe we\u2019re late cycle. But, where do you feel like you can continue to outgrow the industry, where do you feel like maybe it's time to scale back on risk a little bit?","Marianne Lake","So, I think it\u2019s -- and incredibly nuance question, because in general, home lending has a challenging market backdrop. For us, it\u2019s tale of two cities. We\u2019re doing quite well and gaining a bit of share in the kind of retail purchase market. And we\u2019re holding the pricing discipline corresponding and leading share there. So, there is a challenging market backdrop, card was doing well at and it\u2019s sort factor of all things we talked about, investments in digital product, rewards all of the above. So, we would like to believe that we will continue to hold our own there. And auto is extremely competitive. We play in prime, super prime space. And we\u2019re seeing competition from people who have different economic drivers in our sight, credit unions and captives. And so, we\u2019re willing to lose share to maintain returns there.","You bifurcate C&I, we\u2019re growing in line, we\u2019re best in the industry in our expansion markets where we\u2019ve been making the investments, where we\u2019ve been adding specialized industry coverage. And we would like to see that because of the investments we\u2019re making. But in mature markets we\u2019re again being pretty prudent. I won\u2019t call it tightening but being very selective. And commercial real estate, particularly construction lending, yes, we\u2019re tightening. We\u2019re being very cautious about new deals and selective about it. So, it isn\u2019t the case anymore that we would say we\u2019re seeking to grow, although we ever were, loan growth is an outcome of number of factors, mainly the strategic dialog with our companies but also the environment we\u2019re in and it\u2019s extremely nuance. And in many of our businesses, we\u2019re going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point.","Jamie Dimon","So, maybe I\u2019ll just reemphasize that. We tell our management that we have no problem seeing loans books shrink. We\u2019re not going to be sitting here ever in our live to say and you got to grow the loan book, you got to show loan growth. Remember, Warren Buffett used to say in the insurance business and sometime it\u2019s true in the loan business, you\u2019re better off the sales force go play golf than there to make new loans. We\u2019re not going to be stupid. And the other thing you have to always keep in mind, it\u2019s not the loan, it\u2019s the relationships you look at in total. So, when it comes to middle market or all these other things are reasons that we stay in a business knowing there is going to be a cycle and we are not going to be children on this cycle. We know that losses are going to go up.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning. Are we playing golf all day yet or is that still far away?","Jamie Dimon","Credit is pristine, mortgage credit is pristine, middle market is pristine. Underwriting has been pretty good other than a few little pockets that Marianne has mentioned. We saw people stretching in auto, we saw some stretching in -- and we\u2019re not going to self fund credit card, but little bit people are stretching in that. And leverage lending, we\u2019re not worried about all loan book. I think you can have a logical conversation. But there is kind of a nonbank loan book. But that\u2019s not our concern. And it is what it is at the time\u2026","Marianne Lake","And I think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship driven. So, think about kind of no new relationship, commercial term lending real estate banking, mortgage to a lesser degree also. We are seeing -- we are losing or seeking share where it makes sense to do it.","Jamie Dimon","Yes. And competition, we mentioned this before, it\u2019s back everywhere, and that\u2019s a good thing for America. And that means the pricing is little tough and you have compete.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. So, we are still off the golf course, all right. That\u2019s good. Just wanted to understand a little bit more on the expense side. I know it was -- even with the weather, you guys put out a 14% ROTCE, which is obviously best-in-class. The question is on the expenses, there is flexibility there but yet I know you\u2019ve guided to up single digits in 1Q \u201819. Based on the prior conversation, it seems like 1Q might be in aberration of mid single digits or should I take that that\u2019s kind of the run rate you are expecting for the full year? So, why would 1Q be a little bit different I guess is really the question?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I wouldn\u2019t fully annualize the first quarter. But think about we\u2019ve added bankers and advisors across our businesses. So, you\u2019re going to get annualization impact, particularly first quarter to first quarter. We have added more and more as the year progressed. Similarly, something like auto lease where we grew our auto lease business, revenues and expenses strongly in 2018 and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter. So, front office, auto lease, some of the technology investments we have making, the annualization of those will be more pronounced first quarter to first quarter than fourth quarter to fourth quarter because many of them are in our run rate in the fourth quarter. And then outside of that there is a bit more in real estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy. And then marketing, foundation completion, those things -- there is going to be timing. So, the first quarter will be higher. I wouldn\u2019t annualize it. We are going to see nicely growth year-over-year much more because of revenue growth than the corporate investment of both year-on-year, not the same level as last year. And we will obviously give you a lot more detail and insights and thoughts on ranges and everything at Investor Day clearly.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Just a quick question on the balance sheet; I\u2019m if you gave us already. But just walk through the idea of lowering down the deposit with banks and kind of moving into repo, what you saw in the quarter and then kind of is that just something that was temporary, that\u2019s expected to reverse in the first quarter?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, it\u2019s fair to say that money market rates traded above IOER throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter. And so through the quarter and that year-end, we will able to take advantage of the market opportunity to move out of cash into cash alternatives, things, reverse repos and short duration assets. And so, for us, it was yield-enhancing opportunity to redeploy cash and a mix change rather than adding duration. And that continues to be the case into the first quarter. It contributed to our NIM expansion in fourth quarter. We continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter and it\u2019s a market opportunity.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then, a separate question on, I know it\u2019s not a big revenue driver anymore but within mortgage banking, you had a negative gain on sale in the quarter. Could you just give us some color there, what drove a negative gain on sale?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, in the quarter, and as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet, we actually did a sale of conforming loans to GSE of about $5 billion. And the impact of that was perhaps a loss on the sale of the portfolio, given that they'd been originated at lower rates. So, as rates are higher, the fair value of the loan is lower. Against that, if you were to look at the rest of the P&L, you'll see a benefit in net interest income because the interest rate risk of that has been transferred to the Treasury Department. So, it's geography, it's a loss on the sale of a portfolio against which there's funding breakage in NII. Just so that you know, when we -- our mortgage loan with RWA 50% versus security at 20% with better liquidity value, we did reinvest some of those proceeds in mortgage-backed securities in treasury. So, we will earn that back over time, net for the company.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","Hey, good morning. So, I wanted to start with just a bigger picture question on credit and the impact of normalization. Certainly, the near-term guidance sounds quite encouraging. Jamie, you did make a comment recently at investor conference talking about how the banking industry is over-earning on credit, not particularly a controversial remark. But in the past, you guided to a medium-term loss rate blended basis of roughly 65 bps. That does contemplate continued loan losses in commercial. And just given that we\u2019re late cycle, I was hoping you can maybe speak to your expectation for what a normalized credit loss rate is for JPMorgan, given your current mix and where that might differ from your medium-term loss guidance?","Jamie Dimon","So, we're not talking quarter-over-quarter, we\u2019re just taking in general trends\u2026","Steven Chubak","I'm talking in bigger picture.","Jamie Dimon","So, Marianne has shown year-to-year we consider it normalized losses. And for years, we've been doing better than that. In credit card, middle market, large corporate, mortgage has come back down to a very low number. And at one point, it's going to go up. And so, I'm not -- we're not telling you what's going to happen next quarter. Right now, it looks like it\u2019s kind of steady state. But at one point we will not be surprised see it go up. I don't know if it could be second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, and I don't know if we\u2019re relate cycle. We don't exactly know where we're in the cycle. And so, we just won\u2019t be surprised to see it go up. And the number -- if we look at it by product, we're looking at a total that can actually -- may vary against the total.","Marianne Lake","I think, I hate to say this because I know that you don't want to wait a few weeks but we'll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of total outcomes on credit at Investor Day but we -- when we gave our medium-term simulation we said listen, we did a 17 return on tangible common equity in 2018 and our medium-term guidance is for 17%. We under earned against our guidance in other parts of the cycle. Maybe we\u2019ll over-earn against it. But NII and repo bags are higher and credit is benign. And at some point, we would expect both of those things to normalize but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers. So, we don't know when it will be and actually don't see anything that -- I know you say in the second, third or fourth quarter. There's no indication that it's in any of those quarters. But, we'll have a more comprehensive discussion at Investor Day about range of total outcomes.","Steven Chubak","We're looking forward to that. And just one follow-up for me on the IB outlook, Marianne, I was hoping I could unpack to some of your comments around the -- how the IB backlog. You cited that as being quite strong. But just looking at the individual businesses for M&A, ECM, DCM, especially given some the economic pressures outside the U.S. what informs your outlook across each of those?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say that first of all, we did see, given the conditions in the fourth quarter, a number of deals that got pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, particularly in ECM and DCM, in M&A there was a bit more balance so every deal that got pushed or stopped, there were more that came to take its place. But as a result as we go into the first quarter, pipelines across the board are elevated relative to last year and pretty strong. And at the end of the day, we talked about earlier, confidence is still high, companies are still motivated to drive growth. And so, the environment should be constructive for continued M&A. Technology, healthcare, biotech innovation, technology innovation, momentum in ECM that we've been benefiting from and the IPO pipeline should continue market dependent. And notwithstanding December, actually a sort of lower outlook for rates in the U.S., should broadly be a tailwind for fixed income in the first quarter, the first half. So, the second half of the year, I think is going to be determined by how things shape up over the next several months. But looking into January, again, if the market remains generally constructive, we should see tailwinds across the businesses.","Jamie Dimon","I think potential backlogs, generally, you want them high because that\u2019s good, but they\u2019re all like an accordion, too, they come and go. So, that\u2019s not a forecast for the future that you\u2019d definitely get those revenues. They could get delayed, particularly things like IPO that you\u2019ve already seen. I just want to point out, the shout out to the folks in the investment bank, our market share went up in Europe, Asia, Latin America and United States last year. That\u2019s what we really look at when we look at the business.","Marianne Lake","60 basis points full-year.","Jamie Dimon","60 basis points all year. And first time ever, it went in all four major in markets. ","Operator","Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Jamie, I was glad that you mentioned that we don't know the red end of the cycle because that's kind of just assume because of that lapse of time, but not really the economic factors. And then the other piece of this is, when you look at losses, they tend to be good until they go into recession. Then, they are bad. There is no just kind of normalization. So, the question about a normal rate of loss that we really have two dichotomous answers. We have a good answer, which is when we\u2019re expanding and the economy is stable, and we have a bad answer or recession. It's kind of one or the other. Just want to see what you thought about that.","Jamie Dimon","You\u2019re exactly right. At one point you\u2019re going to over and at one point you\u2019re going to under run. And we try to -- when we look at the business, we kind of try to price through that. So, we\u2019re trying to earn fair returns through the cycle. And I totally agree with you. We know it\u2019s going to -- they are going to change at one point. And we try to do a better job underwriting too but we do work hard and make sure we underwrite other people as best we can.","Marty Mosby","Which then limits the volatility when you go into that bad period, which is what you want to do. You underwrite to make sure you're defending against that cycle.","Jamie Dimon","Exactly, and the other one you have is the reserves. You put them up, you take them down. So, our total reserve is what 14 billion? But at one point they were 30. So, we went from -- in the great recession, went from 7 to 30 back to 14. And I call it income paper. It doesn\u2019t mean advantages, but when you go into that recession, your losses go up, any reserves have to go up. And we\u2019re completely aware of that.","Marianne Lake","Although I think we have to say, for obvious reason, that we wouldn\u2019t expect any near-term recession if there is one to anything like it did before. And even if it did, given the credit quality of the portfolio, performance will be not only absolutely better but we think strong on a relative basis.","Jamie Dimon","Other than -- if you look at the consumer, that $13 trillion that's outstanding, other than student, which is fundamentally owned by the government, the more stuff that's been written is prime. So, back to $10 trillion, it is much better than what it was in \u201807. And I think credit card, I forgot the exact numbers, much more prime than was in \u201807. I think order is about the same but order actually outperformed, more prime and outperformed in the great recession. I think people in general have done a better job underwriting middle market and leveraged up than it did last time. I think if you start a recession soon, going into it, the credit portfolio is much stronger than last time.","Marty Mosby","And the follow-up question to that is, we talked about auto and some of those other places where you saw some of that deterioration, what our model showing is that actually the discipline and the reaction time to that deterioration is much quicker than when we saw the one to four family cycled the last time where you saw deterioration but growth just kept going. We had so many banks jump in and say, look, we\u2019ve already pulled back on auto lending, we pulled back on multifamily. There have already been places where you\u2019ve seen that discipline. So that discipline in itself put the governor on economic growth, which is why we're having less growth or slower growth but yet it also creates a like you said, a stronger portfolio for that eventual downturn.","Jamie Dimon","I agree with that. Lack of discipline we see is in student and a little bit in small commercial real estate.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys -- there has been a lot of talk about leveraged loans and how this time around everything seems to be underwritten better. Are there any tangible statistics that you can share with us or maybe on Investor Day you might do show us that yes the leveraged loan portfolio for you guys in particular is much healthier than maybe \u201806-\u201807? And then, second, on this leverage loan issue, outside the banking industry, what are some of the indirect hits that you and maybe some of your peers may experience, none from the direct hit of the leverage loan but for some of the craziness that's going on outside the banking industry?","Jamie Dimon","Yes. So, can I just give a big picture of this? I think $1.7 trillion of leveraged loans, okay. So, term A is about half of that. These are very rough numbers, okay, most of it with banks, and obviously safer than term B. A big chunk, over I think 60% or 70% of the term B is with nonbanks. And so, if you look at your at banking system, if you look at the leverage lending bridge book in \u201807, it was over $400 billion; today's it\u2019s number like 80. In \u201807, there were commitments and no flex and everyone has plenty of flex now. So, we look at covenants, so it\u2019s kind of covenants but there\u2019s flex and there is a whole bunch of stuff in there. So, it is far, far, far sounder today. Even these CLOs, you look to underwrite the CLOs, they are far better underwritten with more equity, more sub debt and more mezzanine stuff like that.","And go to shadow banks, they do things like differently. A lot of those folks are quite bright, they know what they're doing. Someone is going to get hurt there. And the issue there is in the next recession because the -- and remember, most of the major banks don\u2019t fund a lot of that. We aren\u2019t taking huge indirect exposure to that by funding some of the nonbanks. And I think the issue there is for the marketplace it\u2019s going to be -- when you have a recession, the lender will not be there. So, a lot of these borrowers will be stranded. So, that\u2019s not -- that\u2019s an opportunity or risk or something like that but it\u2019s not -- I wouldn\u2019t put it in the systemic category.","Again, if you go back to \u201807, we -- it emerged in \u201807 there was $1 trillion of bad mortgages that were kind of all over the place, the CLOs, SIBs. There are no SIBs. The CLOs are much smaller. The leverage lending book is much smaller book. Capital liquidity is much higher. So, it is nothing like \u201807. You will have a recession, it just won\u2019t be like you had last time affecting the banking system. It will affect the banking system. We are little bit canaries in the coal mine. We are not immune to what goes in the economy. But it won\u2019t be anything like you saw last time for most of the larger banks.","Gerard Cassidy","No. I agree with that. And do you think Janet Yellen and other Federal Reserve officials comments about leveraged lending is more directed to the exposure outside the banking industry than inside the banking industry?","Jamie Dimon","Yes, I do.","Marianne Lake","Yes.","Jamie Dimon","Yes. Again, I don\u2019t think they were saying it\u2019s huge and systemic. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s something that you should keep an eye on. I think that the regulatory do keep an eye on that.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just to pivot on deposit question. Obviously, noninterest bearing deposits are tough to keep as rates are going higher. Can you guys give us some color on the non-interest-bearing deposits? There is obviously a small decline. What parts of the business you're seeing there, and the Fed\u2019s unwind of its balance sheet, how much of an impact do you think that might be having on the non-interest-bearing deposits?","Marianne Lake","So, the migration into product from noninterest to interest bearing is predominantly or largely exclusively a wholesale thing. At this point there is not enough rate benefit in the interest bearing savings to drive into product migration, definitely some growth outlook in CDs given pricing, but it\u2019s wholesale right now and it\u2019s mainly rate-related and not balance sheet in terms of the Fed unwind.","Jamie Dimon","Can I just make a comment about interest rates and the balance sheet of Fed? So, the interest rate is one thing but the balance sheet of Fed obviously is causing changes in the flow of funds. It\u2019s causing changes in that banks now have options other than reserves at the central bank because the two-year and three-year bond yields for corporate -- government bond is much higher, some people are preferring to own that because they think it would be paid better than corporate risk. So, changing the whole bunch of fund flows concerns people, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s part and process of normalization.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","There were couple of Fed or regulatory documents out in late December, one is codifying the three-year burning of stated seasonal impacts and another one where they are pushing out till \u201822 on their own implementation of CECL accounting in the supervisory stress test. I was just wondering, just any takeaways you had from reading that and any hopes you might have for just as we get toward some finalization of which way CECL goes and how it looks, aspirations around that and how that interacts with CCAR and such?","Jamie Dimon","Before Marianne answers that question, I just want to do a shout out to Jefferies because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group, and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year.","Ken Usdin","I\u2019ll pass that along, Jamie.","Marianne Lake","Following that -- it\u2019s hard to follow, I would say that we've been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around CECL was properly understanding not just for us but regulators to properly understand the implications for capital, not only in benign but in stressed scenarios, and what the implications of the outcomes that it could have on the willingness of people to extend credit, particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase. So, having a transition is obviously helpful. You should imagine that we would likely avail ourselves of that opportunity. That is what it is. For me, the question that needs to be clarified is if we are to include the impact of CECL in company run stress test, but the Federal Reserve is not going to include it in the stress test, we need to kind of understand the insight between those two things, particularly if that might coincide with a turn in the cycle in actual fact.","So, I think we're looking for continued clarity from the regulators about what exactly that means. If we're embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are, how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks. And you know importantly if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans I do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics, secular change, that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential business. And we should worry about that.","Jamie Dimon","It'll be a big number for like credit card. So, if you put 3% now on when you build the loan book by $100, the number would be 6%. Some number in the future will be much higher. So, I do think particularly smaller banks will react fairly dramatically how they run their loan books through that.","Marianne Lake","So, our view is that more on that needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like. I hope that what was meant by we should include it in company run stress test is for us to collectively learn and for the regulators to have the time to respond to that. But remember, 2022, considering all the discussion we've had on this call about the cycle, how long the cycle is, when there's a turn in the cycle, and we could actually face a stress before that. And so it's great that they are waiting a bit, but it might all be a bit of an academic point depending on what happens actually.","Ken Usdin","Yes. That's a fair point. And Jamie you've also said in the past that you guys lend on accounting -- don't lend on accounting and lend on economic, but there's this kind of challenge to that that Marianne just mentioned about the unintended consequences. And so, it would be interesting to see that if there is in fact the point where banks don't lean in as you just mentioned, Marianne.","Jamie Dimon","They will change.","Marianne Lake","Yes. And we have the luxury or the flexibility of being able to say that we can continue to lend based upon the underlying economics but someone who has a differently situated balance sheet and return profile may not be able to do that.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","A follow-up on the net interest margin, two sides to the question, one is commercial loan pricing. I guess, it's been kind of brutal you\u2019ve had the BDCs, private equity firms, loan funds all computing. Has there been any let up with some of the dislocation the capital markets late in the year. And the other side, retail deposit betas, Marianne, you thought they would get a lot worse. I don't think it's been as bad as you thought. What was your retail deposit beta and what do you still expect?","Jamie Dimon","Before Marianne answers that can I just go back to the cyclical stuff? It's not just CECL a lot of things that have been built and since the crisis were really good, there was more pro-cyclicality built into it. And so you're going to see the next downturn that we have a far more pro-cyclical accounting, liquidity and rules, and rules capital and stuff like that, which we don't know the full effect of that. But if I was a regulator, I would be very cautious about constantly building pro-cyclicality into the system. And I gave you the example, it's our loan books, they're going from 7 to 30 or whatever they went to back to 14. It will affect how people respond to in the downturns. And it will cause people to pullback much quicker than maybe in the past in total.","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, just on your question, so corporate loan spreads, I would say, we did see sort of pretty brutal grinding down in corporate spread. But over the last actually couple of quarters, we saw them find a bit of an equilibrium and stabilize at levels. So, while, I would say it\u2019s still true to say that there is a lot of competition, at least in the space in which we\u2019re operating we\u2019re seeing spread at relatively stable levels in the corporate space. And honestly I don\u2019t remember saying that I thought we would see an acceleration that was dramatic in retail betas in the short-term. Obviously at some point when the when we have this level of rates and the spread between market rates and rates paid get to a certain level and if normalization continues, we would expect to see repo flags catch up. But, we have not seen that yet outside of CDs in retail phase right now.","Mike Mayo","And the way you calculate it, what was your retail deposit beta this quarter and how does that compare to the past?","Marianne Lake","So, in checking and savings and lead savings, it\u2019s nothing. In CDs, it\u2019s something but around to a very small number.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy ","Just a quick follow-up, Marianne. Have your investment bankers on the front lines passed on any concerns about the government shutdown? There is reports that the SEC is not open. And is that slowing down the investment banking business and your thoughts on that?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say that we\u2019ve been -- we benefited from the fact that year-end and into the early part of January and holiday season have a light calendar, typically in January for IPOs in particular. But for sure, if we don\u2019t see the ability to get approvals from SEC on IPOs and to a lesser extent some of the M&A deals that need approvals from government agencies, it will be problematic in the ability to see those activity levels play out and fees be realized. So, it\u2019s one of many things that would behoove us to end this sooner rather than later.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Jamie Dimon","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m going to take you through the earning presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page one, the firm reported record net income of $9.2 billion and EPS of $2.65 and record revenue of nearly $30 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19%. The results this quarter was strong and broad-based. ","The highlights include core loan growth ex-CIB at 5%, with loan trends continuing to progress as expected. Credit performance remained strong across businesses. We saw record client investment asset in consumer of over $300 billion and record new money flows this quarter, and double digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes, up 10% and 13% respectively. ","We ranked number one in Global IB fees and gained meaningful share, which are well above 9% this quarter. ","In the commercial bank we had record growth IB revenue, in asset and wealth management record AUM and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage. ","Turning to page, two and talking into more detail about the third quarter, revenue of $29.9 billion was up $1.3 billion or 5% year-on-year, driven by net interest income which was up $1.1 billion or 8% on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix. ","Non-interest revenue was up slightly as reported, but excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year, NII would have been up 5%, reflecting auto lease growth and strong investment banking fees and while market revenue was lower, there were other items more than offsetting.","Expense of $16.4 billion was up 2% relating to continued investments we are making in technology, real-estate, marketing and front office, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC fee charges of a little over $200 million. ","Credit remained favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up $330 million year-on-year driven by changes in wholesale reserves. In Consumer charge-offs were in line with expectations and there were no changes to reserves this quarter.","In Wholesale, we had about a $180 million of credit costs, driven by reserve sales on select C&I client downgrades and recall that there was a net release last year related to energy. Once again these downgrades were idiosyncratic. It was a handful of names and across sectors. Net reserve sales of this order of magnitude are extremely modest given the size of our portfolio and we are not seeing signs of deterioration. ","Moving on to page three, and balance sheet and capitals. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.1%, up modestly from last quarter, with a benefit of strong earnings and the AOCI gains given rallying rates being partially offset by slightly higher risk-weighted assets. ","RWA is up primarily due to high accounts cost of credit on trading activity, but notably this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis. ","Quarter-on-quarter loans were down in Home Lending as a result of a loan sale transaction in the CIB as a result of a large syndication and in Card and Asset & Wealth Management seasoning. ","Also in the page total assets are up over $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, basically driven by higher CIB trading assets in part and normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions. Lower end of period loans are partially offset by treasury balances, including higher security. In the quarter the firm distributed $7.4 billion of canceled shareholders, including $4.7 billion of share repurchases, and our pre-submitted our 2019 CCAR capital plan for the Federal Reserves. ","Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on page four, CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30%, with consumers remaining strong and confident. Core loans were up 4% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending and Products both up 6% and business banking up 3%. Deposits grew 3%, in line with our expectation and we believe we continue to outperform. ","Client investment assets were up 13% driven by record new money flows reflecting both across physical and digital channels including new invest. We also announced plans to open 90 branches this year in new markets. ","Revenues of $13.8 billion was up 9%; Consumer & Business Banking revenue up 15% on higher deposit NII driven by continued margin expansion; Home Lending revenue was down 11%, driven by net serving revenue on both lower operating revenue and MSR, but notably while volumes are down production revenue is up nicely year-on-year on disciplined pricing. ","And product Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 9% driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes. Expense of $7.2 billion was up 4%, driven by investments in the business and also lease depreciation, partly offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.","On Credit, net charge-offs were flat as lower charge-offs in Home Lending and Auto were offset by higher charge-offs in Card on loan growth. Charge-off rates were down year-on-year across lending portfolios.","Now turning to page five under Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion and an ROE of 16% on strong revenue performance of nearly $10 billion. For the quarter IB revenues of $1.7 billion was up 10% year-on-year and outside of an accounting nuance, all of advisory, DTM and total IB fees would have been record for our first quarter. ","Advisory fees were up 12% in a market that was down, benefiting from a number of larger deals closing this quarter. We ranked Number one in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly a 100 basis points of wallet share. ","Debt underwriting fees were up 21%, also outperforming a market that was down, driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead-left positions in leverage finance. We maintained our number one rank and gained well over 100 basis points of share. ","And Equity underwriting fees were down 23%, but in the market down more as a combination of the government shutdown, uncertainty around Brexit and residual impact from December volatility weighed on issuance activity across the regions in the first quarter. But already in the second quarter we\u2019ve seen a major recovery in US IPO volumes back to normalized levels and we are benefiting from our leadership in the technology and Healthcare sectors which again dominate the calendar.","Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.5 billion, down 17% reported was down 10% adjusted to the impact of the accounting standards last year that I referred to. Big picture, on a year-on-year we basis we are challenged by a tough comparison. Backlog in the first quarter of \u201818 was reported, clients were active and we saw broad based strength in performance which a clear record in equity last year. ","In contrast this quarter started relatively slowly and overhanging uncertainties kept flying from the slide lines despite and recovered in more favorable environments. ","And with that in mind I would characterize the results are solid and a little better than we thought at Investor Day just a few weeks ago, largely due to a better second half of March. And for what it\u2019s worth so far, the environment in April, sales general constructed but it\u2019s too early to draw any conclusion in terms of P&L. ","Fixed income markets revenue was down 8% adjusted, driven by lower activity, particularly in rates and in current fees and emerging markets, which normalized following a strong prior year. However we did see relative strengths in credit trading and strong flow, as well as in commodity. ","Equities revenue was down 13% adjusted, seeking more to the record prior year quarter and this quarter\u2019s performance, which was still generally strong across products. Although it got off to a somewhat slower start, cash in particular nearly matched last year\u2019s exceptional results. ","Treasury services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, benefitting from higher balances and payments volume, being partially offset by deposit margin compression. Security services revenue was a $1 billion, down 4% as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression, lower market levels and the impact of the business exist. Of note, deposit margin in both treasury services and security services is impacted by funding basis compression rather than client basis and at the firm wide level there is an offset. ","Finally, expense of $5.5 billion was down 4% driven by lower performance based compensation and lower FDIC charges, partially offset by continued investments in the business. The comps and revenue ratio for the quarter was 30%.","Moving to commercial banking on page 6. A strong quarter for the commercial bank with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year on strong investment banking performance and higher deposit NII. Record Gross IB revenue of over $800 million was up more than 40% year-on-year due to several large transactions, and the pipeline continues to stay robust and active. ","Deposit balances were down 5% year-on-year and 1% sequentially, as migration of non-operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives has decelerated and we believe it\u2019s largely behind us. From here we expect deposits to stabilize given the benign rate outlook. Expense of $873 million was up 3% year-on-year as we continue to invest in the business and the banker coverage and in technology.","Loans were up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 2% or up 5% adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax exempt portfolio. We continue to see solid growth across expansion market and specialized industries. CRE loans were up 1% as competition remained elevated and we continued to maintained discipline given where we are in the cycle. Finally credit costs of $90 million was predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge offs were only 2 basis points on strong underline performance.","Before we go on, I want to address the perceived seat gap between our reported C&I growth statistics and those that we all see in the fed weekly data. If we look across all of our hotel business, we also show strong growth year-on-year at about 8%, but there are three comments I would make; the first is that there can be reasonable noise in the fed weekly data; second, CIB is a big contributor for us, and CIB loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans. And third, as previously noted, the definition of C&I for the Feds does not include our tax reform portfolio, which has seen significant year-on-year declines given tax reforms. ","So while it\u2019s true that the Fed base was showing strong growth year-on-year and apples-to-apples ROE, in the domain stream middle market lending phase we are seeing good, mid-single digit demand in line with our expectation. ","Moving on to assets and Wealth Management on page seven. Assets and Wealth Management reported net income of $661 million with a pretax margin of 24% and an ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as lower management fees on average market levels, as well as lower growth brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains. ","Expense of $2.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year but continued investment in our business, as well other headcount related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees. For the quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $10 billion with strength in fixed income, partially offset by outflows from other asset classes. Additionally we have net liquidity outflows of $5 billion. ","AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both records of 4% driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long term products and with third quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines. ","Deposits were up 4% sequentially on seasonality and down 4% year-on-year, reflecting continued migration into investments, although decelerating as we continue to capture the vast majority of inflows. Finally we had record loan balances up 10% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending.","Moving to page eight in corporate. Corporate reported a net income of $251 million with net revenue of $425 million, compared to a net loss of over $200 million last year. The increase was driven by higher NII on higher rates, as well as cash deploying opportunities in the treasury. And recall last year we had nearly $250 million of net losses on security sales relative to a small net gain this quarter. Expenses of $211 million is up year-on-year and includes the contributions to the foundation of $100 million this quarter. ","Concluding on page nine, to wrap up this is a sort of quarter that really showcases the strengths of the firms operating model, benefiting from diversification and scale and our consistent investment agenda. We delivered record revenue and net income in a clean first quarter performance despite some hangover from the fourth quarter. ","Underlying drives across our businesses continue to propel us forward and in March and coming into April the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructed, client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum. ","Deposits grew is only six weeks behind us, so our guidance for the full hasn\u2019t changed. We do remain well positioned and optimistic about the firm\u2019s performance. ","With that operator, we\u2019ll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from a line of John McDonald with Autonomous.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Marianne you had good expense control this quarter and your Jamie's letter you show goals of improving the efficiency ratio on each of the main business units for the next few years. Just kind of wondering what's driving that? Is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that's going to occur in 2020 or is this just kind of positive operating leverage carrying through.","Marianne Lake","Hey John. So I would say just big picture it\u2019s a combination of both obviously. We told at Investor Day about the fact that you know we're always going to make the net investment, the net incremental investment decision base based on its own merits, but in total with the amount we\u2019re spending now and the amount of dollars that rolled off every year that get repositioned for investment. ","We feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years and so that is positive. Obviously a lot of the investments that we've been making in technology you know are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation, but that also has to do with operating efficiency and we would also expect to start to see some of that drive, you know operating leverage. But it\u2019s also the case that we are looking for revenue growth, so it\u2019s a combination of both. ","John McDonald","Okay, and then just on the NII outlook, it's reassuring to be able to hold the Investor Day outlook of the $58 billion for this year even though your curves flattened, there was some concerns there. What are the dynamics that enable you to keep the guidance even with the change in curve that we are seeing? ","Marianne Lake","Yeah, so I mean the first I would say is that you know, we probably said it before and we\u2019ve seen these periods where you get kind of short term fluctuations in the curve is that, it\u2019s a big dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so. And so in the big picture we said, you know $58 billion plus. Yes, it\u2019s true that a persistence that the curve would have a small net drag on Carry and we are not immune to that. So there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that, if it is persistent at this level throughout the year, but you know we continue to grow our loans and our deposits and against that, there is a mixed bag of lower for longer. ","So while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates, we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on you know basis necessarily and while now longer and the rates maybe a net small drag in the short term on earnings, that\u2019s a credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient FED and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle. So net-net there are pluses and minuses. I would say there may be some pressure and as a results that if it\u2019s persistent, but its modest. ","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. ","Mike Mayo ","Hi! You mentioned consumer deposit growth is outperforming where you get average consumer deposits up over $20 billion year-over-year, so those are the numbers. I just \u2013 I was hoping for a little bit more on the why, and to what degree does that reflect your build out of branches, how is that deposit growth going, how much of this is related to digital banking and then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength, I know that came up during the CEO hearing, the IMS study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail? Thank. ","Marianne Lake","Yeah, so look I will say there\u2019s lots of different opportunities for people to get ensured deposits. So you know, we\u2019ll come back to the other point, but all of that plays a piece. So you record that we build a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets being California and Florida and Nevada and the like and so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we are definitely seeing you know some growth in deposits there. ","By also firmly believing we talked about it many, many times that we\u2019ve been investing you know consistently over the last decade in customer experience, customer satisfaction in our consumer bank is at an all-time high and continues to increase consecutively. Digital products, new products and services, value propositions to our customers, convenience, new market, all of which I think are you know increasingly important to our customers, as well as obviously you know not a number of other factors. ","So you know to me it\u2019s a combination of all of the above and less so you know at this point of perception of a flight to quality, the people have a lot of choices. ","Year-over-year I would say you know we are see deposit growth grow exactly in line with our expectations, but this year the slowdowns speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and are little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate-seeking alternatives. So customers are voting with their business, they are brining deposits to us and I think it speaks to a combination of the investments we are making and also including any branches. ","Mike Mayo ","So how much in that deposit growth is due to digital banking? Can you quantify that or give us a ballpark figure? ","Marianne Lake","Well I can tell you that \u2013 and so it\u2019s not just about deposit growth as well remember. It\u2019s also about investment assets and we talked about our digital offerings providing headwinds there. So I don\u2019t have a breakout for you; we can follow up. You know it deepens at our branch, both you know the reason why we continue to believe in a fiscal and digital you know combined channel presence, both are important, but we can get back too. ","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. ","Glenn Schorr ","Hi, thanks very much. On sec services I heard you loud and clear about the funding basis compression being part of the answer on rev\u2019s down. Could you talk about the business exit? I wasn't aware that and how big that is and then flip to the better side, you also did mention that organic growth. We haven\u2019t heard too much since the big trillion dollar win, but I know there is stuff going on underneath the covers. Talk about what type of business you are winning there? ","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So on the business aspect, this is you know \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a feature of always talking about year-over-year. To me this feels like really old news. It was a U.S broker-dealer exit that we talked about many quarters ago, but obviously we are still on a year-over-year basis for another couple of quarters going to see the impact of that on our revenues. It\u2019s about just over $20 million year on year revenues negative impact, but it's you know relatively speaking old news in terms of the exit that took place last year. ","Lower market levels were about an equivalent drag on the revenues. And then we are seeing solid underlying growth, but this is a very competitive environment and as we are growing our asset from \u2013 you know our custody asset and as we are growing and winning new mandate, these are under competitive pressures and it also depends on mix. And so there is a bunch of factors going on. ","What we are focused on is so both of these businesses that the long term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth and the underlying businesses are performing well, and even with these revenue pressures we are focuses on continuing to drive efficiencies and these are good ROE businesses, you know above mid-teens. ","I\u2019m sorry, can I just make one more comment? I didn\u2019t say this on the digital space, but you know I think it\u2019s important as we think going forward that you know as we think not just about our digital assets, the digital account openings and that is being a feature of how we are attracting new accounts 25% of checking production, 40% of savings production, now able to be open digitally. So increasingly digital will be a driver, but we will get back to you with that. ","Glenn Schorr ","Marianne, just one quick qualifier on the seven hour marathon the other day in DC. Besides finding out Jamie's a capitalist, that\u2019s shocking news, one of the risks that I think that the group talked about was in the private credit markets and non-bank lending and I just wanted to get a little qualifier of that \u2013 I'm pretty sure you didn't mean the exposure JP Morgan has to those, it\u2019s just more risk being taken, but if you can just expand on that, that would be helpful. ","Marianne Lake","Yeah and for sure, the comment is more about the overall risk in the environment and not about our risk to you know those sectors and our risks are all the things that we\u2019ve always told you about which are relatively modest, relatively senior, well secured, well diversified. We look at you know losses under a variety of such scenarios are manageable.","The comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market, and while you know we wouldn't say necessarily that that's systemic, being not systemic and suggesting that there won't be problems are two different things. Not all non-banks are situated similarly, so there are some healthy fighting, well-capitalized, well and responsibly run companies, and there are some others who may not be standing at the end of another downturn.","So the real question for all of this business that has migrated outside of banks, is you know how much of it will be unable to be rolled over, refinanced on the same terms and with the same prices as it is now? So it's not about us, but it's about understanding that we would want to be able to be there to support and intermediate within these markets going forward. But for a variety of reasons whether it's structured, whether it's capital liquidity pricing, that may not be as easy as it sounds in a downturn for portions of that market.","Jamie Dimon","Yeah, so can I just take the big numbers, put those rolling, so obviously regulators keep an eye on it, and we are not particularly worried about it, but just to give you some facts. The banks \u2013 there\u2019s a $2.3 trillion. The banks have generally the senior piece or the A piece of about $800 billion or $900 billion. ","Then institutional investors, some of them are quite right. You know these are life insurance companies, funds, etcetera, owned BPs about $900 billion, and there's $500 billion what they call direct, and think of these as large funds. For the most part large funds, some are very capable, very bright, they have long-term capital. ","In the institutional piece that I mentioned, a lot of them are CLOs. I know that people are worried about that, but if you actually look at the CLOs, there\u2019s more equity in those CLOs, they are more funded and both the direct piece and the CLO piece is more capital, permanent capital, so the system is okay. It's just getting bigger as more outside and regulated judgment. It should be something that should be watched, but it's not a systemic issue at this point.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","I had a question for Jamie. Jamie, in the shareholder letter, you mentioned because of some significant issues around mortgage that you are intensely reviewing your role in origination servicing and holding mortgages, and the odds are increasing that we will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going forward. Could you give us some color and context for that statement and what kind of things you're thinking about there?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah. So if you look at the business, I mean it is just costly. You have 3,000 federal and state origination and servicing requirements; it is litigious. Just look at history, you can see that, and it's becoming a huge -- non-banks are becoming competitors, and they don't have the same regulations, the same requirements in the servicing or production. So you're having that issue of servicing itself is a hard asset. ","So we just, we just want to \u2013 we know it\u2019s an important thing for a bank. We also want \u2013 and also we standardized capital since a lot of banks are constrained by generalized capital; it's just a capital pod. Far more than it should be, if you look at it relative to the real risk embedded in holding mortgages. ","So we just want to have our eyes open, look at that, go through every piece, and structure it in a way that we're very happy going forward. We don't mind the volatility; we don't mind staying in the business, but you got to look at that and ask a lot of questions about whether banks should even be in it.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then, separate topic, but just a question I wanted to ask because I got a couple of questions on it yesterday. The whole group of CEOs was asked, who do you think could succeed you? Would a woman or would a person of color succeed you? And I don't think you raised your hand. I just wanted to understand why and just hear from you, you know why you answered the question that way?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah. So what I should have said is that we don't comment on or speculation on succession plan. That's a Board level issue. It's not something you do in Congress, where you play your hand out in Congress. But also I was confused by the question likely without a timetable. So we have exceptional women, and my successor may very well be a woman or it may not and it really depends on the circumstance of time, and it might be different if it's one year from now versus five years from now, so that's all that was. ","I think a bunch of people were kind of confused and saying what you would likely mean was stuff like that. So I mean still go and work in other several people on the operating committee who can succeed me.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks, I appreciate that. That's the answer I expected you we're going to give, but wanted to hear it from you, so I appreciate that. Thanks.","Jamie Dimon","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on the remarks on the mortgage business. We did see a healthy decline in resi mortgage loans and Marianne, I know you spoke at Investor Day of the balance sheet optimization strategy which could drive more growth in securities versus loans. I'm wondering, is that what's really driving the slowdown that we saw in resi loan growth and maybe more broadly how we should think about core loan growth or a sustainable pace of core loan growth in 2019?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So mortgages in 2018-2019 are the epicenter of it, for mortgage. So the market itself is more year-on-year. It's about 15% smaller, because notwithstanding all of the discussion about lower rates and still higher year-on-year than they were this time last year. So that obviously is having an impact and as we've been -- and we're down similarly. ","So we've added about $6 billion of core mortgage loans to our portfolios. But against that, as you saw last year, we did a number of loan sales and we did another sale again in the first quarter and that speaks to optimizing the balance sheet. We're trying to take loans off of our balance sheet, core loans of our balance sheet, and sell them if we can reinvest in agency MBS and non-resi assets that has better capital liquidity characteristics. ","So it's going to be a little bit harder to look at the trend. You're going to need to look at things grow. So we are originating high quality loans. We are adding a number of loans to our portfolio; we're distributing based on better execution as that would go, but we will continue to optimize our balance sheet.","Steven Chubak","Very helpful, and just a follow-up for me on CCAR. The Fed released a document recently highlighting the changes to the loss models this year, including some higher Card and Auto losses in the upcoming exam. I'm just wondering, how does that inform the way you're thinking about capital return capacity. And are you still confident in that sustainability of 75% to 100% net payout as well as the 11% to 12% CET1 target?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So I didn't hear the second part of the question on losses, which losses were up this year that you were mentioning, but here is what I would say.","Steven Chubak","The Card and Auto losses.","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So I applaud transparency for sure and we love to be able to get more detail as we think about the way that the Fed model losses for our portfolios. And we've been observing that over time. Necessarily, it's the case that the Federal Reserve models are typically less granular and less tied to our specific risks necessarily, because they are industry wide. ","Net-net, it doesn't change our point of view that as we're at 12.1% CET1 right now, so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings, but we always invest in our businesses first.","So, we are growing our businesses responsibly. Every time we're adding branches, we're adding customers, we're adding advisors across our businesses. But to the degree that we have excess earnings, we'll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of February, nothing changed.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi. Good morning, Marianne. A quick question \u2013 I know you mentioned that the increase in NPLs within Wholesale was again idiosyncratic, but last quarter there was also an increase and it was five credits last quarter. Is there a way you can give more color as to the specific drivers in there? I know you said in the past that you expect to normalize that you're off a low base. I got that, but I mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So, the color is there is really no color, which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last eight quarters and take oil, gas, energy releases out, you would've seen you know quarters where reserve builds were close to home and other quarters where there are $100 million in between. So there's always been the propensity for there to be one or two or three or four downgrades. ","The thing we look for is whether or not as we look at the portfolio of facilities we have, whether we're seeing pressure on corporate margins and free cash flow, and whether we're seeing that broadly across the sectors and companies we're banking and we're just not.","So, it's not to say that we aren't playing close attention to real estate given where we are in the cycle \u2013 it's not to say, we're playing close attention to retail, but the color is there is no real color that these are genuinely a handful of names across a handful of sectors as was true last quarter. And even if you look quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter there's no trend to call out and we have a large wholesale lending portfolio. These are extremely modest in the context of that.","And remember every quarter, like we talk about a few, because it's non-zero, but we downgrade and upgrade hundreds of facilities every quarter, and it's not just downgrades, it's upgrades, and they are approximately of equal measure. So we're looking very carefully at it. I think we understand why people are questioning, concerned, and these are cyclical businesses and the cycle will turn, but we're not seeing it yet.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then a separate question in the mortgage banking; it looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point as over the last five years this quarter. Was that something in the market? Something with the rates or was there a one-off impacting that number this quarter?","Marianne Lake","So, you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized -- and as geography. In the Home Lending business when we do these mortgage loan sales because we're match funded, net-net there's very little P&L. But last quarter, there was a loss in NIR and an offset in rate funding in NIR, this quarter there's a gain. ","So you've got a loss quarter, gain this quarter, both small, but nevertheless that's driving the majority of the production margin going up. But in addition, if you just strip all that noise out, which is not material, but nevertheless significant quarter-over-quarter, we are seeing better revenue margins on better pricing.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Marianne.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us -- obviously you've got your de novo branching strategy moving forward. And what have you guys discovered and how long does it take for the branches to reach breakeven and then eventually get to your desired return on investment numbers?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So we're really, really excited to be able to open these branches in these markets and serve more customers across the United States. But when you talk about branches, you are talking about investment for the long-term, and when I say long-term, multiple years, decades. So with respect to the new markets that we're entering, these are extremely nascent investments, the branches, in many cases we haven't even broken ground on. ","However that said, early indications, very, very early indications are strongly positive. We're seeing a lot of excitement in the market. We're seeing new accounts in production, a little better than we would have expected at this very early stage. ","On the whole, you see branches break even over several years and mature in terms of deposit and investments and relationships closer to 10 years or below that.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good, and then following up on some comments you made at Investor Day, and I believe touched on today about technology spending. If I recall correctly, next year technology spending should be self-funding and stabilized at just about where you are today. When you compare it to the past five years, what has changed with the growth trajectory of technology? Nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years?","Marianne Lake","So, I just want to reiterate something that I want to make sure you guys completely internalize, which is we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we're getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they have in the past, but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit. ","With that said, we've been growing our technology spend, and in particular we've been growing the portion of it that is invested in changing the bank. And that runs the gamut from platform modernization and cloud to controls and security and customer experience and digital, R&D and the whole lot.","It's a large number, and each year a lot of the dollars that we've been investing roll off and we get the ability to redecision and reinvest them. So, this is not that we're going to be doing anything other than continuing to invest very, very heavily in the agenda, and in particular in the technology agenda. It's just that each year [Audio Gap] and we'll continue to make the right decisions, and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you.","Marianne Lake","And we're getting more efficient. So in the past the way the technology was delivered was very different, and the more that we're in, our modern virtualized cloud-ready way with new technology, each dollar of technology is more productive.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.","Alevizos Alevizakos","Hi. I've got a quick question and a follow-up basically. My question is on the Treasury Services, year-on-year the growth going from double-digit you just grow to 3% where apparently the volumes remained healthy, but the margins started to deteriorate. I wonder how you feel going into the remaining of 2019, especially given that the trade talks are still ongoing and therefore volumes could actually be a bit more problematic. Do you still believe that we can go back to kind of double-digit growth year-on-year for the remaining quarters? ","And my follow-up question is, we talked about change the bank versus run the bank for IT budget. Can you give us a number just to get the indication of how much you're spending on innovation? Thank you.","Marianne Lake","Yes. Okay, so first point on Treasury Services last year revenue growth was in double digits. You're right, this quarter fixed on year-on-year. I mentioned earlier that for both of our wholesale businesses we happen to have basis compression between the funding spreads that we provide to the businesses and pricing declines and so that is just given where rates have moved maybe a headwind this year as the segment results are reported, but for the company it's obviously net zero.","The more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue. So you will see margins really compressed on that. It's not speaking to deposit flows, it's not speaking to volumes and it's not speaking to escalating payouts at this point. So we feel good about the underlying organic growth in the business.","With respect to technology spend, you'll recall last year we were kind of 60-40 run the bank, change the bank, and it's more 50-50 this year, so $11.5 billion of spend about half and half.","Alevizos Alevizakos","Thank you very much.","Marianne Lake","Remember, in the change of the bank it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience, digital, data, R&D, so it's the whole spectrum.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the net interest income, and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter. Is there anything that's lumpy or one-time that you'd flag? Because if you annualize it, you're already above the full year target of $58 billion plus and obviously there's day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth, but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you're at right now.","Marianne Lake","Okay, so we did slightly better in the first quarter, two things driving it. One is small but nevertheless is arguably non-recurring, which is we talked about the fact that overall in the company when we do these loan sales, that net-net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in Treasury and it was a small gain in the first quarter in NII, call it $50 million approximately.","And then in addition we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that was high-yielding than IOER, that continued into the first quarter. So we did benefit from that and it may or may not continue, but we're not necessarily expecting that to continue all the way through. ","So I would say that day count was a drag. As you look forward with some opportunities, honestly obviously I do see that there is a risk associated with the flat yield curve, not big, but nevertheless net neutral to downward pressure or downward pressure, its long end rates stay lower for longer. ","As we don't have the tailwind anymore from higher rates and we continue to process the December rate hike, you could see more rates paid to a little bit more into second quarter, so there are risks and opportunities. We still think it's a decent outlook, but I don't think it's conservative. I think its -- $58 billion is straight down the middle at this point. The trouble with the yield curve is it can fluctuate dramatically over the short-term and we shouldn't over-interpret or over chase it. At this point I think it's a decent estimate and we'll continue to update you.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then just on the repositioning of the balance sheet and the approach to adding securities. Are you thinking any differently going forward than maybe you were six weeks ago? You clearly seem more positive on the macro and obviously things can change there, but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently, given may be more positive macro outlook?","Marianne Lake","Well, I mean we only spoke to you most recently about six weeks ago. So, the sort of overall answer is, no, not really. We expected at that point that we would have a patient fed. It turns out that all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish, which couldn't generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk on the balance sheet.","Obviously the curve being flatter is not sort of a compelling situation to add more duration, but there's natural drift in our balance sheet there. So overall very little, we feel good about the credit. The curve is flat and we'll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Yes, hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up, Marianne on the comments. In the backdrop for lower rates for longer, could you give us a sense on how you're thinking about your deposit strategy in retail and wholesale? In other words, I know you discussed some dynamics on pricing for the first quarter, but when do you expect competition to taper off and do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time?","Marianne Lake","So, I'll just put the big contextual answer will always be the same, which is when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing, it is 100% driven by what we're observing and our consumer behavior than what we're seeing in deposit flows. And so that's the environment that we look at to determine what's happening, and you know you've seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we've seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives, whether it's investments or whether it's more recently in CDs, and that may continue; we'll continue to watch that. ","It is our expectation that rates will be relatively stable from here in terms of the short end, and it's the short end that predominantly drives the sort of deposit pricing agenda. So even if the curve is flatter, as long as it's because the front end is stable, I don't necessarily see deposit costs going down, but we're going to continue to watch our customer behaviors and deposit flows and respond accordingly.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And my follow-up question is, we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale non-accruals was idiosyncratic, and I'm wondering as we look at a tick-up in non-accrual loans in the Corporate & Investment Bank for the past two quarters, are we just in the part of the cycle where we're just growing from a low base or should we expect a step-down in the second quarter in non-accruals similar to how we saw last year?","Marianne Lake","There are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter, but I would say it's a feature more of extremely low base and so from that any movement whether they are up or down, it's somewhat exaggerated. But we would continue to call the credit environment benign.","Erika Najarian","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Marianne just if I could ask you, you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening, and I wanted to just ask you to \u2013 can you split that between just what you're seeing on the consumer side versus the wholesale corporate side in terms of, the spend numbers are obviously still double-digit year-over-year, some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown, you are just still saying quite good. And then there is this unevenness about just CapEx and spending and corporate side. So just could you just kind of walk us through just where you're seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement?","Marianne Lake","Yeah, I mean I think that as it relates to U.S. and in particular looking at the U.S. consumer, you've got all of jobs more recently, Auto, Housing, spend, all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust and whether it's double-digits or whether it's not, we're continuing to see that - and can see the confidence by the way, which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangout from the equity market actions over the four quarters. ","So for us, U.S. Consumer has always been strong and confident and even if we're not all-time high and confidence is still very high, and generally the beta is - and even some like housing and also that hasn't necessarily been super strong, is looking encouraging.","And then on the global front, it is a little harder, but as you look at some of the areas that have been struggling a bit, and Europe would be a good example, we would think that in the first quarter sort of transitory factors around social unrest and politics in Brexit, and they seem to be fading a little, business confidence has recovered a little, businesses are still spending on labor, so generally a good side of the underlying confidence notwithstanding any kind of sentiment numbers. ","And even there there's job growth, there's wage growth you know helped by dovish monetary policy and general financial conditions having increase and eased. So, I think, generally we feel optimistic across the Consumer and the rest of the sector, albeit it's sort of green shoots on the wholesale buy. So, t's early, but it's what we were expecting to see and so it will continue.","Ken Usdin","Yeah, and one follow-up just on Investment Banking business. You had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we've seen the reopening of the ECM market. Your general outlook just again on that global point about the, bit unevenness between US and global. Just how do you feel about the advisory backdrop and obviously some big deals on the tape again today? But had it been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter, but how is that side of the business you're feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So, I would say that a couple of things. Obviously there were some deals that moved into the first quarter out of the second half of 2018 and so we did benefit from that.","But just as a general market matter, M&A is still attractive in a low growth environment, albeit a growth environment, investors are still constructive. North America, which is by far the biggest market for M&A is still healthy and so, Europe was a big driver last year and Europe has been a sharp drop off in volumes and wallet and so that may continue, although we have a pretty good position there. So I would say that the pipeline is down, but still M&A is attractive and people are looking for synergistic growth.","Ken Usdin","That makes sense. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell ","Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on the NII outlook. I mean I think we've talked about a flat curve. What kind of levers do you have to pull if we were to see what some are speculating. It doesn't sound like you're in that camp, but if you were to get a rate cut, how do you manage that? How do you think the balance sheet reacts and NII reacts to a potential for rate cut over the next 12 months?","Marianne Lake","Right. So the market which is usually more, you know I would say pessimistic, but more in that camp, they are still only expecting and ease at the end of the year, so we are not by the way as you point out. So, I think for 2019's NII outlook, it's not a clear and present danger and there will be a need. ","Obviously we have on the way up on rates been over-indexed to total end rates and so clearly if we were to have any, it would have an impact on our NII. If we felt generally that that was the direction that the economy and rates were going in, then it might change our view on how we position the balance sheet. But right now, the fed is on course. Right now that's constructive for corporate deposit margins, constructive for credit, and generally constructive for how we're positioned on the balance sheet.","Jim Mitchell ","It's still you like you have room to, I guess, extend duration to kind of protect NII and NIM if that would happen?","Marianne Lake","Yes, yes, we do.","Jim Mitchell ","Okay. Alright, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez ","Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Matt's question on sort of idiosyncratic items in the quarter and lumpiness. This is obviously a pretty strong quarter from an earnings standpoint, earnings well ahead of my estimates and consensus, especially in CCB, but there weren't a lot of obvious non-core items really called out. ","So Marianne, can you just comment on the sustainability of the results and whether there is some idiosyncratic things that weren't necessarily called out during the call. You mentioned corporate, cash deployment revenues really high relative to historical levels there. So are there any sort of idiosyncratic items that call in the question how sustainable the results are?","Marianne Lake","So first of all just sort of big pic, first of all really high I think is a bit of an overstatement \u2013 higher I think is fair. No, not really if there were, you know we would have called them out. There are a few little things, so I'm just going to call out a few of the things that we have mentioned. We contributed $100 million to the foundation this quarter. Net-net legal was a very, very small, but nevertheless positive this quarter, so there's a few little bits and pieces like that. ","But if you look at revenue performance, we did a little better across the board than you all were expecting. We did better in IBCs and we gained a lot of share; we did a little better in markets; we did a little better in NII, so we just got a little bit of a wind on our backs sort of phenomenon. ","Probably my best answer to you is, as happy as we are with the performance, and we are gaining share and continuing to see our underlying drivers propel us forward and the momentum we got in our businesses, we are not making material changes to our full year outlook. ","So we'll still see how markets performed for the year. We do still expect, as Dimon mentioned at Investor Day, that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter. Coalition is still expecting the wallet to be down between 5% and 10% year-on-year. So, we do expect to gain share to help offset that, but last year was a record. ","So we haven't changed our full year guidance at all yet. We'll take this as a very good down payment to that. And if markets are constructive and wallet expands we\u2019ll benefit from that, but\u2026","Saul Martinez ","Okay. No that's...","Marianne Lake","We're not leading it across and changing everything.","Saul Martinez ","That's helpful. I'll change gears a little bit. Any update on distressed capital buffer, what the fed is thinking there and when you think we could see a little bit more details or a little bit more clarity on the proposal?","Marianne Lake","So the best I know, there is a chance, but not necessarily a probability that there could be an SCB proposal for 2020 CCAR. So there's a set of meetings or a meeting that\u2019s coming up sometime in the summer that I think might be an important moment. But we continue to work as constructively as we can to help understand the better way to bridge growth capital together with point-in-time capital, but it's complicated. ","You know as we said the most important thing is not to issue an SCB proposal, it doesn't deal with the entire landscape of capital and look at it cohesively. So we're talking about GSIB, we're talking about minimums, we're talking about Basel, we're talking about SCB, it's complicated. I'd say there's a chance but not a probability that we might have something in time for 2020 CCAR.","Saul Martinez ","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, good morning. First I want to ask as going to CCAR, now we're getting into that season again, one of the things that I think has an impact is that, what we had was a significant 30% plus growth in earnings last year. So if you kind of look at the plan for your capital going forward, and you think of holding payout ratios so to say they were just constant, doesn't that kind of presume that you have kind of some wind behind the sales just to increase fairly significantly just off the increase in earnings last year?","Marianne Lake","I mean yes, yes. If you look at payout ratios, obviously it's sort of described as a percentage, then we said over the longer term, we'd expect to payout in a benign environment between 75% and 100%, and analysts have estimates of 90% plus. And obviously as earnings grow, that would be a bigger dollar number. ","But again, we'll always calibrate that relative to our opportunity to invest in our businesses and its capacity not a promise. So we'll continue to see how the whole environment unfolds. But you're right, as earnings continue to grow, a strong payout ratio, we're above the top end of our capital range. So we are starting at a robust level, would be a higher dollar number, yes.","Marty Mosby","And then, Jamie, I was just curious. I think one of the issues facing the industry, and just we get pushed from the outside is that the cycle is 10 years old and my thought is that that internal time clock is just off this time. And so if we look at it, I think there's things that you're seeing or Marianne that you see inside the company that probably dispel that the recession is kind of on the horizon. So just wanted to get your comment on that as well? That's my follow-up question. Thanks.","Marianne Lake","Yeah Marty, go ahead Jamie.","Jamie Dimon","Yes, some sort of number that's out that\u2019s there in Australia had growth for 28 years. And just so I'm saying in notional, but you have to have a recession. Now they've had a lot of back winds, there's growth in Asia and stuff like that. But if you look at the American economy, the consumer's in good shape, the balance sheet's in good shape, people are going back to the workforce. Companies have plenty of capital, and capital expenditure is still up year-over-year, little bit less this quarter than last quarter. ","Our capital is being retained in the United States. Business confidence and consumer confidence are both rather high and not all-time peaks, rather high. So you can just easily, it can go on for years. There's no law that says it has to stop. ","We do make a list, and look at all the other things, geopolitical issues, lower liquidity. So there may be a confluence of events that somehow caused the recession, but it may not be in 2019, 2020, 2021. Obviously at one point though there will probably be something, and yeah I think the bigger short-term risk would be something to go wrong in China, the trade issues in China. So, I just wouldn't account them to having to be a recession in the short run, couple of years.","Marty Mosby ","I agree, thanks.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","Andrew Lim ","Hi, morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on the end-of-period loans. So if we look across the board, it looks like there are some contraction there on a quarter-to-quarter basis of about 3% of 4%. And I was just wondering if you saw that as a one quarter issue relating to what happened in 4Q '18 and if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to company CEOs where you secrets reemerging again.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So quarter-on-quarter \u2013 and I think I mentioned a couple of these things, but across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end-of-period basis loans are down. So like stepping through them, the first one I would point out is mortgage, and we just talked about that I think earlier in the call, which is we continue to originate mortgage loans and continue to distribute them on portfolio. We did do a loan sale, which is part of the discussion that we've been having with you about optimizing our balance sheet. We did a sale at the end of the quarter, so that's impacting mortgage loans. ","In the CIB and one of the reasons why we call out core loan growth ex-CIB is because we don't consider CIB loans core, it\u2019s because they are just by their nature often times more episodic and lumpy, and so we did see a large funded syndicated loan at the end of last quarter which was fully syndicated into the first quarter.","And then, in our other businesses in Asset & Wealth Management, a bit of seasonality, a few pay-downs in Card seasonality. So it's just sort of combination of factors, but I would say two drivers, CIB and Home Lending, CIB on sort of a large syndication, Home Lending on the loan sale. ","Going forward we'll continue to optimize the loan versus security part of our balance sheet as best we can for cash and liquidity purposes. But just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending, you know I look at the middle-market space and say, we're still seeing solid demand. It is in our investment areas and our expansion markets and specialized industries that we're still growing that portion of our loans in the mid-single digits year-on-year.","Andrew Lim ","Yes. Great, thanks. So my following question is on.","Marianne Lake","Before you go into, there are going to be other areas where we just won't roll out. I mean in Commercial Real Estate, you see loan growth is much lower; it's very competitive; its prices have come down. We continue to provide financing and funding for our core loans, but we're not going to chase it down and similarly Auto.","Andrew Lim ","Sure. Okay, thanks. So my follow-on question is on CLOs. So as some Japanese institutions are big buyers of U.S. highly rated CLOs, but a few weeks ago the Japanese FSA introduced some new rules saying that there had to be 5% risk retention by U.S. issuers in order for the Japanese institutions to buy them. So I'm just wondering if you're seeing yet any change in demand from Japanese institutions and likewise on the other side if there is any change in behavior from U.S. CLO issuers in terms of trying to integrate 5% risk retention.","Marianne Lake","It\u2019s a great question. The answer I'm going to give you is not that I'm aware of at this time, but I'll have to follow up with you. Jamie are you aware? No? Sorry Andrew, we'll come back to you. Not that I'm aware of, but it is a good, but nevertheless quite detailed question.","Andrew Lim ","Okay, thanks.","Marianne Lake","Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Marianne Lake","Thank you everyone.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's call.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.4 billion and EPS of $2.34 on revenue of $27.8 billion with the return on tangible common equity of 17%. The result this quarter was strong. Record net income for third quarter even excluding the impact of tax reform with key drivers being higher net interest income across businesses reflecting continued rate normalization and solid growth in both loans and deposits, as well as very strong credit performance across all portfolios.","Highlights include, average core loan growth excluding the CIB up 6% year-on-year, card and debit sales as well as client investment assets and merchant processing volumes and consumer were all up double digits. We gained share in global IB fees and across all regions year-to-date and in Asset & Wealth Management, AUM and clients assets were both up 7%.","Turning to page 2 and some more detail about our third quarter results. Revenue of $27.8 billion was up $1.4 billion or 5% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $945 million or 7%, reflecting the impact of higher rate, net of lower market NII as well as loan and deposit growth.","Noninterest revenue was up $425 million driven by market NII and higher auto lease income, partially offset by markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments.","Expense of $15.6 billion was up 7% year-on-year. More than half of the increase relates to investments we\u2019re making in technology, marketing, bankers broadly defined and real estate. And the remainder is driven by revenue related costs, principally higher auto lease depreciation and transaction expenses on higher volumes.","Credit trends remained favorable across both consumer and wholesale. For the quarter, credit costs of $950 million were down $500 million year-on-year, driven by changes in consumer reserves.","Briefly on page 3, turning to balance sheet and capital. So, little to say here other than as you can see, capital and risk weighted assets remained basically flat quarter-on-quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12%.","Moving on to page four and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $4.1 billion of net income and an ROE of 31%. Core loans were up 6% year-on-year, driven by home lending up 10%, business banking up 5%, card up 4% and auto loans and leases up 3%.","Deposits grew 4% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the industry although slower than a year ago. According to the recently released FDIC annual survey, we grew at nearly 2 times the average and we were the fastest growing bank in 9 of our top 10 markets. Chase also earned the number one spot in customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study.","Client investment assets were up 14% as we saw clear record net new money flows, more than doubling year-on-year, with flows accounting for more than half of the growth. Card sales volume was up 12% with strength across our portfolio, and we also saw very strong debit sales performance, up 13%.","Revenue of $13.3 billion was up 10%. Consumer and business banking revenue up 18% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth. Home lending revenue was down 16% as higher rates drive loan spread compression and the smaller markets pressuring production margins. In addition, net servicing revenue was down including the MSR.","Card, merchant services, and auto revenue was up 10%, driven by higher card NII on margin expansion and loan growth, higher net card fees on lower acquisition costs predominately offset by lower net interchange and also on higher auto lease volumes. Expense of $7 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investments in technology and by auto lease depreciation. The overhead ratio was 53%.","Finally on credit, starting with reserves. This quarter, we built reserves in card of $150 million, largely driven by growth. And we released reserve in the home lending purchased credit-impaired portfolio of $250 million, reflecting improvements in home prices and delinquencies.","On charge-offs, there are few moving pieces. Year-on-year charge-offs were down $137 million, driven by a recovery from a reperforming loan sale in home lending this quarter of about $80 million, together with an approximately $50 million charge-off adjustment in auto this period last year.","Excluding those, charge-offs were about flat. But, we are seeing improvement across all portfolios except for card. And in card, while charge-offs are up as newer vintages season, they are up less than expected and credit performance remained very strong. At this point, we expect card charge-off rates for the year to be below our guidance at about 310 basis points.","Now turning to page five and the Corporate and Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.6 billion, and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $8.8 billion up 3%. In banking, we maintained our number one ranking year-to-date in global IB fees as well as in North America and EMEA, and gained share across regions. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was flat to a strong prior year and we outperformed in a market of sound meaningful as we saw robust activity, particularly in ECM. Equity underwriting fees were up 40%, gaining share across all products with continued strength in IPOs, particularly in technology and healthcare.","Advisory fees were down 6% compared to a third quarter record last year, outperforming the market and gaining share year-to-date. And debt underwriting fees were down 11% although better than the market, as our strong lead left positions drove share gains. Looking forward, the overall pipeline remains strong, up solidly from the prior year across products.","Moving to markets. Total revenue was $4.4 billion, down 2% or up 1% when adjusting for the impact of tax reform, so another good performance. Fixed income markets revenue was down 6% adjusted with no single predominant driver. We saw mild weakness in rates, financing, credit rating and securitized products as a result of compressed margins and tighter financing spreads in range-bound and competitive markets. This was partly offset by higher activity levels in emerging markets on volatility and commodities returning to more normal levels relative to a weaker prior year.","Equities continued the momentum from previous quarters and was up across all segments on the back of strong client activity. Equity revenue was up 17%, reflecting continued share gains in cash and prime and strong performance in corporate derivatives. Treasury services and securities services revenue were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, up 12% and 5% year-on-year respectively, driven by higher rates and balances. And securities services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity. Quarter-on-quarter, securities services revenue was down principally on seasonality and the impacts of the business exit.","Finally, expense of $5.2 billion was up 8%, driven by higher legal expense, higher compensation expense as we invest in technology and bankers, and volume related transaction costs.","Moving to commercial banking on page six. Another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII. Gross IB revenue of $581 million was flat, although we saw a strong underlying flow of business and pipelines remained robust and active.","On deposits, while we continue to benefit from the normalizing rate environment, as expected, balances are down year-on-year and bases are trending higher, as we are seeing some migration at the top end to higher yielding investments.","Expense of $853 million was up 7%, as we continue to invest in the business in banker coverage and technology initiatives. Loan balances were up 4% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. In C&I, demand remains muted in the wake of tax reform as well client confidence is high, balance sheet is strong and liquid, and the environment is competitive.","For us, C&I loans were up 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially, in line with the industry. But if you decompose it, we\u2019re growing strongly in our expansion markets and specialized industries, growing solidly in our core markets, but are seeing notable offset in tax expense activity, given the mix of our business.","CRE loans were up 3% year-on-year, a little less than the industry as we\u2019re seeing increased competition and continue to be very selective. Finally, credit performance remained strong with net recovery of 3 basis points.","Moving on to asset and wealth management on page seven. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $724 million with a pretax margin of 27% and an ROE of 31%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees, net of fee compression on higher market levels and continued growth in long-term products. These are partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains, including on seed capital investments.","Additionally, banking is also strong. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investments in advisors and technology, as well as high external fees on revenue growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $8 billion with positive flows across all asset classes. In addition, we saw net liquidity inflows of $14 billion. AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both up 7% with more than half of the increase being driven by flows and the remainder on higher market.","Deposits were down 8% year-on-year, reflecting migration into investments with us, and down 5% sequentially including seasonality. Finally, we had loan balances up 12% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending.","Moving to page eight and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $145 million. Treasury and CIO net income was up year-on-year, primarily driven by higher rates. Other corporate was a net loss of $241 million, including markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments of $220 million pretax. For the whole Company, legal costs were a modest negative, with the benefit here in other corporate being more than offset in the CIB.","Moving to page 9 and outlook. We recently gave you updated outlook, so unsurprisingly that still holds and it\u2019s here on the page. Only two things of note. Our expense outlook assumes that the FDIC surcharge ended this quarter. So, clearly an extension would pose a risk. And on tax, there are a number of questions in the rules, which we expect to be clarified by the end of the year. We will have to work through them but would not expect any changes to be material.","So to close. We are growing across most of our businesses. We\u2019re investing heavily in all of them. We\u2019re investing in technology, bankers and beyond. Credit is in great shape and the earnings power of the Company is evident. We are particularly proud of the strength and improvement in customer satisfaction broadly and our continued investments which drive leadership positions and market share gains. This quarter, we announced Sapphire Banking and our digital investing platform You Invest. We opened our first branch as part of our expansion strategy in Washington DC, announced additional expansion into Philadelphia and Boston, and also announced our AdvancingCities initiative as we invest for growth in the clients and communities that we serve.","With that, operator, please open the line to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. So, at the Investor Day, I remember asking you the same question. So, I apologize. But, you have talked about consumer and corporate balance sheets being in great shape and having low debt service burden. The 10-year is up a modest 35 basis points since then and the world is freaking out that it\u2019s the end of the cycle and that\u2019s going to choke off the recovery. Your results are your results but they\u2019re some will say backward looking. Are you seeing any impact, A, at the modest increase in the curve now? And B, I\u2019ll ask again, is there a level of rates where you would start to see an impact of slowdown in what you\u2019re willing to lend rising in credit costs, things like that? Thank you.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say -- I would sort of pick up on the tone that you had in your question, which is the level of rates is not surprisingly high. And so, from our vantage point we\u2019re not seeing anything in terms of looking at our current dialogue or for that matter at credit trends that would suggest that this is problematic. With higher rates and we do this all the time, we obviously look at all of our portfolio and stress them for shocks of up 100 basis points even up 200, although clearly where we are now, risks are more asymmetric but -- I mean more symmetric. But, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any extraordinary stress that becomes evident, even if you -- obviously, the margin you\u2019re going to get more but it doesn\u2019t seem to be overwhelming. And it speaks, I think to the fact that low rates have been around for long term -- time. People have had the chance to get prepared. There is a lot of liquidity. And in the corporate space in particular, people have been able to hedge. So, is there an absolute level of rates where things will be problematic? At some point, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near there. So, I\u2019m not saying that there couldn\u2019t be select downgrades; I\u2019m not saying that at the margin, there may not be some incremental stress if rates continue to go much higher, but that\u2019s not where we are right now.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thanks very much, Marianne.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research. ","Steve Chubak","So, I wanted to start with the question on the You Invest launch. As we think about the strategy for the business, I want to understand, is the goal to compete with the incumbents to win new clients or are you simply trying to augment the existing offerings for JPMorgan clients? And it\u2019s really just our effort to understand the long-term strategy, given that the pricing is quite competitive but at the same time, the marketing effort has been fairly minimal so far?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I mean, remember, You Invest, it\u2019s early. Jamie just said, I don\u2019t know if you heard it. Yes and yes. Clearly, we are trying to add products and capabilities and value to our existing clients in an effort to continue to drive loyalty and engagement, and also earn more share of their wallet. But, we do think that the proposition is compelling and that the pricing is disruptive. And we should also expect over time to be able to attract new accounts. So, yes and yes, but it\u2019s early days. We\u2019re going to continue to develop, You Invest, its capabilities to iterate it and improve it. So far, it\u2019s early but good.","Steve Chubak","And just one follow-up for me relating to the commentary on the deposit side. You spoke of some of the headwinds to the deposit growth and these are more industry trends, including yield-seeking behavior on both the commercial and asset management side. I know you\u2019ve given some helpful guidance in terms of the impact of Fed QE unwind as well, in the past. I\u2019m just wondering, is the yield seeking-behavior you\u2019ve seen so far consistent with your expectation, do you still expect to grow deposits as we look out for the next couple of years?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, the answer is generically yes, as we would have expected. Obviously, we have no crystal ball as to the sort of timing and parts of these things. But, it is paying out arguably little slower than we thought, but like we thought. And I would say that our outlook for deposit growth is -- for it to be slower, but still positive.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","So, first question just on the rate question that you got earlier. But, I wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the impact on the outlook for your asset yields, in particular the securities portfolio. I know you\u2019ve given guidance on that before, but given the sharp backup that we\u2019ve got over the last couple of weeks, how is that impacting your forward look on that?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I mean, on the asset side of the balance sheet just a big rule of thumb is that a little less than half of our loans are variable, index sort of prime and LIBOR. And so, what we\u2019ve been seeing -- in any one quarter, there can be noise on one time item mix or whatever else. But, largely speaking, for every rate hike we\u2019ve been seeing on the front end, we\u2019re seeing our assets reprice about half of that and that -- or loans be priced about half of that and that\u2019s what we\u2019d expect. Similarly, if we see sustained increases in the low end of the curve, then we would see that play through into our investment securities yield. Obviously, this quarter while there was a meaningful increase on a spot basis, on average basis that wasn\u2019t the case and particularly not for mortgages. So, it had a modest impact on investment security yields this quarter. But, again, if it was a sustained and more sizeable, we would see that play through yes -- or would rotate the assets into higher book yields over time.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then, my follow-up question has to do with a blockchain that you launched this quarter. I think, it was on September 25th, you launched a blockchain for international payments. And I know at Investor Day, you talked a lot about the investments you were making on that side. Should we be viewing this as a competitor to SWIFT? Is that how the vision is for this blockchain?","Marianne Lake","So, this is the Interbank Information Network which we talked at Investor Day. And now, we have I think 75 banks and growing signed up to it. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily look at it exactly like that. I would say, this use case at least for now is very much around reducing the friction in the wholesale payment space in terms of inquiry and information sharing and not at this point about processing payments. So, we are still exploring use cases across the board on blockchain. I\u2019m very excited about this and the uptake; it will be I think meaningful. But, I wouldn\u2019t think of it that way, not yet. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. ","Erika Najarian","My first question expands on what the Glenn had asked. So, clearly, the bank stocks have been hit along with the broad market. And I guess, you\u2019re telling us one of two things. One, either the economy is slowing down or the relationship between bank revenue growth and solid economic growth in the U.S. is broken or not somehow is correlated as expected. And I\u2019m wondering, given your fairly strong results across the board, where is the market wrong in terms of how they\u2019re thinking about either the economy or bank revenues related to a strong economy?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I would just start by saying, I think there is a lot of sort of macro uncertainty, noise and overhang that have been affecting the market over the last few days. So, overthinking any one driver or sort of confusion I think might be challenging. I would say that as we look at the economy, we don\u2019t see it slowing down. It seems to be continuing to grow pretty solidly. There is divergence around the world. So, it\u2019s led by U.S. strength, but still expecting there to be more convergence going forward. So, I actually think that our outlook is still quite optimistic on the global economy, and not to say to James\u2019 point that there are some risks out there.","And so, as we -- and also, just to talk about monetary policy for a second. Everything, given that growth outlook, is really sort of lining up for December rate hike and sort of more hikes into 2019 and the continuation hopefully of a steeper yield curve, and that all should be constructive for bank stocks. It is definitely the case that as we\u2019ve been talking about the years now, as the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet and liquidity is coming out of the system, yes, we are seeing deposit growth slow. And there is a natural feedback loop, as you reprice liabilities, you\u2019ll have a natural asset base response. And so you might have slower growth on the asset side relative to the past, but it should be at higher spreads, and that should be how it plays out. So, there is really no change, I don\u2019t think in our expectation of the drivers.","Erika Najarian","That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, and I picked up in part of your response to an earlier question Marianne. As we think about your wholesale loan trends year-over-year which continues to outpace the banking industry. Could you tell us a little bit more about the dynamics in terms of competition from non-banks, particularly in private middle market lending? And I guess, we\u2019re really wondering what you\u2019re observing in terms of competition more in structure rather than rates? And whether or not some of the liquidity that you noted could be drained out of the system, would change the competitive dynamics near term? And sort of what is JPMorgan\u2019s indirect exposure that remains on balance sheet on the sponsor-backed transactions. Sorry, I know that is a lot.","Marianne Lake","Yes. I\u2019ll try to remember all of that. First of all, I would just clarify that when you say wholesale loan growth has been outpacing the industry, I would say that from my recollection, over the course of the last several quarters, we\u2019ve basically been saying in line with, if not maybe even slightly less than in line with the industry, but it is nuance, you need to get beneath it. There are areas where we would fully expect to be growing more strongly than the industry, and those are in our newer expansion markets where we\u2019ve been investing, we\u2019re reaping the benefits of those investments, and we\u2019re growing from a smaller base and deepening into the market. In our core markets, the mature markets, in line to maybe not even quite as we are being cautious given where we are in the cycle. So, I just want to clarify that\u2026","Jamie Dimon","We haven\u2019t changed our standards.","Marianne Lake","We haven\u2019t materially changed our underwriting standards, no. And if anything, I would say, we\u2019re just being cautious of the margin. And with respect to competition outside of banks, it\u2019s definitely true that non-banks are gaining share. And it\u2019s also true that they are structure-wise going to be willing to do and are willing to do things that we are not. And so, for our best clients, we aren\u2019t largely going to lose on price, we would be willing to work on price. But we would walk away on structure. ","Jamie Dimon","And we don\u2019t have a lot of residual exposure to sponsors doing that kind of lending.","Marianne Lake","That\u2019s right.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","So, Marianne, look, I mean ROTCE of 17%, you seem to have some deposit market share gained, but year-over-year for the third quarter, expenses are up more than revenues. So, can you highlight the dollar amount of investment spending and how that\u2019s changed and where you are in that progression?","Marianne Lake","Yes. Just before we get into expense for a second, if you step back, just a couple of things. I wouldn\u2019t look at any one quarter when I\u2019m thinking about operating leverage, not to overplay seasonality or anything else. But, I would look at the whole year. And tax reform is an important part of that. So, if you look at year-to-date on a reported basis rather than a managed basis, year-over-year, year-to-date, we have about 200 basis points of positive leverage. So, tax reform is a big factor. And then, obviously, we had some private equity losses which are episodic in this quarter\u2019s revenue print. So, I think there is strong growth across the businesses. So, expense number and investments, our expenses are up over a $1 billion year-on-year, in line outside of FDIC and revenue related costs, in line with the guidance we gave at the Investor Day. So, think about that sort of $2.7 billion of year-over-year investments, and we\u2019re working through it. So, we\u2019re on track. It\u2019s different from revenues insofar as it\u2019s more linear. And so, expenses are in line and leverages -- positive leverages are I think pretty strong.","Mike Mayo","And just one separate question for you, Jamie. Your CEO letter highlights the expectation that interest rates would go a lot higher, so I guess for a long -- the track that you laid out. But, it doesn\u2019t seem like the market is digesting it as maybe as well as you might have thought the market would digest. So, it\u2019s basically what you expected. So, what\u2019s different between your expectations and how the recent market\u2019s been reacting?","Jamie Dimon","I think, I noted that the market may not take it that well if rates go up and -- because it\u2019ll surprise people a little, people shouldn\u2019t be surprise. And of course, so many things have changed as we\u2019ve been through this before, like monitory policy, liquidity ratios, capital ratios et cetera. So, I was also pointing out that -- just about probability that rates can go higher, people should be prepared for that; they should not be surprised about it. So, I\u2019m always surprised when people are surprised. And the why is more important? You\u2019re still growing. The economy is strong, rates are going up. Most of us consider it a healthy normalization, and going back to a more of a free market when it comes to asset pricing and interest rates et cetera, and we need that. So, to me, overall, it\u2019s a good thing, particularly because the economy is strong. And so, I do expect rates will continue to go up. We don\u2019t bet the company on that. That\u2019s just my own expectation. I have a -- I would put much higher odds in it being at 4% to most of the people, but again, the economy is strong. So, as long as it\u2019s normalized strong economy, it\u2019s a good thing. The economy could be strong for a while. I mean, Marianne pointed out wage is going up, participation is going up, credit has been written as pristine. Housing is in short supply. Confidence, both small business, consumer is extraordinarily high. And that could drive a lot of growth for a while, in spite of some of the headwinds out there.","Marianne Lake","I also think -- I mean, not exactly, but if you went back and looked a couple of years ago, what the 2-year forward 10-year rate would look like, it would look much like this. And so, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s been -- because the covers having a hard time pushing up that people are now focused on it, but this is what we would have expected, should expect and higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on deposits. We\u2019re starting to see some slowing of growth if not outflows in some areas as rates rise. How do you -- but you guys still have a loan to deposit ratio that\u2019s in sort of the mid-60s and you\u2019ve been gaining share on the retail side. What\u2019s your sense of I guess competition for deposit and pricing, particularly in the core retail bank?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, when we think about the -- well, it\u2019s not really about competition particularly. When we think about the deposit base and the retail consumer relationship, deposits and rate paid is a important part of it, but it\u2019s increasingly less important, not that it\u2019s not significant. And so, when you think about the value that we give to our customers, it\u2019s not just that but it\u2019s also all of the customer experience initiatives that we\u2019ve had, it\u2019s about convenience, about digital mobile capabilities, it\u2019s about launching new products, new services, simplifying the environment for them. So, there\u2019s a lot of different investments and things to play which might make this kind of normalization cycle look a little different. And so, the way we think about it is we look carefully across the spectrum of deposits, retail and wholesale at what we are seeing in terms of flows and balances and elasticity for our customers on our balance sheet. And that\u2019s how we think about our strategy for deposit reprice. And it\u2019s sort of largely behaving as we would have expected.","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019ll just make a macro point too. As the Fed reduces balance sheet -- just say by $1 trillion over the next 18 months or whatever, which they indicated they\u2019re going to do, that\u2019s $1 trillion out of deposits. That will have an effect kind of macro competition and stuff like that. And we try to estimate the big points, is it coming out of wholesale, kind of retail? It\u2019s hard to know. But that will change the competition a little bit for deposits.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, fair enough. And maybe a follow-up on that investment spend. Do you -- I mean obviously, it went up with the Tax Cut helping to accelerate some investments. Do we think of it going forward stabilizing at these high levels, or is this sort of a one-off sort of increase and we might see that come down or do we keep increasing? How do we think about the investment spent needs going forward a little further out?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say, and first of all obviously, we\u2019ll give you more thoughts on forward-looking guidance at a future date. But just generically, I wouldn\u2019t really put tax reform as being a primary reason for what we\u2019re doing on investments. I would say that we have identified the opportunity to accelerate capabilities that are consistent with our client strategic long-term goals and so we\u2019ve been leaning into that this year. And so, it was a pretty sizable step up this year acknowledging that. We wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see that continue. But, we\u2019re going to carry on investing in technology, adding bankers, opening branches, launching new products so that we\u2019re defending the long-term growth and profitability of the Company. And in the absence of giving you guidance, I would just point you to the fact that we\u2019re still targeting -- not targeting, but we\u2019re still expecting an overhead ratio to be around about the mid-50s over the medium term, which on revenue growth, implies we\u2019ll continue to invest and there is also volume-related costs associated with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning. Marianne, I was wondering on the regulatory front, do you any visibility into the future interaction of CCAR process with the new loan loss accounting rules, CECL, particularly in the context of the stress capital buffer potentially being implemented? Because it seems like we could have some overlapping procyclicality and then the potential to freeze that into the run rate capital. So, I was just kind of wondering, is there any visibility yet on that and is that a big area of uncertainty for you?","Marianne Lake","So, you hit the nail on the head with both your question and what that could imply. It is a big area of uncertainty. We do not have clarity on capital broadly as it relates to CECL, including whether there will be permanent capital relief and\/or how that will play into CCAR. It is one of the most open questions we have. So, right now, what we know is -- as far as I know, anyway that we don\u2019t have to put the CCAR impacted until -- sorry, CECL impact in until CCAR 2020. So, it\u2019s not sort of imminent question, but it\u2019s an important one, and we don\u2019t know the answer.","Jamie Dimon","It seems to me that every single time there\u2019s a chance to make things more procyclical or less, we make it more procyclical.","Marianne Lake","That\u2019s the data for sure. So, we would encourage the dialogue on clarifying capital treatments with large to be at the forefront of standard set of mind. ","Jamie Dimon","This also won\u2019t change our strategy. That\u2019s just accounting.","John McDonald","Got it. And then just as a follow-up. I was wondering how rising rates are affecting competition and capacity in the mortgage business, and whether the regulations in mortgage have made you open to reconsidering getting back into some areas that you exited after the crisis.","Marianne Lake","So, mortgage being a cyclical business as it is, we are, on higher rates, expecting the overall market to be down about 10% year-on-year. We are down in line maybe or more than that, but for us, it\u2019s a tale of two channels. We are flat year-on-year in the consumer channel, so decent consumer engagement and purchase market share. And we\u2019re down meaningfully in correspondent because we are pricing for some risk and higher rates. With respect to would we be willing to reconsider our opposition on mortgage, the narrative, the dialogue is constructive, but there hasn\u2019t actually been any resolution to the bigger challenges. So, if we can get that resolution, then, I think the answer would be largely, yes. Jamie?","Jamie Dimon","No. I would just add that mortgage -- the mortgage company is earning money, is doing quite well. Delinquencies are way down; we\u2019re competitive. We started Chase My Home. So, you can digitally track your mortgage process. And there\u2019s a lot of good stuff coming. And so, the big picture is pretty good. Obviously, refis and new home sales are probably down because of the rates a little bit.","Marianne Lake","And you are right. There is excess capacity in the market right now and that will clear -- it will clear itself out over the course of coming months. And we\u2019re in this for relationships, not volumes. And margins are under pressure as a result, but they will stabilize.","Jamie Dimon","And that is an area by the way where all the riskier lending has gone to non-banks pretty much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Al Alevizakos with HSBC.","Al Alevizakos","I would like to ask a question on the CIB. Especially, I would like to focus more about the outlook that you gave that the spreads are getting tighter. And I would like to know regarding the credit and securitization business where we\u2019ve seen issuance being quite slow during the summer, then continuing like that in September. Do you see that there is a risk-off mode in the market? And how would you believe that the revenues would actually move going in Q4 and then in the New Year? Do you think that generally fixed-income wallet would actually be going down?","Marianne Lake","A risk of what? Sorry.","Al Alevizakos","The what? Sorry.","Jamie Dimon","The risk of wallet will go down.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I\u2019d say, on the margin point, it\u2019s been the case that for particularly in the sort of more liquid space, you\u2019ve seen margins coming down consistently over the years. So, it\u2019s not necessarily that this is some sort of step change or new phenomenon, but it\u2019s competitive. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. On the SPG side, pipelines aren\u2019t strong at this point. So, we expect the fourth quarter to go much like the third.","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019ll just make a long-term point here too. In the next 20 years or so, the total fixed-income markets around the world are going to double. And that is just an important thing to keep back in mind. So, when you run the business, you run the business to capture your share of that doubling, and of course, margins over time will come down, and the way you do it is being transformed by electronics, et cetera, but it\u2019s a pretty good future outlook.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Marianne, on the consumer credit side, I should say, you made the point about card losses remaining low and -- towards the low end of what you had thought for the year. But, I also noticed that you also added to the card reserve and noted higher losses. So, can you give us the to and fro about just what you\u2019re seeing in the underlying on card and losses and trajectories? Thanks.","Marianne Lake","Sure. So, as you know, we\u2019ve been talking for a couple of years now about the fact that we did some targeted credit expansion in the card space a few years back. And naturally, as that seasons, it will -- risk-adjusted returns that are healthy, but underwriting loans with higher loss rates, which means that as that seasons that the overall portfolio loss rate will naturally increase, so, the higher the percentage of newer vintages are, the higher the loss rate will be, in accordance with our underwriting standards and at good risk-adjusted returns. So, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been tracking and guiding to, and expecting. The build this quarter was more about loan growth than it was about the seasoning of the charge-off rate, but it was a bit of both.","My comment about the performance though is if we had looked at the 2018 card loss rate as we did at the beginning of the year, we said we would have expected it to be closer to 3.25%, but there are three things driving it to be slightly better. The first is the pre-expansion vintages are holding up very well. So, the pre-2015 vintages continue to hold up very well. The second is that as we have continued to observe the newer vintages, we\u2019ve been rigorous in terms of, at the margin, doing risk pullbacks and ensuring we\u2019re managing the performance really well. And the third is that we\u2019ve been improving our collection strategy. So, a combination of factors have allowed us to deliver, apples to apples, a charge-off rate for the portfolio that\u2019s a little better than we would have expected coming into the year.","Ken Usdin","Yes. Great color. Thank you. Can I\u2026","Jamie Dimon","[Indiscernible] through the cycle number. So, you should explain that to them too.","Marianne Lake","Yes. And obviously, in this portfolio, as we go through the cycle, we would expect charge-off rates to continue to rise. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I emphasized that the pre-expansion vintages continue to be that kind of -- you\u2019ll remember we hit that 2.5% charge-off rate, which is extraordinarily low for this kind of portfolio, and we\u2019re still there for those pre-expansion vintages. So, naturally, as the cycle matures, we will see that rise, but we aren\u2019t seeing it yet.","Ken Usdin","Yes, makes sense. And can I ask you just on the other side, can you talk a little bit of auto in the same context too where the losses have been flat as a pancake? Can you talk about that, and also just that leasing side of the book, which we more see in the other income? Are you still seeing the same potential for growth in both the on-balance sheet and the leases?","Marianne Lake","So, on the loan side in auto, I would say that we are losing share as we competition from credit unions and captives that may have economic frameworks that are different from ours. We are not going to chase volume. We\u2019re going to get the appropriate return for the risks. So, we are -- our credit reflects our discipline on pricing and underwriting standards. And so, it is continuing to be flat to a little better. On the leasing side, we do leasing with our manufacturing partners. We are seeing very strong growth. We\u2019re very careful about how we think about residual risks and reserving on that portfolio, but it\u2019s very high quality growth. And that looks set to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","I just wanted to follow up on the question on operating leverage. And how should we think about the outlook for positive operating leverage, just more philosophically? Your efficiency ratio is currently not materially above the 55% through the cycle expectation. So, should we be thinking of positive operating leverage as part of the investment narrative, or is the goal really to invest in favorable business outcomes, operating leverage does what it does and really doesn\u2019t drive business decisions?","Marianne Lake","More the latter than the former. So, obviously, we have a view of what we think the right return profile for these businesses should look like. And we\u2019re investing to deliver those returns through the cycle and over the long term. So, we don\u2019t have an operating leverage target in mind when we set our investment strategy, nor do we for that matter have an expense target in mind either. So, again, we saw a reasonable step up year-on-year this year because we saw the opportunity to do that well. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see that kind of growth. But, again, operating leverage is more of an outcome, not entirely, but more of an outcome than an input.","Jamie Dimon","And mix.","Marianne Lake","Yes. And mix.","Saul Martinez","And, if I could just ask a quick follow-up on CECL, I know you don\u2019t manage the accounting outcomes. And I think, Marianne, you mentioned that a number of areas last quarter where CECL could have an impact. But, any update just on CECL preparations and when you think you might have an estimate of what the effects could be?","Marianne Lake","So, I appreciate that you guys have been asking about this now for a while. And I hate to tell you that the modeling, the data, the methodologies are complicated. So, operationally, we are working through that across all of our businesses. We continue to expect to be running in parallel through some parts of 2019 across some of our portfolios so that we can make sure that we fully understand the potential implications. We don\u2019t have a number for you. But, I will tell you this, same as I said last time. The biggest driver is likely to be card because of the size of the portfolio and the 12-month incurred loss model today. So, the weighted average life of the portfolio driven by revolvers would be longer than that most likely. There will be some other impacts, pluses and minuses. Research reports have been written. I think on average for those that have been written have suggested that not just for us, but across others that the reserve increase could be 20% to 30%. And while I don\u2019t have a number for you, it\u2019s not implausible.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I wanted to follow up on the discussion about increased competition in FICC. And I guess the language in the release kind of implied there was some increase in competition. Your comments on the call here say it\u2019s been competitive for some time. And I guess, I was trying to square those two. And I would just add that coming into this year, you had the Number one FICC share, and incredibly, you\u2019ve been the biggest FICC share gainer year to date when we look on a global basis. So, you\u2019ve been building on top of that share. And I\u2019m just trying to gauge if there\u2019s been a change among competition trying to get some of that share back and maybe if that\u2019s just started to accelerate.","Marianne Lake","I think if you go back a number of years when we were all having those like deep and meaningful debates about whether we should be changing our FICC operating model. And we were committed to the full spectrum, complete platform. You roll forward to 2016, there was outperformance in fixed income. And coming in -- and people had made changes to their operating model and operations. And the competition came back pretty fiercely, I would say, into 2017. And then, in 2017, the market didn\u2019t play nicely, particularly the volatility and volumes were less robust than they\u2019ve been in 2016. But we haven\u2019t seen the competition let up. So, people are back and wanting to enjoy. Jamie just talked about it. The fixed income wallet will double and pretty much, everyone everywhere wants to enjoy some of that. And so, the competition -- it\u2019s a combination of -- it\u2019s been very competitive for a while and it continues to be so. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a step change, but it does obviously feel particularly when volatility has been reasonably contained outside of specific emerging market kind of areas that everybody is competing for these thin margins.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then, just broadly speaking, if we look at both FICC and equity trading, obviously, you\u2019ve had the leadership position with FICC; you\u2019ve been gaining a lot of share in equity, including this year. What do you think the biggest driver of that is? It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the capital or liquidity advantage. Is it all the technology spend that you\u2019ve been doing? What are a couple reasons you\u2019d just chalk it up to high level?","Marianne Lake","So, if you think about the -- we\u2019re sort of gaining share most notably in cash and prime. And if you go back a number of years ago, we were pretty open and honest about the fact that we weren\u2019t where we needed to be in either of those two scenarios, and we have been consistently investing in the platform, and it is technology. Think about prime with -- building out of the prime platform, particularly internationally has been a game changer. And we\u2019ve had a best-in-class competitive offering over the course of the last couple of years. And now we\u2019re getting the momentum of being able to deliver that to clients. And similarly, we\u2019ve been investing in the cash side. So, it\u2019s across the complex, but we\u2019re getting the benefits of the investments we\u2019ve been making. I also think that the relationship effects of having the equities business with our private bank and with the commercial bank, the feedback loop is also quite powerful. So, it has a little bit to do with our operating model, our platform as a company.","Jamie Dimon","And really great research.","Marianne Lake","Yes. Great research.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Thanks. I had a quick follow-up question on the securities services. You mentioned that there was a decline sequentially based on seasonality and the exit of the business, but is there any way to size that to get to what the underlying growth trends were in that segment?","Marianne Lake","From an underlying growth trend perspective, I would look year-over-year rather than sequentially. I sort of point out the sequential points because of seasonality, we also exited U.S. broker\/dealer business. So that obviously has an impact. It is also the case. So, if you think about the year-on-year growth of 5%, we have been growing more than that, led by very strong growth in NII. For this business, this is a wholesale business where deposit bases are high. So, we would expect that growth to level off, and in this quarter in particular, just the specifics of our internal transfer pricing is that LIBOR OAS narrowed and it just had an impact. Year-over-year, continue to expect us to grow assets, asset-based fees, NII solidly but not as strongly, and transactions. So, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to be high single digit or mid single digit growth year-on-year.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thanks. And then, just one separate question on the non-interest bearing deposits, I mean it came down in the quarter. Was that mostly just on the corporate side, or was there also some pickup in the deposit gammas on the retail side as well?","Marianne Lake","Not on the retail side, not yet. There\u2019s not a sufficiently compelling rate differential to be driving into product migration on the retail side yet, but we are seeing it on the wholesale side.","Operator","The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize if you\u2019ve already addressed this, but can you give us the outlook for the pipeline for commercial loan growth or commercial loans in investment banking? I know it\u2019s very early in the quarter. But with the trading volatility we\u2019ve seen, any color that you can share with us on that as well?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, commercial loans, we\u2019re 4% up year-on-year, flat to 1% up sequentially. At this point, as we look forward over the near term, it feels like that kind of steady growth GDP plus, GDP is what we\u2019re going to get. And remember, everybody has a different mix, but one of the things that happened quickly with tax reform is that the government healthcare hospital not-for-profit space was less compelling from a loan sense, and now are going to be more compelling in the capital markets. So, we\u2019re seeing that impact our growth down. So, I would say that not quite mid-single digit growth feels like a decent outlook, all other things being equal.","In terms of the capital markets, well, I would say that the third-quarter pipelines coming out into fourth quarter and momentum sets us up for a decent fourth quarter honestly, across products. Clearly, volatility depending upon how long it stays around and what the drivers are, can impact business confidence. We\u2019re not necessarily expecting that. So, I would still say the outlook across products is good with ECM obviously being the one that would most likely impacted. But even there, I think it might be more of a sort of temporary set of pauses as people see how everything is digested. And honestly, on market, no good ever comes of trying to predict what a course will look like after a couple weeks.","And volatility is not necessarily a bad thing. It can be constructive in some ways and less in others. So, there\u2019s no good coming of a prediction at this point. I will say one thing about markets, just to give you guys a tiny view, which I know you now, but just because of tax reform and another one-off item in the fourth quarter, flat year-on-year comparably would be up.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good; I appreciate that. The second question is, when we look at the weekly H.8 data on Fridays, the smaller banks in this country are growing their loan books much faster than the larger banks. You obviously had good loan growth this quarter, but it doesn\u2019t match up to what the smaller banks are producing. So, the question is what impact do you think the CCAR process has had on you when you compare your underwriting prefinancial crisis? I know you\u2019re not changing your underwriting standards, but do you think the larger banks are more conservative as a general statement? And it\u2019s reflected in these very strong credit quality numbers you and your peers are posting today.","Marianne Lake","So, it\u2019s difficult to generalize. And obviously, everybody has sort of a different risk appetite. It might be fine if you\u2019re getting properly paid to grow more quickly. We are sticking with our guns in terms of our underwriting and risk appetite on credit. The other thing I think you have to bear in mind and again, it depends on the particular situation of any competitor is that we are materially and increasingly bound by standardized risk-weighted assets. And so, while we don\u2019t overthink that and we do honestly think about economic capital, at some level, we have to generate a positive return for shareholders and shareholder value. And it\u2019s on these very high credit quality loans that we\u2019re producing, it\u2019s expensive.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","I wanted to take a little bit different slant on deposit betas, just ask a three-part question. One, is the increase in deposit betas that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of Fed moves, surprising at all or abnormal in your opinion to normal historical trends?","Marianne Lake","So, I would say, if you look at the first four hikes, it was relatively muted deposit reprice across the complex. It accelerated for the last three hikes, I\u2019m excluding September, given obviously, when it happened. So, we are seeing an acceleration in betas. And it started at the top end of wholesale and it will migrate through the complex over time. I would say, it\u2019s in line to arguably better than we would have modeled, but remember that this cycle did start in a very different place. So, in a while if we looked at history, we might have seen reprice in totality having been higher at this point, we started at 100 basis points of rates, not 25. So, I think that plays into it too. So, generally in line with expectations is what I would say.","Marty Mosby","Okay. That\u2019s what I would say. So, let\u2019s go to the next question. Given that rates have been low for so long going up until we started increasing rates, we\u2019ve repriced almost every security and loan we had on the books. So, the actual upward potential to reprice portfolio yields to current market rates has got to be larger than what we typically have seen historically. Do you agree or disagree with that idea?","Marianne Lake","I would say, yes. Obviously, it depends on how you position the company over that period. But we talked about it before we were and have consistently been relatively short the market. We\u2019ve been keeping dry powder so we could invest as long as rates go up. And we still are looking at that. But obviously, there\u2019s convexity in the portfolio too, so, paying attention to that. Yes, I agree.","Marty Mosby","Yes. So, the stretch between this portfolio yield, so, asset yields can actually reprice faster than what we\u2019ve seen historically. So, the combination of those two things in our estimation gives us a threshold. So, if we saw backwards for deposit betas, it gives us a threshold if we estimate for JPMorgan of somewhere between 80% to 90% deposit betas before you actually break through and start eroding net interest margin. Currently, you had about a 40% deposit beta this quarter. So, you had a lot of headroom still to go before margins start to really erode, given deposit pricing. So, I just wanted to get a feel for that estimate of 80% to 90%, given where you\u2019re at today.","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, obviously, I don\u2019t know exactly your mental model, but let me tell you this. I think you\u2019re right -- I don\u2019t know about the 80%, 90% specifically, but you\u2019re right about net interest margin if you look through any short-term noise. So, we would expect the trend for our firmwide and core NIM to be \u2013 to trend or grind higher over time. But, it does depend on the path and pace of reprice. So, if we continue to see deposit betas stay low or lower than potentially, a linear kind of move, you\u2019ll see margins increase, and then, as they accelerate back to target, you might even see it compress. But, if you see through that over the long run, yes, net interest margins will be higher. And that will be driven mainly by balance sheet growth, mix, and long end of rates.","At Investor Day, you might remember, we told you that beyond 2018, net-net, there was little rate left to go, and it was going to be more about balance sheet, mix and growth, and long end of rates a little compounding. But, the path does matter. So, you can see core NIM in particular will be very vulnerable to the pace of reprice. Why would you look through that? Sorry. Operator?","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, everyone.","Jamie Dimon","Thank you."],"12224":["JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby.","At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Jamie Dimon","Yes, so this is Jamie and I\u2019m going to start if you don\u2019t mind. I know some of you may have questions about my recent cancer diagnosis. So I\u2019d like to make a few comments on that, so we can then hopefully focus on the reason for our call which is our quarterly earnings and the results of the company. First I want to thank everybody for their calls, their notes, their good wishes, it does mean a lot to me and my family. To start with I feel great. I think I\u2019ve some of the best doctors in the world. I\u2019ll be receiving the best treatment. I\u2019m very fortunate that this is curable. ","To recap we\u2019ve already talked about and what my doctor\u2019s told me about, we caught it early. It\u2019s confined to the original site and the adjacent lymph node in the right side of my neck. It\u2019s isolated in that specific area. The cancer has not spread. Importantly with all the tests they have done there is no evidence of cancer anywhere else in my body and it\u2019s curable with radiation and chemotherapy which I\u2019ll put down as fairly standard for this kind of cancer and the prognosis is excellent. ","The Board will be fully briefed on my condition and if they and I feel that it\u2019s necessary to make additional disclosures we will do that, but I really do think the next disclosure I\u2019m going to make will in be about seven or eight weeks saying the therapy is over. I am feeling better and the prognosis is excellent. My doctors have finalized their treatment plans with me over the last several days though I do plan as we go through the treatment to be actively involved in managing our business. I\u2019ve also been told that after the seven week treatment period I\u2019ve been advised to take rest. That does not mean I won\u2019t work. They just simply say to rest and recuperation should come before other things, which by the way is the exact same advise I give my friends, my family and any one from JPMorgan or anyone of you who came down to something like this. So I do plan to work, I do plan to read, I will be accessible. ","Succession planning that\u2019s why it\u2019s here, is exactly as it was before. There is no change whatsoever. The Board has plans in place and I talk about all the time from various scenarios and we are fortunate enough to have an exceptional group of executives. You know them all, I hope you take the time to tell some of the reports, their quality, I always tell there is a book in everybody and the book on the larger management team here is brains, ethics, work ethic, partnering, knowledge, experience, high quality people and I actually think that many of them can run a major financial company and my Board feels in the same way. And importantly the Board has been fully engaged with the senior leaders the whole time they have been at this company.","I also want to point out. We have a standing protocol in place before this, during this, and after this. We think it\u2019s simply good governance that if I am unreachable for any reason, remember I took a three week trip to Asia so, it\u2019s for a minute, an hour, a day or a week that they are to contact our lead director, who will get them the consent the advice and the help that they need so the company continues to go on as usual. ","So I will stop there and hand it off to Marianne, who will take you through the earnings of the company.","Marianne Lake","Okay, thanks Jamie. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","Starting now on page one. The firm delivered strong performance this quarter with net income of $6 billion on revenue of over $25 billion, EPS of a $1.46 and a return on tangible common equity of over 14%. The reported results as you can see on the page, include approximately $670 million of firm-wide legal expenses. In addition to that item there were a number of other smaller items, some positive, some negative in the result; most notably $350 million of consumer reserve releases. And we estimate our core performance for the quarter was also $6 billion plus or minus which is among the best we have ever had, which is a very good result especially given the challenging environment the market and mortgage which persisted during the second quarter and interest rates remaining low and the cost of control high.","Importantly in the firm\u2019s performance this quarter we are really seeing the benefit of our diversified earnings profile as well as the focus on investing and growing the underlying performance drivers in each of our businesses. They have translated into net income, growth and operating leverage in a number of businesses most notably CBB, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. ","We also continue to make significant progress against our capital target with a CET 1 ratio of 9.8% firm wide and bank supplementary leverage ratios of 5.4% and 5.6% respectively and remaining compliant with liquidity requirements, all while returning $3 billion of capital to shareholder this quarter with both share repurchases of $1.5 billion. Core loan growth was strong for the quarter at 4% and 8% up year-on-year with encouraging signs across our businesses and NII was up slightly this quarter on a relatively flat core NIM.","Turning to page two, before getting into each of businesses, a couple of comments here. You can see circled the adjusted expense for the quarter was $14.8 billion for an adjusted overhead ratio of 58%. This number does obviously exclude legal expenses but of note it includes a little less than $300 million of expenses related to business simplification which we consider to be non-core, including lower incentive compensation on lower CIB revenues for the first half, we have updated our adjusted full expense guidance to be $58 billion plus or minus, with a caveat that obviously the final number will depend on the performance related compensation for the full year.","We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses and operating as efficiently as possible across our businesses. You can also see on the page the returns generated this quarter by each of our businesses which is driving the strong performance of the firm overall. ","Moving on to page three, as I said the firm reported a CET 1 ratio of 9.8%, up from 9.6% last quarter as we increased our common equity Tier I capital base by over $4 billion principally through net retained earnings. Risk-weighted assets were broadly flat in the quarter with higher operating risk RWA and some growth largely offset by lower market and credit risk RWA reflecting increased model usage and portfolio runoff. We're are still on track to reach 10% plus CET 1 ratio by the end of the year as previously guided. ","The lower of our two transitional measures, and you will recall we exited Basel III parallel at the beginning of the quarter, so the lower of our two transitional measures which is technically the measure effected this quarter under the common floor is the Basel III advanced transitional ratio which is also at 9.8%. And what is on the page with full year information, the fully phased in standardized ratio is 10.1%. ","We continue to make good progress on our leverage ratio this quarter, both the firm and the bank SLR increased quarter-over-quarter by about 30 basis points. So we're obviously within sight of our 5.5% target for the firm and a 5.6% for the bank we do have a clear path to our 6% plus target. Finally on this page we continue to have a very strong liquidity position remaining compliant with LCR. ","Now moving on to the businesses starting on page four, Consumer and Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter and $11.4 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%. We continue to see excellent growth in the underlying business drivers with average deposit up 9% in CBB, our active mobile customers up 23%, credit card sales volume up 12%, client investment assets up 19% and crossing the $200 billion and according to J D Power we continue to be ranked number one in overall customer satisfaction as-well-as the mortgage originations among large banks, And number one in three of four regions with more business banking customer satisfaction. Finally across CCB we expect to exceed our headcount reductions outlined at Investor Day. ","Turning to page five, Consumer and Business Banking. CBB generated net income of $894 million, up a significant 28% year-on-year on net revenue of $4.6 billion with an ROE of 33%. While we do continue to see some pressure on deposit margins this continues to be more than offset by strong growth in deposit balances, the 9% I just mentioned among the highest in the industry. This deposit growth is driven by strong household growth and record customer retention. We added 800,000 net households since last year as our new branches continue to mature. ","On the non-interest revenue side we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in both debit and investment revenues as we deepen relationships with customers and as we see our global wealth management strategy play out with more affluent customers. In business banking the momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued. We have record originations up 46% year-on-year and 27% over last quarter back to levels that we last saw in 2012. We believe that this reflects a combination of improving industry trends driven by business optimism generally continuing to trend higher and improving banker performance especially in our expansion market where we've been investing and as our positive strategies mature. ","Our pipeline continued to strengthen, 2Q'14 was the highest level since 2012 and we do expect this positive momentum and strong growth year-over-year to continue in the second half of the year. Expenses flat year-on-year with efficiency gains in the branches being offset by higher cost of controls that we've spoken about but it was down quarter-over-quarter as cost of investments and controls are moderating. ","Turning to page six and Mortgage Banking, overall mortgage banking net income was $700 million for the quarter with an ROE of 16%. As expected the production environment remained challenging and mortgage production pretax income excluding repurchase was a negative $74 million for the quarter a little better than our guidance reflecting higher revenue margin on a mix shift towards retail loans and higher pipeline as well as good progress made in the quarter to reduce our fixed expenses. At this point, market dependent we expect the third quarter results to be broadly similar to the second quarter as more negative. ","Originations of $17 billion were flat quarter-on-quarter and down 66% year-on-year which is in a market that we estimate was seasonally up 25% quarter-on-quarter which shows that we continue to lose some share. Key drivers behind the share loss were the continuation of our strategy to reduce our participation in lower FICO and high LTD government loans as well as the burn out of HART. ","In addition we did lose some share in other conventional resulting from price competition as we maintained discipline regarding pricing to required returns. Mortgage production benefited in the quarter from a repurchase reserve release of positive $137 million driven primarily by refinement in expectations regarding certain residual risks following the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2013. ","On to servicing, net servicing related revenue of $693 million is down slightly quarter-on-quarter but is higher than guidance due primarily to higher gains on acquired securities and Ginnie Mae loan sales, while we do expect to continue to benefit from both during the second half of the year to a lesser extent than the first and these gains can be lumpy. So we expect servicing revenue to decline in the third quarter to $600 million plus or minus and servicing expenses are moderately down quarter-on-quarter.","MSR risk management was a net gain this quarter of $338 million, driven by a $220 million positive model update on slower prepayment fees which remember we would have earned otherwise overtime through [model miss] and which reflects the impact of the burn out of HART [inaudible] momentum. On real estate portfolios compensation on credit we see net charge off for the quarter of $111 million and reserve releases of $300 million in the purchase credit impaired portfolio reflecting actual and expected appreciation in home prices. There were no reserve releases in the quarter for the non-credit impaired portfolio although [inaudible] trends do continue. We do expect to see reserve releases in NCI over the next couple of years in total between $500 million and $1 billion as the credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve and lastly on real estate portfolios in the quarter we added $5 billion of loans to the portfolio. ","Finally mortgage headcount was down approximately $5,000 year-to-date and we expect to exceed our investor day target of approximately $6,000 for the full year of 2014.","Turning to page seven, Card Merchant Services and Auto, net income of $840 million, down 33% year-on-year or down 11% excluding reserve releases delivering an ROE of 18%. While down on declining reserve releases, the results do reflect strong underlying metrics. Sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 25th consecutive quarter primarily due to strong sales engagement of new customers. Our new acquisitions vintages are performing exceptionally well. ","In Merchant Services we have seen strong volume and transaction growth year-over-year with our client sales volume gaining momentum reflecting several large account wins in the quarter. Strong revenue of $4.6 billion was up slightly quarter-on-quarter but down 3% year-on-year and when you think about the year-on-year decline we\u2019ve reached the point where spread compression and strong fee growth are flat. So the net decline is driven by high amortization of customer acquisition cost and the absence of fees related to discontinued products in 2013. ","Expense was up 8% quarter-on-quarter and $0.07 year-on-year driven by control, the timing of marketing investments and this quarter includes $125 million of the legal expense I talked about.","Moving on to credit, losses continue to improve albeit at a slower pace and the card net charge-off rate has remained very low at 288 basis points and we released $50 million of student lending reserves in the quarter. Card outstanding momentum has shifted. End of period outstanding grew by $1.8 billion or 1.5% year-over-year with growth coming across our product set fueled by the strong sales performance I highlighted. Core growth is now outpacing one-offs and we acquired over 2 million new accounts in the quarter, up 40% year-on-year. ","Before we move on, a few words on Auto, new vehicle sales continue to grow year-on-year and the June start results reached the highest levels since 2006. We\u2019ve seen the 11th straight quarter of loan and lease growth as our partners continue to outpace the general market which remains competitive. The auto pipeline remain healthy consistent with the recovery in the auto market.","Moving onto slide eight, and the Corporate and Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $9 billion and an ROE of 13%. In banking total revenue was $3.1 billion, down 3% year-on-year. IB fees at $1.8 billion, up 3%. We maintained our number one ranking in global IB fees per Dealogic and widened the gap to number two.","Revenue growth was driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees and loans and underwriting fees were up we had strong and relative performance for the quarter. The IB pipeline remains solid with an environment supportive of M&A and a large diversified IPO backlog. Treasury services revenue of a $1 billion was in line with our guidance, down 4% year-on-year driven by lower trade finance revenue and the impact of business simplification. And lending revenue was down $80 million year-on-year driven by low NII that was up 5% quarter-over-quarter.","Moving on to Markets and Investor Services, reported markets revenue was down 14% year-on-year versus our guidance of 20% plus or minus with fixed down 15% and equities revenue down 10%. Included in these results are gains of over $100 million on the sale of market partner shares post IPO. Excluding this our results would have been down 15% year-on-year.","In fixed the decline was driven broadly across macro products and in commodities with volatility remaining very low and with the exception of a few more active weeks in June volumes also low. In equities, the decline was driven by derivatives where client volumes are highly correlated to volatility levels. ","In terms of outlook for the coming quarter and the second half, June was a better month somewhat broadly but that momentum has not continued into July so far and volatility remains very low across products. As such it is our [central case] that the third quarter will face a similar environment through the first half of 2014 and we expect normal seasonal trends.","Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposit and higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody. AUC reached a record $21.7 trillion up 14% year-on-year. Quarter-on-quarter revenue was up on seasonality in the depository receipt and agent lending businesses.","Moving on to expense, total expenses was up 6% year-on-year. Compensation expense was down 8% with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 31%. And we expect the full year comp-to-revenue ratio to likely end between 30% and 35% rather than at the low end of the range. Non-compensation expense was up year-on-year by 20% with the quarter including over $300 million of legal expense and a little less than $300 million of non-core expenses associated with business simplification I mentioned earlier.","Moving on to Page nine, on the Commercial Bank, we have very good earnings from the Commercial Bank this quarter with net income up 6% from last year and an ROE of 19%. We saw strong performance on key underlying business drivers, driving revenue of $1.7 billion up 3% sequentially, with gross ID fees up 25% year-on-year driving the first half of the year to a record and on a higher NII driven by higher loan volume and day counts. ","We added $3.3 billion of loans in the quarter with growth across the board in all of our businesses. Our consistent growth in real estate continued with loans up 2% in the quarter and 14% in the year and after a flat start to year we are happy to see C&I growth of 3% in the quarter in line with the industry. Revolver utilization picked up three percentage points versus the end of last year. Pipelines are up which should be supportive of trend in the second half of the year. The environment remains competitive but stable driving some continuous spread compression and we continue to see some pricing pressure to varying degrees in the businesses. ","Expense was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter but higher than last year reflecting our commitment to the regulatory and control agenda. Expect expenses for the businesses of approximately $700 million in the third quarter. And our credit performance remains exceptional with net recoveries in the quarter.","Moving on to page 10 and Asset Management, an excellent quarter in asset management with net income of $552 million up 10% year-on-year and 25% quarter-on-quarter, with a 25% ROE and 30% pretax margin hitting our three [inaudible] target. For the full year these ratios will be slightly lower as the business continuous to invest in both infrastructure and control as well as select tranches of hiring, but we\u2019re on track to deliver at our target for the full year of 2015.","Revenue was $3 billion was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting an increase in management fees driven by record long term net inflows of $34 billion for the quarter, including the benefit of a large institutional fixed income mandate. This marks the 23rd consecutive quarter of long term inflows driving AUM of $1.7 trillion up 16% year-on-year, and we continue to expect strong flows going forward. ","Looking at the mix of flows by product, we saw continued strength in our multi-asset and alternative flows, inline with our best quarter. In fixed income we had our strongest quarter flows ever and our best quarter in over a year excluding the large mandate I mentioned. And lastly despite solid equity performance in the quarter flows did not follow as investors showed hesitance to add to their positions at these levels. ","Expense of $3.1 billion with up 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher cost of controls and investment in growth. ","Lastly in banking we reported solid performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances surpassed the $100 billion mark up 17% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter with growth coming from both our U.S. and our international markets. We continue to see a solid pipeline for loan demand for the remainder of the year. And the average deposits were also up year-on-year by 8% but seasonally down 1% sequentially.","Moving on to page 11 and Corporate Private Equity, private equity overall had a flattish result, driven by net gain on dispositions partly offset by unrealized losses. And our private equity portfolio declined by approximately $1 billion. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $46 million, NII was a negative 10. That\u2019s up by $80 million by quarter-on-quarter driven by high investment security balances and the continued benefit of higher reinvestment yield. In the quarter we deployed $27 billion in gross new investment. ","Finally on this page other corporate net income was over $400 million. Included in the results are tax related benefit of over $200 million and as I mentioned earlier we reported firm wise legal expense pretax of $670 million for the quarter of which $227 million is here on corporate. ","Moving on to outlook on page 12, we did receive positive feedback from our most recent guidance disclosure in the 10-Q so we replicated it and updated it here. ","A few final comments, it is too early for us to give specific guidance for market revenues but we do expect the current environment to persist into the third quarter and to the second half and also experience no more seasonal trends. For the third quarter we generally expect mortgage production to be similar to this quarter, a small negative.","We expect firm wide adjusted expenses for the full year of $58 billion plus or minus and expect credit trends to continue to be very strong across the board with consumer reserve releases that will be more periodic and modest.","So to wrap up a very, very strong result for the quarter notwithstanding headwinds, reflecting the strength of each of our businesses and the benefit of our operating model. With that operator we would like to open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. ","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","","\u2026that you have shared in the past if you have a parallel shift of a 100 basis points, what that will do to your net interest revenue?","Marianne Lake","So Gerald you got cut off at the beginning but you are asking for earning -- the risk on the 100 basis points shift. ","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","That's correct. ","Marianne Lake","It was in the first quarter and we haven't disclosed it yet for the second quarter but it wouldn\u2019t be meaningfully different in the first quarter, it was $2.5 billion.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Do you see, going forward that changing in the way you are approaching your interest sensitivity, as the likelihood of rising interest rates increases in 2015 or should it remain pretty much constant? ","Marianne Lake","So I mean the risk is a representation, it\u2019s an instantaneous parallel shift. If you look actually at our disclosures you can also see what a steepening looks like. So the way I would characterize the way to think about the impact of asset sensitivity and interest rates rising is the way we described it both at our Investor Day and at the Morgan Stanley Conference which is when rates rise, whenever that starts which maybe in the second half of 2015 at the short end and the long end continued, that overtime that would deliver $8 billion to $10 billion of NII for the firm but clearly the path to get there would be rate dependent and timing. ","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Tying into the higher interest rates you have been vocal about your funding side of the equation and you what you expect there. Can you give us an update or more color of how you are positioned for the funding side of the balance sheet should rates rise and how much you expect to potentially maybe move off your balance sheet as it gets re-priced into different types of products? ","Jamie Dimon ","This is Jamie. I think on the funding side and we said we\u2019ve met pretty much LCR and SFS and we think it will be the [GLAC] or at least we are very close to it. That's all embedded in interest rate exposure which Marianne gave you and that's our base case. Obviously if the world changes we may change how we go about and do that. But that I think it's a very good base case to look at. We don't have any need to change it dramatically. You all have to be prepared for the reason that rates raise will obviously will change why people act in a certain way. ","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","And my final question is there has been some talk about the regulators, the Federal Reserve maybe increasing the capital ratios for the largest banks to even higher levels than what you are mandated today to carry. Do you guys have any thoughts on whether that may actually ever get through that they may even raise the current Tier I common ratio numbers? ","Jamie Dimon","I think we would have to wait and see. Remember the United States has already gone beyond most other countries and they may just be referring to that, that they intend to keep that or how they modify that. ","Marianne Lake","And I think the way that we think about -- obviously we don't know how things may change in the future but between the recent surcharge, the buffers that we and other institutions are going to run above that with LCR and SFR already entitled in the framework with capital stress comp testing under [SICAR] under extremely severe conditions, it feels like we have a box around it and so we're planning to run the firm based on what we know today with an eye on obviously listening to all other things you hear. ","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Great, and Jamie good luck on your treatment and I hope for a speedy recovery. Thank you. ","Jamie Dimon","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Good morning. Jamie first of all let me say it's nice to hear you on the call and that you are sounding good and that the prognosis sounds great and I wish you all the best. ","Jamie Dimon","Thank you. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Just a follow-up on the interest rate point for a second, I know you guys have been very focused on the potential for a deposit drain as things are handled somewhat differently by the Fed given the current circumstances when they eventually do raise rates. Is there any change in that thinking of the potential for a trillion-ish deposit drain and maybe a $100 million for yourselves on the basis of the fed minutes from last week which maybe were a little contradictory in terms of the mechanics to that Peterson Institute article which has been I think front of mind in everyone's thinking? ","Jamie Dimon","So keep in mind, the Fed whether they use repo or just sell securities that will reduce deposits. It's a factor with an absolute formula. The question is who\u2019s deposits, what kind of deposits and when they might do something like that, I assume they will be very careful. I think what we're simply were saying that some of the deposits will come out of non-operating wholesale deposits already have [HQA], some won\u2019t, some will come out of retail and just people will need to be prepared for it. I wouldn't from the category just when these be prepared and be very thoughtful about how we go about that.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","And given where you are on LCR, do you feel like JPMorgan is completely positioned as it will want to be at that time or is that still just a bill that's going to take place in liquidity between now and year from now or so?","Jamie Dimon","I think we're very comfortable where we are.","Marianne Lake","Yeah and remember that we are running LCR is an important measure, it's a regulatory measure, you know we are measuring it, we are posting it but we run the firm based upon our own internal liquidity tests and we are comfortable with that.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Great. The other thing that I'd like on touch on is the expense guidance. Obviously it's ticked down somewhat again and that's probably partly because of the revenue outlook that we\u2019re looking at for this year. But is there anything implicit in that in terms of what we should expect for expenses beyond 2014 and then maybe you can elaborate a little bit on how you are thinking about core expense reductions given a consistently pretty sticky revenue environment?","Marianne Lake","So I mean really what I would point you to is that the discussions that we had, largely at our Investor Day which was to say that we continue to expect the mortgage expense story to play out over the course of the next few years which will be obviously a tailwind for us on expenses both in servicing but more particularly in production. So that is obviously a focus in 2015 and beyond. We also are expecting to start on a journey to delivering and we saw that CBB expenses, our cost of controlled investment are moderating and Gordon outlined at Investor Day that the CBB business \u201814 through \u201816 as a relative marker would deliver approximately a $1 billion of expense efficiency but the profile of that we haven't been through. ","And then Daniel is working through, as are all of the other CEOs the expense story in the CIB and being as diligent as you would expect him to be given the environment but one of our positions has always been that we are running this business for the longer term and we are going to be smart about the actions we take on expenses in order to make sure that we protect the franchise but that doesn't mean that we can\u2019t and won't be more efficient across the businesses. So we haven\u2019t actually given specific guidance at the firm wide level but that\u2019s the backdrop.","Jamie Dimon","And I just want to reiterate that we always have waste cutting like real estate people straight through processing, vendors, things we think got a little sloppy, where we were located but we will never ever, ever stop investing in straight through processing better bankers, better training, chase that marketing, EBK is another new stop from branches so don't confuse the two. We are lumping them together for you, internally no one goes to a budget meeting says I get expenses down by cutting expenses on the really important things that we need for the future, no one. We are not going to run the company that way, we\u2019d rather earn less money. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Okay. That's, that's helpful. And then a final one\u2026 ","Jamie Dimon","Including that is paying our people fairly.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Okay. That's obviously important. One last one from me, there have been quite a few areas where you pulled back in order to ensure the ability to monitor and being compliance, third party mortgage origination was one, trade finance and in particular correspondent banking internationally another one, Is all of the foreseeable pull back in areas of business for control reasons pretty much known now or there other things that we should expect that you might be looking at?","Marianne Lake","Well so I would say that we are, it's a matter of good housekeeping that we would constantly be looking at making sure that we are simplifying our businesses where it make sense to do it but as a large matter, that macro matter we are working through the things that we talked about, some of the things that you mentioned and there were no significant changes.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Okay. That's great. Thanks so much.","Jamie Dimon","But we have got a 1,000 correspondent banks we sold CWK, it made very well, we sold RPS there are a bunch of product lines we\u2019ve either closed down or eliminated and a lot of that\u2019s in the works. We put a light -- enhanced monitoring our other businesses so we are well along the way but if something comes up that we think we should look at again we\u2019ll look at it again.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Okay. So actually let me just follow up on it to make sure that we don't over model revenues. Are there still meaningful incremental revenue declines that we should expect from all of those areas that have been discontinued?","Marianne Lake","The most significant revenue effect that's not yet in our run-rate because the transaction is not yet closed is the exit of the physical commodity business and so obviously when that closes which maybe in the early part of the fourth quarter that would have an impact in revenues both in the quarter and then in our run-rate in 2015. ","Jamie Dimon","And we gave you a number at Investor Day, I wish I got that number. ","Marianne Lake","Well I could give you the numbers now, so at Investor Day we said that the impact in 2014 on revenues would be a decline of $1.6 billion, just given the timing of the physical commodities deal, the impact in '14 is going to be closer to $1.3 billion of which about $500 million is in our run-rate already. ","Jamie Dimon","Is that [inaudible]. ","Marianne Lake","Yeah. And then you annualized the things that will be complete by the end of the year that 85% of everything is also going to get done. So once we close this year, the impact this year will be $1.3 billion. The annualized impact that we gave was $2.8 billion and that's still our best estimate. ","Jamie Dimon","And the important thing is for the franchises as the management, commercial banks, CIB, CCB are all doing really, really well and this doesn't affect their ability to serve their clients at all.","Marianne Lake","And remember also just for the purpose of completeness I'd be remiss if I not state the expenses are also coming out as we take those revenues out and that remember these are in large part businesses that were not at this time accretive to the overall firm\u2019s return, so important to remember that. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Great. Thanks for the completeness of the answer.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Hey there. ","Marianne Lake","Hey, Glenn. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Hello there. So we've seen a greater number of sales in the Repo market and it seems to me of just an issue of available collateral but I am curious to get your take, how much we're supposed to carry and whether or not some of the actions by treasury can and the reverse repo market can take care of that? ","Jamie Dimon","Look I think because the treasury, the government is still buying a big portion of net treasury issuance and because they are doing it going in the repo market and taking cash out of the system I think that number has maybe gone from $100 billion to $200 billion overtime. Remember I believe that, that Repo can't be re-hypothecated. So I do think some of the things will cause some issues in the repo market but my guess is that will sort through overtime. We do believe we\u2019ll see dealers reducing their books in Repo and you have heard a lot of statements about repo and collateral and capital against it, so I think that will sort out over time. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. Good. It sounds like you are not losing too much sleep over it. ","Jamie Dimon","Not yet. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Marianne you mentioned a comment on when you talked about C&I loan growth I just wanted to get a clarification. Last quarter if I remember correctly it was about flattish on year-on-year basis and you spoke about price competition and some discipline on JPMorgan's part. This quarter you have a little bit more year-on-year growth, still mention the comment about discipline but I just wanted to get a clarifying statement, is this growth a little bit better, is the backdrop a little bit better and you expect to participate in that a little bit more. ","Marianne Lake","Yeah, so I would say that there hasn't been a step shift in sentiment but the sentiment is better. It feels like year-over-year it\u2019s better quarter-over-quarter and it has allowed up to -- it\u2019s delivered right in line with the industry. And we do however maintain, absolutely maintain credit risk discipline as it relates to the commercial side. So it is competitive. It hasn't been the case that we've historically been losing on price, it has been more on [inaudible] and on simplification and listing but\u2026 ","Jamie Dimon","I think Marianne mentioned that in almost every category of C&I and on the commercial bank utilization was up by 1% last quarter and maybe 1%... ","Marianne Lake","Utilization in commercial was up 3% at the end of the year. ","Jamie Dimon","Since the end of the year. Utilization is usually a pretty good measure of companies starting to expand and early on it's receivables and inventory. You haven't really seen in capital expenditures yet and if you look at the U.S. capital expenditures in total including big businesses they are kind of flat to down, that will ultimately be the driver of real growth. So if you start to see that you are going to hopefully see a stronger economy but utilization is I think is the first sign.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","I appreciate that. The last one is I just couldn't help notice the balance sheet is now at $2.5 trillion. In your discussions -- I know we can't purchase our way through without jumping a lot of hurdles but do you feel constrained on just sheer balance sheet size, I mean you are and the reason I ask I look across most of your franchisees they are growing and they are growing nice and they are growing organically to the investments you have made. I just wanted to know if anybody is bringing up the issue of just absolute size?","Jamie Dimon","No, but I just give you a number that, like I think year-over-year that balances up mostly to the money we have at the fed, even quarter-over-quarter you got this -- we have $350 billion or almost $400 billion at central banks around the world. We have an investment portfolio of $350 billion, we\u2019ve a loan portfolio of $700 billion. We already told you when they start to reverse QE III some of those will automatically come down. So our balance sheet is kind of high because of all this huge liquidity and securities in the balance sheet and eventually hopefully there will be more loans which are more productive and less just holding excess cash.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Eventually maybe a little capital return too?","Marianne Lake","Yeah, just to illustrate the point if you look at, if you are looking at the slides you are looking end of period assets that grew by $40 billion or so. If you look at the average it was only $18 billion. We got a lot of volatility around the cash move at quarter end. So Jamie is right, there has been a significant amount of our -- has been deposit and ultimately funds like on deposit with the central bank.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Great, I appreciate the answer.","Marianne Lake ","I would say again having said that of course we are, there is a natural healthy tension now with leverage roles that we are clearly strategically optimizing the way we use our balance sheet and that would have a natural tension to keep the balance sheet growth if there is growth to be more modest.","Jamie Dimon","And we are also seeing -- we are talking about G50, the big Chinese banks, the big Japanese banks and some other banks around the world growing really rapidly. Hopefully that will reduce our G50 growth a little bit too.","Marianne Lake ","And if we are right about the liquidity drain in QE you will see a bunch of deposits flow out essentially in the second half of next year and you see some of that will reverse.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","All right. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning. ","Marianne Lake ","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","A couple of questions, one FICC, one in expenses and one on RWAs. Just on the FICC line you mentioned that it was a little bit better in the last part of June and then you went on to say that the outlook is for current environment to persist. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about which environment, you are talking about just the overall quarter, because the quarter ends up being a little bit better than expected right in the mid part of the quarter. Are you suggesting that you know the end of June activity is, is likely to keep a positive tone to what's you are expecting in third quarter. ","Marianne Lake ","Thank you for the question. Because I want to make sure I am very clear. So in June we did see an uptick in activity in terms of client activity but volatility stayed very, very low and there was no specific catalyst for it, no catalyst that would lead up to believe that was necessary to continue and as we have moved into July it so far has being our experience that has not continued at that level. So it is more -- our guidance for second half is that 15% to 20%, the 20% plus or minus decrease that we have seen in the past for that kind of environment is the one that we're facing over the second half. ","Now we are not guiding to a number because as you very well know it -- have many -- days into the quarter and things can change that. So you are going to have to pick your level but we can't predict it any better than that.","Jamie Dimon","In forecast, it's our operating assumption it going to stay at low levels for a while. We know we are going to be wrong in that but you will have to pick whatever you think.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Sure. Okay.","Jamie Dimon","We run the company planning for low and hoping for better.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And that's 15% year-on-year?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","That's 15% plus or minus down year-on-year?","Marianne Lake","We are not giving a specific guidance, it was 20% in the first quarter, 15% in the second, that kind of environment.","Jamie Dimon","The third quarter\u2019s generally lower and it could be lower than that\u2026","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then on the expenses you have outlined a couple of different areas that you are working on to get the expenses down. The question is on -- why in the IB you've got the repositioning cost called out specifically. Because I'm just kind of thinking aloud that those -- you've got to investigate expense saves in a broad, broad sort of areas of the business. So why call it out in the IB, does it suggest that we'll see more repo cost coming through in other areas over the next several quarters as people roll out their expense plans?","Marianne Lake","So we called out the $300 million if that\u2019s what you are referring in the CIB because it in our view anyway is a modestly sized and non-recurring item. We are not expecting to have similar items like that, we may have some but we are certainly not forecasting that we are going to have that kind of level recurring.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And the other\u2026 ","Marianne Lake","So really I'll just give you a sense that in the quarter we\u2019ve built that number and -- what you were to do with it in terms of your models but we don\u2019t consider that to be called.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay but in the other areas where you are also working on expense programs you don\u2019t expect that that you are going to have any of those kind of one time repo items, repositioning items.","Marianne Lake","","No at this time, not significant.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, all right and then on the RWAs you indicated that RWAs were up a little bit on op risk down on marketing credit risk and then you went on to say that it was model related, is that all your internal models, is that based on consultation with regulators, I am just wondering why the op rates could have gone up for you given that you had your big settlement a couple of quarters ago?","Marianne Lake","Yeah, so first of all these are all the moving parts, none of them are materially significant. So operating risk went up a little bit, growth in op a little bit and offset against that we continue to always on board positions on to our proved models continued to develop our models and get approvals for our models, so that we can have the most efficient RWA that we can have and so we saw some of that and also portfolio run-off. So we were just giving you some color that flat RWA is actually the continuation of the work that we articulated at Investor Day that will ultimately drive it down to be closer to $1.5 trillion over the next 18 months.","Jamie Dimon","Well a little inconsistent up-fronting all the negatives fully phased in we are not up-fronting model approvals we expect to get.","Marianne Lake","","Our model onboarding.","Jamie Dimon","A model onboarding or stuff like that there were some of that coming and obviously those need to be approved by regulators.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Got it, okay and then Steve said the other day including again CDOs, you had some CDOs back in the day, does that impact how you are thinking about the op risk charges? ","Jamie Dimon","Not material.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. ","Jamie Dimon","We are doing run off all the time for RWA and everything else is not material and they could be restructured, I think those are 2017 now and\u2026","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","All right, hey thanks a lot. ","Marianne Lake","","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","","And your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Stanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","","Hi Marianne following up on loan growth commentary, net interest income dollars seemed a little better than you expected at $11 billion are you still looking for that to be flattish kind of top of the house NII for this year or is the outlook a little better given the loan growth trends. ","Marianne Lake","","So we said relatively flat. It came up slightly in the quarter and obviously we are pleased with that and we told you that we expected core growth for the year to be 5% plus or minus and at this point that would still be our best assessment. If loan growth does continue to improve and improve to the point where our core loan growth is above 5% then yes we would hope to enjoy that NII benefit. But as we look forward based upon current rates broadly flat with a little bit above the bias is our outlook until rates start to rise.","","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","Okay In terms of share buy back\u2026 ","Marianne Lake","Because you do continue to have, albeit that everything is a little bit less than it was but you do continue to have offset against that in terms of spread compression.","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","Okay so with the 5% core loan growth you expect NII to be relatively flat this year and flat to up a little bit next year.","Marianne Lake","","Yes, it\u2019s market and slide curve is in fact how things play out.","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","","And then on share buyback could you give us some thoughts about how you are thinking about using your buyback approval for this year, did you accelerate some of the buyback activity on price weakness in this quarter and do you expect to do more in second half because the RWA reductions are starting to happen?","Marianne Lake","So first of all obviously what we can do is guided and limited by what we have approval to do. But yes we did articulate that we were going likely back end our share repurchases as we build to [RT ET1] ratio. You can obviously see we have built towards that nicely at 9.8% and then yes obviously particularly in the first half of the quarter our price was favorable and we did share repurchases reflecting all of those things. ","When we look at the second half without giving specifics because we don\u2019t give guidance on repurchase we have the capacity to do $5 billion more growth over the next three quarters and we have a target to hit about 10% and we will juggle those two things together but that gives us the capacity to continue to do some repurchases. ","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","Okay, that\u2019s helpful thanks. And on the mortgage servicing revenues the outlook that you gave for $600 million roughly does that include any MSR risk management gains or do you assume none in that, can you just clarify that?","Marianne Lake","We assume none in that. Think about the MSR risk management as we generally speaking expect our results to be close to home say plus or minus zero outside of any model updates because of our hedging strategy. ","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","Okay, and last question on legal cost this quarter they are mostly in the IB and in corporate, any commentary on what type of issues you\u2019re currently accruing for and also could you clarify whether you have any remaining outstanding material mortgage litigation or is that mostly settled from the mortgage area?","Marianne Lake","So as much as I know you want to hear it and we\u2019re not going to talk about the specifics that what we are aiming for and we told you -- we said before that we had very little in the first quarter, we have $700 million now. It\u2019s going to be this way for a while we\u2019re going to have elevated and lumpy litigation cost as work through the issues that you\u2019re aware of and with respect to mortgage we have battled with a large proportion of our NBS risks with the government account policy so we do still have some other civil claims. We would characterize there is more behind us than in front of us and we\u2019re working through it. ","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. First, why did trading do better than the guidance earlier in the quarter and did that relate to the 8% increase in trading bar which was a little surprising since volatility is still low?","Marianne Lake","Okay so just on the absolute performance, so first of all few things primarily contributed to the better performance. We said 20% plus or minus remember that, really could have been plus or minus when you go back three weeks before quarter end. There was a better activity in June. So June was a stronger month, every day on average produced a strong result than the prior few months in that and we didn\u2019t have line of sight to that when we gave our guidance and when we affirmed our guidance and the second I called out the market partners, shared the IPO and we --- post the IPO and generated gains of over $100 million which is a couple of points.","Jamie Dimon","And as far as, it\u2019s very hard to predict FICC really reluctant to do it, because somehow you think you actually know it\u2019s going to be -- I am couple of weeks. And the bar jumps around but some of that something around is nearly think of underlying positions [CMDS] and warehouse positions and stuff like that, which come and go. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay no, I always prefer more guidance than less. And then I have two very simple questions with complicated answer I guess but you talked about loan growth, is this the inflection point for loan growth and on the one hand you said while there is some inventory build that\u2019s helping and on other hand you\u2019re not seeing CapEx yet and two quarters ago you said second half of the year loan growth should really accelerate, do you still believe this should accelerate from this level, is this the acceleration or you\u2019re revising back some of those expectations?","Marianne Lake","So what we said Mike is that what we have seen in the second quarter gives us reasons to be optimistic that we\u2019re going to continue to see growth around those levels in the second half of the year. Like I said it\u2019s not that we\u2019ve seen a step change but that we have seen generally better sentiment, generally better utilization rates, generally higher pipelines and the phones are ringing, it\u2019s cross geographies. So it feels like the environment is conducive for us to continue to be able to add. We\u2019ve been very successful in the business banking space and yes in cards, so it\u2019s our belief that we\u2019ll have strong year-over-year in the second half but we are still in the early stages of seeing that happen. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And if interest rates increase at some point that could hurt the ability of commercial and commercial real estate borrowers to service their debt. How much cushion is there before you think that would become an issue or that\u2019s just not a factor?","Jamie Dimon","I just want to add it\u2019s not really a fact of people who are already income producing locked in rates and things like that and they really won\u2019t be effective for people who want to build new things. But not only on the commercial side but we did look at on the residential side, there have been occasion we have rising rates and improving housing. So depending why rates are going may be the more determinant factor than just the fact that rates are going up. Rates are going up to able to help the economy and maybe more important than just the fact the rates going up, right. We have not done the same thing in commercial, we probably should. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","I guess the more general question is what areas in credit are you watching the most, I think Marianne you said auto was the best since 2006 and that\u2019s been an area mentioned by regulators, is that the point of greatest concern or are there other areas you are watching more closely?","Marianne Lake","Well, what we are doing is being consistent on our credit discipline. And so we are still facing partly in the first half of the year about -- are not participating in some of the growth that others do because we have maintained a line as it relates to particularly structured credit, label, credit structures and addresses structures rather pricing. And so we are consistently doing that. We are not changing that and our credit books across our auto, mortgage, commercial remains consistent, we are not changing that either. So for us we\u2019re just maintaining our credit discipline, but yes, I mean, it is a very competitive place out there right now across the product and so we are seeing a little bit of that aggressiveness. We saw it in the quarters coming up we still see now although it\u2019s not worth.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line from Erika Najarian with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Good morning. My questions have all been asked and answered. Thank you.","Marianne Lake","","Thanks Erika.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","","Good morning.","Marianne Lake","","Good morning, Matt.","Jamie Dimon","","Good morning.","Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Can you remind us the timing of the private equity sale and how much capital against that. It was profitably a breakeven business, I think you know about 6 billion of outstanding and what does that mean in terms of freeing your capital in the Basel III and SLR?","Jamie Dimon","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve disclosed that. It hasn\u2019t been a breakeven business over a long period of time. Obviously hasn\u2019t earned much money in the last few quarters and we are still -- if we go and change something it could be soon. It won\u2019t be all of what we take, it will be a part of it. And then the part of the number you see, I think the $6 billion of total buyback are all heritage investments were made by JPMorgan Chase and et cetera before the Bank One merger.","Marianne Lake","","That will continue.","Jamie Dimon","","So, they are all eventually that $6 billion will be zero. And that frees up about $3 billion of equity capital respectively.","Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, $3 billion that\u2019s helpful. And then other commodities business you gave us the $2.8 billion of annual revenue give-up and said that was ROE dilutive but care to give expenses and capital against that?","Marianne Lake","Yeah, so, just to be clear the $3.8 billion if you go back and look at Investor Day was all of our business simplification agenda not the physical commodities. I just pulled out physical commodities as being A, a big piece of it; and B, us staying in the piece the biggest piece left to happen in 2014, so just to be clear on that. And then yes the $3.8 billion came with expenses of $3.2 billion again it, we didn\u2019t disclose the capital but when you take that into consideration it was at or below our cost of capital not additive to return.","Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then lastly this is probably an obvious question but the $100 million gain related to IPO would have been booked in the equity trading business when you are talking about the impact to the markets revenues?","Marianne Lake","Actually it didn\u2019t effect.","Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","","Okay, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But could you talk just a little bit about how much of the mortgage business cost are fixed and how much you would be willing to let the volume decline?","Marianne Lake","","Yeah, so we haven\u2019t actually broken out specifically in that way but I can characterize it for you. So obviously in mortgage production; the first you know chunk of expenses it\u2019s really variable meaning it\u2019s paying for production on a variable basis to the sales force and then you have a bunch of what we call semi-fixed cost which are effectively the operated, the people you know the sort of FTEs and then you do have pre-fixed cost which is the management, the real estate, the technology when you have a very, very slow market which I think you would agree at $1.1 trillion or lower market its very slow then it is hard with the fixed cost structure to make a lot of money in the mortgage business particularly if you are taking a hard line which we are on the types of mortgage product that we want to participate in but over time it doesn\u2019t stop the fact that this is going to be healthy company functioning mortgage market everyone to be [inaudible].","So it\u2019s tricky in this kind of very, very small market to but we are focused on fixing our fix cost base and trying to get out as much efficiency as possible.","Jamie Dimon","","And we have being spending a lot of time of that doing deep dives and trying to figure out and unfortunately this one won\u2019t be at the end of the year. I think it is hopefully by the end of 2015 we give you clear sight about how we would be making normal profitability there, ","Marianne Lake","","Right.","Jamie Dimon","Which may take until 2016.","Marianne Lake","","Yeah. And it would be in a technical volatile business and we had very, very strong performance over the quarter of 11 in \u201912, and into the first 2013 and we are now at that cyclical point, that cyclical node and we need a lot of things to happen but hopefully when I tell you that the fixed cost space is our number one process or among our number one processes and we are working very hard at it. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. So just of a small point, you mentioned a reserve release on the private student lending business. That was a business that you had kind of talked about potentially exiting I guess back in late last year. Is that still on the agenda or?","Jamie Dimon","We are not exiting, just no longer doing it, and it's in run-off mode.","Marianne Lake","Right. So we we stopped originating new loans but we do have a portfolio of loans that we are managing and as they run off we will experience usual charge off reserve releases they are not exiting.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Thanks. I have two questions. One is kind of a detailed question but I just want to make sure I understood correctly. You are talking about equity trading revenues and I think you sort of said the decline was attributable to the equity derivatives business. So can I imply that the year-on-year for cash and prime brokerage businesses were flat and all the decline came from equity derivatives is that what you said?","Marianne Lake","We said it was driven by derivatives, cash and prime brokerage, the better prime did the better than cash.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Okay. That's clear. And then just sort of a more conceptual question I look at your core loan growth of 4% obviously it was accommodated that\u2019s was very strong and I guess about two times the industry level and kind of reconciling that with the comments you made about C&I loan growth is kind of in-line when you are kind of ceding some market share in resi mortgage for all the reasons you have explained to us. So I was just wondering if you can give some color on those areas where you are clearly taking share and just some outlook on how sustainable that is or is it just kind of a good quarter?","Marianne Lake","So just on the mortgage thing we are giving up share but remember that we distribute a significant amount of mortgages that we produce. In this quarter we actually portfolioed $5 billion of mortgages. So we are not losing share in those. ","Derek De Vries - UBS","Yeah I understand.","Marianne Lake","So we are adding to the portfolio for mortgage it's slightly different dynamic. We are outperforming on sales prices in cards, so ultimately that would fuel outstanding growth that hopefully would be better than the industry but clearly it's modest at this point. I think we are inline if now potentially gaining a little share but we continue to outperform in real estate particularly in most real estate and asset management.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Okay. And so I mean all those areas are areas you are targeting so they should feel pretty sustainable?","Marianne Lake","","Yes.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Thanks very much. I just wanted to just step back for a moment and think about you know what's occurred in the context of the key themes from investor day last February. And it sounds like there is a couple of areas where things maybe are progressing bit more slowly than you thought. Mortgage it sounds maybe one of them but I wonder if in the context of the goals that you laid out how you feel broadly you are moving against them and whether there has been any real departures from your expectation sort of at the halfway point of the year?","Marianne Lake","So I think you called -- I think you called it well on mortgage. Obviously the mortgage market and housing conditions outside of [inaudible] are challenging and that looks like it\u2019s set to be a slower journey but if you step back and look at across all of our businesses when I talked about the underlying core performance drivers growing strongly that reflects our strategy. So we continue to build and grow our businesses demonstrated by those performance drivers as well as simplify and address the control agenda and we're making appropriate progress in both of those. And it showing in our results. I mean a quarter where obviously there are some challenges to print over 14 [inaudible] tangible common equity is evidence of the strategy workout.","And if you were to read through the comments I made in asset management we're investing in the sales force. We are seeing deliver growth. We have record inflows we are seeing international delivered loan growth, it's very consistent.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Yeah and I guess the\u2026","Jamie Dimon","We have given you a roadmap on how we are going to get from 7% return on tangible common equity to 14. We are already at 14.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Right. So I guess the I mean the real heart of my question is we look at these financial results which are clearly better than expectations against the backdrop which maybe is certainly not better, maybe worse than, than what we thought at the beginning of the year. And I wonder if that then suggests that in fact things are accelerating ahead of the timeline or in greater magnitude than the discussion in February. ","Jamie Dimon","No, I can\u2019t overemphasize this, we do not run the company for quarterly profits. We make long-term decisions on people, systems technology, products services, stuff like that and lot of things drive short term profits, but the profit you have in any one quarter relate to decision you made for the last five years and so we feel great about these companies. The big weak spot which we\u2019ll acknowledge is mortgage and we\u2019re going to put, we got great people there, we\u2019re going to put elbow to the metal there, we\u2019re going to invest some more money in their systems. We got some catch up to do, we got caught in the middle of as you know WaMu origination platforms and we usually look at each of these businesses they are all doing fine and we\u2019re looking at how we can grow them over the next five to ten years. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. ","I honestly I mean I don\u2019t care whether the FICC was up 10% or 15% or down 10% the next quarter. I actually think it\u2019s complete waste of time. ","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Okay and then maybe just lastly one of the themes from for this year has been the narrowing a little bit of the client base, based on risk of profitability profile. I'm just wondering how that\u2019s progressing particularly with respect maybe to the commercial bank?","Jamie Dimon","I think most of that\u2019s been done. So you\u2019ve seen, not all of it, but the full effect of that in terms of which segments we\u2019re gaining on, and which ones we\u2019re going to focus on, which ones we are putting hands to monitoring and it\u2019s sort of same thing in the CIB with our correspondent banking. There may be more, we are always going to do good housekeeping. There are some clients we\u2019ve had conversations with they are still on the books but they will be leaving down the road, but none of those things would be material to the future of this company. That may affect revenues a little bit in the fourth quarter or first quarter next year that\u2019s not why we\u2019re doing it. We\u2019re doing to protect ourselves, run the business properly meet our regulatory and control objectives. ","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","And so this is the last thing from me, but does that suggests that maybe we\u2019re getting closer to the point where the reported numbers in terms of the balance sheet, the loan expansion and the core numbers will get closer to converging?","Marianne Lake","Think about the core number advantage, reported number being primarily driven by the legacy mortgage and credit card portfolio. So the client activity that we\u2019ve been talking about is immaterial in the context of that run-off portfolio, that what\u2019s driving the difference.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Thanks very much. ","Marianne Lake","We will continue to see that portfolio run off and as it runs off and gets smaller we will have less of an impact but it\u2019s been fairly consistent story.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Great, thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. ","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Thanks good morning. On the consumer business just one last question about the payment side and we\u2019ve seen really good volume growth metrics and that\u2019s turned in the origination volumes, can you talk just about what you\u2019re seeing in the underlying customer as opposed to what you guys are benefiting from activation and on new car growth, just your general sense of the customer and spending?","Marianne Lake","Yes so we have a lot of market stats that while we maybe outperforming the market what we see is generally a fairly good picture of what\u2019s happening and what I can tell you is if you see compared to our growth you have still strong high single-digit growth in non-discretionary spend categories driven principally in growth in the space which is not all enterprising but I it\u2019s actually about consumer spending and inflation. And then if you look at the discretionary growth which is growing even more strongly though in the double-digit territory it\u2019s across the board, it\u2019s travel, it\u2019s restaurants, it\u2019s retail, it\u2019s across the board so consumers are spending very strongly in both categories. ","Jamie Dimon","And merchant processing we are growing like 12% a year and we\u2019re investing more money to do a better job for merchants there and so all of these things and $35 million people bank online I think it was 15 million who used mobile banking, it was 12 million to 15 million who used mobile banking. So you are going to see us extend products and services all of which hopefully will be merchant friendly and consumer friendly. ","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company","And on that merchant piece just can you just explain the disconnect between the volume side, continuing to look better and then the transaction growth rates slowing a little bit recently, is it a larger ticket size or is there some different underlying things in the metrics?","Jamie Dimon","","It\u2019s mostly merchants aggregating their transactions. ","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company","So it\u2019s flows through to you guys. ","Marianne Lake","Correct. ","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Okay great and then a little question, tax rate was a little low this quarter to your outlook generally speaking on the tax rate going forward? ","Marianne Lake ","Yes so I mean, our general longer term outlook is on our tax rate is 30% plus or minus, just given obviously the pretax prices of the 2014 market it will be slightly lower than that, more inline with the quarter. ","Jamie Dimon","I don\u2019t know if you mentioned this in other the private equity which was close to zero and bounces around is treasury and CIO which was close to zero, kind of will stay there, and there\u2019s other corporate, a normal rate would be around 200. This quarter is around 400 because of some of the tax benefits. Think of that as going back to 200 give or take next quarter for your models. ","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Perfect. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. ","Paul Miller - FBR","Yes. Thank you very much. I know a lot of questions have been asked, but I want to go back to mortgages a little bit the $16 billion, the market was up depending on who you listen to probably in the $260 billion to $300 billion range but you guys stayed relatively flat. And it looks like really you guys gave up market share with MBS issuance stuff that you sell to Fannie and Freddie and maybe you picked up more market share in the general market. Of the $5 billion that you portfolio, as you talked about was that all jumbos and you could talk a little bit about maybe stepping away from Fannie and Freddie?","Marianne Lake","So of the $5 billion, $3.6 million was jumbo, about $400 million was [inaudible] and then about a $1 billion of conventional. But that\u2019s high -- mostly jumbo, yes and we\u2019re holding share in jumbo. And with respect to the market share loss it was principally two things, it was principally a strategy that we\u2019ve talked about to do less in the high priced, high LTV, low FICO space and we priced to the risk adjusted return that we see in that business given the cost of service the loans that default and that\u2019s what the impact has been on our market share and then also the HARP burn out we were very successful in helping our loans over the course of last couple of years, our borrowers who are technically eligible are no longer responding. So we\u2019re seeing that burn out. ","The bit that\u2019s really truly the conventional loss which there was some, is really on price competition and we absolutely intend to compete on price.","Jamie Dimon","So our FHA volume was way down and we studied FHA and based upon the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that we\u2019ve lost a tremendous sum of money in FHA. We are trying to [inaudible] do better going forward. Just to give you three numbers, we collected $600 million of insurance, they disputed $200 million, the government called that a fraud. We reimbursed $600 million to get out of the lawsuit because it was a threatening lawsuit, even like in my opinion it was a commercial dispute between FHA and ourselves about that and the whole time FHA collected another $1.8 billion in premium. So the real question to me should we be in the FHA business at all and we\u2019re still struggling with that. ","We want to help the consumers there but we can\u2019t do it at great risk to JPMorgan. So until they come up with some kind of Safe Harbors or something we\u2019re going to be very, very cautious in that line of business.","Paul Miller - FBR","And Jamie a follow on question on your utilization comments, I thought was very good. But a lot of bankers have talked about as long as deposit is growing it\u2019s hard for their utilization rate to go up and we did see strong deposit growth and we\u2019re still seeing utilization rate. Should that deposit growth should start to go down if we are seeing an uptick in utilization rates?","Jamie Dimon"," ","I think it slowed down a little bit. ","Marianne Lake","Yeah, it went down slightly in commercial.","Jamie Dimon","And last remember there are so many different borrowers in industry so there might be some people are still accumulating deposits or some start to borrow money but in general you\u2019re right. ","Marianne Lake","Yeah so if you look at commercial just as an illustration of your point what we\u2019ve got going on is the utilization rate in the last two quarters have picked up by 33% still much, much lower than you would expect them to be overtime which would be probably about 40% but you do see deposits flattening out in fact there\u2019s a little bit of decline. It\u2019s not absolutely the case at this point that we can say people are starting to spend their deposits and utilize their lines and I think -- is still not really out there but that is what you\u2019d expect in this business we didn\u2019t see strong growth in deposits. ","Paul Miller - FBR","Okay, thank you very much guys. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. ","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Hi good morning. So Marianne I actually had a question about the presentation that you\u2019d given last month at the Morgan Stanley conference. You alluded to a targeted loan to deposit ratio of roughly 70% through the cycle and I supposed I was wondering when crunching some of the numbers given the proper treatment for loans versus high quality securities under the LCR, whether there is a peak level of loan to deposit ratio or growth that we should think about given the constraints, which exist under the new liquidity regime. ","Marianne Lake","","So first of all just to make a competitive point with it, we didn\u2019t have a target to loan to deposit we were just trying to make the point that obviously as we think forward to the impact of interest rates on our performance overtime we would expect both a mix shift in deposits back towards interest earning MCDs but also expect to see the economy growing and loan growing and that needed to be taken into consideration. So it wasn\u2019t really a target, it was just a simulation to start with that. It was basically on levels that we have seen at least in parts of the cycle that we were referring to. And then you are right, there is a dynamic where because of LTR we will always have because of our liquidity requirements internal as well we will have liquid assets that will be structurally higher than they would have previously been. And therefore from a mix effect that would have an impact but at this point given where loans to deposits are I think that would be a high class problem to be talking about. ","Jamie Dimon","","And remember there are some unused lines, there is no loans in the balance sheet they still need a 100% LCR. So what\u2019s really going to happen is, it\u2019s going to be on decline level, capital LCR, commitments et cetera, we just have to manage it, at the capital level, the desk level et cetera.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Thanks, actually that\u2019s a great transition for my next question, which relates to pricing in some of the multiple binding constraints on capital that exists today. And some of the discussions that we had with your competitors have suggested that some believe that it\u2019s still a little bit too early to fully bake in the cost of managing to all the different capital real stats that exist today, whether it\u2019s risk based leverage based or even CCAR and it appears that you have been managing more actively through all the different constraints out there and in light of that I was wondering whether you have seen any impact for more aggressive pricing by peers in terms of your relative market share in certain product areas, particularly within the CIB?","Jamie Dimon","","We see a little bit of this trade finance costs have gone up, a little bit in municipal businesses and there you have seen a little more restructuring of the type of business people do. Remember some of the repricing may not take place in the product. It may take place in the relationship because all products have lost leaders et cetera but we haven\u2019t seen a huge amount of repricing taking place yet.","Marianne Lake","","And I think if you think about\u2026","Jamie Dimon","","I have heard some complaints by the way that some of the revolvers are smaller and shorter, not the price as much of it is the sizing and then you\u2019ve heard some commentary in the market that inventories bonds are lower and being gapped out, spreads are gapped out, so you\u2019re trying to see some of it but eventually I have never seen a business where the costs of goods sold doesn\u2019t eventually get priced in the business. It doesn\u2019t happen to be priced into the egg or the milk, it just has to be priced in the transaction the whole bag, the person walks out to the supermarket would.","Marianne Lake","","And I think one way to look at it is to say well we are absolutely managing through this complex environment Basel III Tier I comments still is our binding constraint at the moment and that\u2019s how we allocate capital in the businesses and that\u2019s the sort of primary lend that we are using to price and what you are going to see as Jamie talked about is that the leverage and LTR and other constraints including stressed capital are going to play out at the client level as we just all are becoming more efficient about how we deploy our balance sheet, rather than necessarily a re-pricing strategy. ","Jamie Dimon","","And CCAR we will push the CCARs down to the extent we can we will push the CCAR down -- those things which create CCARness.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Thanks and I suppose could you give potentially any context as to what event may prompt that repricing, whether even if the leverage rules are finalized and officially implemented this year do you expect that\u2019s when you will begin to see a lot of your peers begin to reprice some of these effects into their inventory or into their trading securities or is it -- are they likely going to delay at least the repricing until the rules are fully implemented which is, going to be a 2018 event?","Jamie Dimon","","I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath, I mean some people leaving businesses, some optimize the decline levels, some are having strategic changes and it will happen overtime and we are quite patient about it. We are in no rush. We are not going to try to lead it or anything like that, it will happen overtime. As I said you have seen it in trade finance, you\u2019ve seen in municipal businesses, you have seen it in - I know the rules aren\u2019t final, when the rules become final then people may react differently.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","All right, great. That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Jamie Dimon","","You\u2019re welcome.","Marianne Lake","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the SLR. It seems like the improvement you had sequentially was I think mostly driven by capital in the preferred issuance. Can you give us sort of where we are in terms of compression trades and the impact is it still more a lot more to come or is that mostly in there and then I guess any thoughts or updates on [exactly] what impact can be and if you expect that to be adopted by the fed?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, just on the -- yes, the improvement at the bank and the holding company was retained earnings, plus capital attribution but we continue to work through all of the other initiatives we have to optimize leverage including compression trades and pay-offs and the like. That is actually happening a little bit more slowly than we have thought just broadly in the industry it still presents an opportunity if not the most sizeable opportunity but we are diligently getting after it. ","And then with respect to SCAR we estimate it in clearly it\u2019s the complex calculation so we will be slightly wrong in our estimate. We estimated it to have a benefit to the firm of 35 points and for the bank of 45 points. Yes we would expect that at some point it will be ultimately adopted by the U.S. regulators but that doesn\u2019t look likely to be helping our numbers this year or next.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, got you. And then maybe just I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s not related or not but if I looked at your derivatives receivable on the balance sheet it\u2019s been declining pretty steadily down 20% year-on-year. Is that reflective of just demand or given low volatility and low activity levels or is there something structural there, are you guys actively managing your receivables down or just trying to get a sense you know how much the cyclical versus structural argument?","Marianne Lake","It\u2019s substantially cyclical.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay.","Marianne Lake","","I mean I wish we could be -- I wish we could actively manage it down because it\u2019s part of our part of our (inaudible) calculation but the truth of the matter is a factor of activity level.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, it\u2019s primary activity levels. Okay. And one last one on the CDO question, I think earlier I think we saw Citigroup settle with DOJ regarding in the included CDOs I don\u2019t your settlement included that. Is that something that you think all remains out there or just something unique to them, I know you have you did settle one, one complaint with the SEC a few years ago just want to get a sense of how you think about that any remaining litigation risk around CDOs? Thanks.","Marianne Lake","We don\u2019t think it\u2019s significant.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research"," ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley"," ","Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up Jamie on the FAJ commentary you had. I\u2019m just wondering about the implications for how you hit the CRA requirements. Is there any interplay there?","Jamie Dimon","","Yes, the CRA number is a combination of lower and middle income mortgages. So we will obviously try to meet to those commitments, it include how many branches you have in lower-middle income so we\u2019ll continue to build that. It\u2019s a function of CDFI like lending to small business or community development funds which we will continue to do. So it runs a whole gamut and we will meet our CRA commitment. Yes if you don\u2019t do any FHA that hurts you a little bit but to do FHA and lose billions of dollars that\u2019s a whole different level of shareholder responsibility and so we have got to be very careful how we handle that.","I\u2019m hoping FHA comes forth and comes up with some real bright lines and harbors that make it easy for us to try to do what the government wants us to do, but we can\u2019t get penalized severely for some of the things that happen.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley"," ","Doing in the FHA you have got the Ginnie\u2019s to their 4-year RWAs were lower, doing -- getting the same credit for CRA and loans is obviously a little bit more capital consumptive so that\u2019s part of the challenge?","Jamie Dimon","","It\u2019s all of that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley"," ","Yes, okay.","Jamie Dimon","We are going to meet CRA. We report CRA results every month and like I said it cuts across a wide variety of things that we do for people. We just did this great thing at Detroit that lots of CRA credits. We can do mortgages ourselves that we can put on balance sheet that we think are less risky than FHA, insurance so we will figure it out. This is just a category we just thoroughly, thoroughly confused about how we got treated, how we got to do it going forward and what kind of -- and we\u2019ve spoken to government for some kind of guidance going forward.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley"," ","Great. So this is on the reps and warranties on the FHA?","Jamie Dimon","","Yes.","Marianne Lake","","Well it\u2019s still\u2026","Jamie Dimon","","It\u2019s the reps and warrants that there should be a commercial resolution dispute we don\u2019t have [triple damages] if something goes wrong.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you operator and good morning everyone. And just to let you know that Jamie is actually on the ride with clients today, so he's not able to join us this morning, but sends his regards.","So, now I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.7 billion, EPS of $2.37, and a return on tangible common equity of 19% on revenue of $28.5 billion, benefiting from broad based strength in performance, but also lower taxes and seasonality.","So, this quarter's performance in context, on a core basis pretax earnings grew 13% year-on-year, benefiting from higher rate, solid growth across other revenue drivers, and continued investments in our businesses. And even excluding the benefit of tax reform, net income was a clear record this quarter.","Included in the results, you see on the page, approximately $500 million of mark-to-market gains on certain investments previously held at cost due the adoption of a new accounting standard. These gains are reported in CIB markets revenue.","Against that, there were a number of other smaller, but nevertheless notable items, including changes in credit reserve, SBA, investment securities, and private equity losses and legal, which together substantially offset those gains.","Underlined results continue to be strong. Average core loan growth excluding the CIB of 8% year-on-year, Card sales and merchant processing volumes up 12% and 15% respective. We maintained our number one rank in global IB fees and have net income of $1 billion in the Commercial Bank. And in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw strong long-term flows [ph] across all regions and 10% AUM growth.","Turning to page two, some more details about the first quarter results. So, before we get into the numbers on the performance drivers for the quarter, I do want to remind you that there have been a couple of adjustments to the numbers on the page which are in line with the guidance that we gave during the fourth quarter.","First, seeing the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. You will recall, this will have the full year impact of grossing up non-interest revenue and expense each by approximately $1.2 billion. The impact for the quarter of about $300 million is included here and prior periods have been similarly restated.","Second, as a result of tax reform, certain tax equivalent adjustments that are included in managed revenue are lower on a relative basis and for that prior periods have not being restated. This impact which was also about $300 million for the quarter, reduced revenues, was split about 50\/50 in NII versus NIR, an offset in tax expense.","So, with that, revenue of $28.5 billion was up $2.7 billion or 10% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $1.1 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates. Non-interest revenue was up $1.6 billion year-on-year and while it includes the mark-to-market gains on the first page, it also includes approximately $400 million of losses on investment securities and legacy private equity investments.","Adjusted expense of $16 billion was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth including Auto lease depreciation. Credit cost of $1.2 billion were down $150 million year-on-year. Consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and guidance and there were no changes to reserves this quarter. In wholesale, we had a net reserve release of about $170 million driven by single Oil & Gas names.","You'll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter ended a little above 18% compared to the 17% guidance we gave, driven by a combination of higher pretax earnings as well as geographical mix. We're expecting full year effective tax rate to be closer to 20%.","Shifting to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the first quarter with CET1 of 11.8%, down about 30 basis points versus last quarter. Capital generated was offset by net capital distributions and changes in AOCI. So, the reduction was driven by higher risk weighted assets reflecting the increased level of market activity, which similarly impacted all other ratios.","In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and last week, we submitted our 2018 CCAR Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. But as you know, we can't provide any details of that at this stage.","So, before moving on to the lines of business, on page four, I'll briefly address this week's new capital news. Two new capital NPRs were released this week, the Stress Capital Buffer and eSLR. Starting with the Stress Capital Buffer, the proposal was broadly in line with a narrative and expectations that had been set.","There is a comment period, we intend to fully participate in the process and are encouraged that there is an openness from current leadership to really consider feedback from the industry.","On the positive side, we support the convergence of Stress and BAU capital and in general, support simplification of the framework. We believe that firm should be required to hold adequate capital to withstand severe stress, calibrated to firm's specific exposures and risks. We also agree that many of the changes to the construct of the test, for example, not having to hold capital for full distributions during a stress environment, better reflect reality, and Board-approved policies.","That said, stepping right back, if we are fundamentally reconsidering the contrast of minimum capital levels, then all of the building blocks should be in play including the GSIB surcharge to ensure they all hang together. And to reinforce points that we previously made, first and foremost, the fixed coefficients need to be recalibrated in light of the economic growth we've had. Second, the underlying premise for the surcharge and more particularly, U.S. gold plating is somewhat unnecessary for a firm that is compliant with all of the post-crisis reform that directly addresses systemic risks, which includes the severity of the CCAR stress, incorporating material GSIB specific instructions.","Beyond that, obvious challenges with the current proposal includes the significant volatility and opacity in the said results, as well as challenges around implementation. So, getting to the numbers, you can see on the page, our estimated historical Stress Capital Buffer derived from the said result. And while for 2017, it would imply no impact on our minimum capital levels, you can see that in years prior, the buffer would have been higher. And you know that in 2018, the scenario was in many ways more severe and the lower tax rate has a net negative bias.","Further there will potentially be a need for larger management buffers if it is necessary to accommodate significant volatility. So, acknowledging everything that we don't know, it's fair to say that our minimum level of capital including a management buffer would likely be higher under this proposal, but likely still in the range of 11% to 12%.","Briefly on eSLR, as you know, we are not currently bound by leverage. I'm trying to say to you this proposal would reduce the eSLR minimum. So, my primary comment on this is to reiterate my earlier comments about the need to be willing to reexamine the GSIB surcharge regardless of the fact that it reduces the number. Overall, we've been waiting for these proposals and we look forward to participating in the comment process.","Moving to page five and let's start with Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $3.3 billion of net income and an ROE of 25%. Core loans are up 8% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 13%, Business Banking up 7%, Card up 5%, and Auto loans and leases up 6%.","Deposits grew solidly at 6% year-on-year. We believe we continue to outpace the industry, which as we previously noted, is experiencing a slowdown as consumers are increasing their allocations to investments, but also based upon our data, they appear to be spending more, reflecting a continued high level of confidence.","Client investment assets were up 13% year-on-year with half of the growth from net new money flows and with record flows this quarter. And active mobile users were up double-digit.","Revenue of $12.6 billion was up 15% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was roughly flat, as portfolio loan spread and production margin compression were predominantly offset by higher net servicing revenue.","And Card, Merchant Services, and Auto revenue was up 18% including higher Auto lease income, but it was driven by Card on lower net acquisition costs, higher loan balances as well as margin expansion. The Card revenue rate was 11.6% in the quarter.","Expense of $6.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by investments in technology and marketing. Higher Auto lease depreciation and continued underlined business growth. The overhead ratio of 55% was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite seasonally higher payroll taxes and higher marketing expenses.","Finally, on credit, the trends across our portfolio remain favorable. Charge offs were driven by Card and were in line with guidance and there were no reserve actions taken this quarter. Recall, last year included a net impact of a little over $200 million related to the student loan portfolio sale.","Turning to page six and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion and an ROE of 22%. This quarter in Banking, we maintained our number one ranking a global IBCs as well as a number one rank in North America and EMEA. IBCs were $1.7 billion, down 10% from a record quarter last year and strong performance in M&A was more than offset by lower debt and equity underwriting fees.","Advisory fees were up 15% year-on-year as we saw good momentum and some large deal closed. We ranked number one in global M&A wallet and gained share in every region. And for the quarter, we announce and completed more deals than any other bank.","Equity underwriting fees were down 19% in a market that was also down and versus a strong first quarter last year, which included a number of large deals. This quarter we ranked number three in a very competitive environment.","And debt underwriting fees were down 18%, driven by a slow start to the year, primarily due to increased market volatility which reduced issuance. Despite these headwinds, we maintained our number one ranking globally and looking forward to the rest of the year, across products, the overall pipeline remains strong.","Moving onto market, total markets revenue was $6.6 billion, up 13% year-on-year reported. However, as mentioned, this includes the mark-to-market gains we called out on the front page and also includes a reduction of about $150 million reflecting lower tax equivalent adjustments year-on-year. Accounting for both of these items market revenues would have been up about 7%.","Fixed income market's adjusted revenue was flat versus a strong first quarter last year with rates and spread markets reversing to more normal levels following significant outperformance last year, being offset by strong emerging markets and commodities performance.","It was a record quarter for equities and revenue was up 25%. A well-diversified story driven by broad strength and continued momentum throughout the quarter with increased volatility benefiting all of equity derivatives. In addition, we saw share gains in cash and continue client activity driving growth in prime as the investments that we've made the business are paying off.","Treasury Services and Security Services revenue were both $1.1 billion for the quarter and up 14% and 16% respectively, driven by higher rates and balances. Security Services also benefited from asset based fee growth on both market levels and new client activity.","Finally, expense of $5.7 billion was up 9% year-on-year, half being higher compensation expense with a comp-to-revenue ratio of 29% and the remainder primarily driven by higher transaction costs in markets.","Moving to Commercial Banking on page seven. Another very good quarter in this business with net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII as we continue to benefit from higher rates, partially offset by lower IB revenues.","Sequentially, revenue was down 8%, largely driven by the impact of tax reform. Gross IB revenues of $569 million result 15% year-on-year on a lower overall industry wallet and fewer large transactions versus last year. That said, the underlying flow of business remains robust. In fact, it was a record quarter for middle market clients and the pipeline looked strong.","Expense of $844 million was up year-on-year as we continue to invest in the business, both in bankers and technology. Loan balances were up 6% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 5% on strength in our expansion markets as well as specialized industries, but down 1% sequentially roughly in line with the industry.","CRE loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter as the competition is significantly elevated.","So both, while client sentiment is high in the wake of corporate tax reform and we remain hopeful that this will support higher demand later in the year, we're not seeing that yet and we are maintaining pricing and credit discipline. Finally, credit performance continues to be very good with zero net charge offs this quarter.","Moving onto Asset & Wealth Management on page eight, Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $770 million with a pretax margin of 26% and an ROE of 34%. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposit margin expansion and loan growth.","Expense of $2.6 billion was down year-on-year as the first quarter of last year included nearly $400 million of legal expenses. Adjusted expense would have been up 8%, driven by higher external fees and revenues as well as higher compensation.","For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $16 billion including $5 billion in active equities with strength across all regions benefiting from strong long-term performance. We saw net liquidity outflows of $21 billion, largely driven by a combination of recent M&A activity and the impacts of cash repatriation due to tax reform.","AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 10% and 9% respectively on high market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting the migration into investments which we previously discussed, but were about flat sequentially on seasonally higher balances. Finally, we had record loan balances up 12% with strength in both mortgage as well as other loans globally.","Moving to page nine and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $383 million. The net loss of $1.87 million in treasury and CIO was primarily due to losses related to security sales. The net loss of $196 million in other Corporate reflects approximately $100 million after-tax loss on legacy private equity investments, as well as a net tax expense on adjustments and true-up of certain reserves. And you'll recall that last year included a legal benefit and our quarter, of course, included the impact of tax reform.","Finally, turning the page 10. Given Investor Day is only six weeks behind us, we've not changed our guidance for the full year 2018. So, to wrap-up, we are pleased with the firm's performance this quarter with all of our businesses showing continued and broad strength in an overall environment that remains supportive. And while acknowledging the tailwinds of tax reform and higher rates, the consistent performance of business drivers is translating into topline growth and positive operating leverage with revenues and pretax income both up double-digits year-on-year.","So, with that operator, we can take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly ma'am. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning Marianne. Wanted to talk about LIBOR, we saw big increase this quarter, can you remind us how LIBOR affects you, kind of pros and cons, where do you have LIBOR sensitivity on the asset side and where do you have it on the funding cost sensitivity to LIBOR? And how should we think net-net about that?","Marianne Lake","Yes. Okay, so I'll sort of end with the op shop [ph] which is that net-net the impact to our results in the quarter was very modest positive. So, a pretty small number on the positive direction. And we've actually seen this before, I can't remember, a year or so ago, we are most sensitive as you know to the front-end of rate, but principally to IOER and prime.","So, while we do have exposure to LIBOR repricing, it's both on the asset and liability. As you mentioned, we also have combination of one month and three months LIBOR. So, if you look sort of next across the assets and liability side, they material offset, we don't have sort of significant mismatches. And so as a consequence, obviously, we benefit from a higher level of obsolete short rate, but the basis widening hasn't been very meaningful to our NII. And I mean examples of asset that we price of LIBOR be the Commercial Banking loans and obviously, unhedged or hedged long-term debt on the liability side.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, wondering about the drivers of the 7% expected growth in fee income for this year. At Investor Day, you mentioned you've got some bounce back from headwinds in Card and markets, but also core growth of -- I think about $2.5 billion you mentioned. So, what are the drivers of that overall 7% fee income if you could just give us some color there that would be great?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, let's start with sort of three relatively big drivers. So, yes, as we have now sort of latched big Sapphire reserves and high premium vintages, our net acquisition costs are substantially lower and so that is a tailwind. We are seeing regular way BAU growth in Cards, NIR, and -- sort of drivers.","Similarly, mark-to-markets as we talked about after the first quarter performance that's a driver and then as the ongoing sort of growth in the Auto lease income space which is significant. Outside of that, you look at our underlying drivers across the Board in terms of new accounts and debit trends in Card sales and Asset Management fees as a driver too, so there's obviously a level of market dependency to it, but a bit of the sort of outsized year-on-year increase is seeing the -- somewhat tailwind of Card and market, both in the trading and in the Asset Management base.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much.","Marianne Lake","Hey Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hello. There's a comment in the prepared text on -- in Lending and Commercial banking being intensely competitive and led to no real growth. Yet, I saw your -- the comments about 5% and 7% C&I growth and CRE growth, so I wonder if you could just flush that out a little bit more about the competitive landscape and I guess that's a pricing issue mostly?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I'll start with year-over-year, we're still getting significant benefits from our investment and expansion markets and also as you know we had a pretty -- we have a pretty unique sort of offering in terms of first term lending and so, for a period of time in both of those bases, we've been materially outperforming the market and so we're still seeing the benefit of that in our year-over-year numbers.","Quarter-over-quarter -- and the trouble with C&I loans is there can also be some volatility associated with held-to-sell mortgage portfolio, seasonality -- sorry mortgage warehouse seasonality and stuff like that. So, quarter-over-quarter what we're seeing is just the impact of the sort of overall industry-wide slowdown and the fact that you're right, it's not just pricing, it's just generally we continue to be very selective and cautious given where we are in the cycle, but we're not expecting flat for the year, we're expecting growth in the mid-single-digits for the year and we still believe that there should be demand.","And in the CTL space and commercial real estate [ph] more generally that's where the competition really has stepped up very significantly and that really is where pricing has become fiercely competitive and that's in compression.","Glenn Schorr","Thanks. And I just want to quick follow-up on your other comments related to capital proposals. The simple question I have is hearing you loud and clear on the -- on everything related to risk based capital, but the clear improvement on the leverage side in the SLR, does that -- theoretically I know that's just a proposal right now, would that theoretically free up more activity in repo land and other short-term investments that soak-up leverage capital but not risk -- much risk-based capital?","Marianne Lake","So, generally across the -- sort of whole industry, I suspect the answer to the question is yes, but remember for us that we haven't been constrained by leverage -- Tier 1 leverage or SLR over the last -- over the last several years. And it's a result obviously of the business mix we have and operating model that we have that we can socialize some of our [Indiscernible] results across the company and so we wouldn't expect there are the hedges [ph] and change materially.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.","Michael Mayo","Hi.","Marianne Lake","Hi.","Michael Mayo","Can you just give a little bit more of your expectations for consumer and specifically digital banking? The active online users were up 5% year-over-year, but for the quarter, it was up 12% annualized. And I know there's always risk in annualizing numbers, so is that change in online users seasonal or is it structural, just a little more color on that?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, I'll give you my best thought. I would say it's a little bit more structural than it is seasonal and we've been seeing continued growth in both digital and especially, the mobile channels. And it's a lot to do with adding features and as we talked about at Investor Day, making it compelling for people to digitally move money, which makes them become much more engaged in all of the good things that come with that.","In addition we talked also I think at Investor Day about the fact that we've recently added digital account opening and so I couldn't give you exact amounts of what is driving -- which ones of those is driving what, but we would continue to expect a bit of a structural acceleration. Certainly we hope for that.","Michael Mayo","And then a follow-up on that. So, is this money stickier or not? And if you could elaborate more on the deposit base, I know you've been pretty cautious in saying that money could flee more easily because of the digital it goes, on other hands, does it become more sticky because you have these connections?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I think we sort of talked about the fact that -- I did think those customers are more loyal that they spend more and they bring up more deposits in investment. So, we gave you the stat -- that I think at Investor Day, we see more Card spend both debit and credit, but we also see higher deposits and investment, so digitally active customers. So, overall, it's really good for our franchise to have these customers engaged and we hope they also use our branches by the way.","With respect to deposit status, we talked before about the two theses. The first which is the one that we generally subscribe to is that a combination of the ability to use technology, the transparency, and expectation of higher rates as well as potentially overtime, the value of retail deposits the liquidity that we would expect higher reprice. And we haven't changed our expectation on that, but we haven't seen it yet either. So, we're going to have to watch that maybe play out.","There is the other side of that argument that other people -- many people subscribe to which is the customer experience, investments, the convenience, the brand, the marketing, the digital features, the products and services, the reward, all become increasingly important and customers are less price-sensitive.","So, I guess we'll all know it when it finally unfolds. As you know we could have taken a little bit more of a conservative view but where we are right now in the normalization cycle specifically, sort of retail, checking, and savings, as you know we haven't yet seen that unfold.","We have seen migration in Asset, Wealth Management balances and that to be expected to be a leading indicator. So, this will unfold over the course of the next year or so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Marianne Lake","Hey Matt.","Matthew O'Connor","Hi, good morning. Can you provide an update on your interest rate sensitivity with the recent move in rates that we've had?","Marianne Lake","I'm sorry, say again.","Matthew O'Connor","Just an update on your interest rate sensitivity from here?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, we've seen two things happen. I guess we've seen obviously we've rolled forward a quarter. I think our earnings at risk disclose at the end of last quarter was $1.7 billion, you go forward a quarter and that comes down a little less sort of realized rate benefit, but we've also seen as you know somewhere in the sort of mid 40s basis point increase in rates sort of front and long end which will also have a somewhat significant impact. So, $1.7 billion will be down quite meaningfully I would expect at the end of the third quarter, but you'll see those disclosures in our Q.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. And then just separately within the trading businesses not a surprise there's a big increase in the average VAR, obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the number of products out there or the markets out there. But just anyway to think about like how much the VAR increased? And you had some increase in trading revenues, but maybe not as much as one would think when you see the VAR that much, is there any correlation between those two from [Indiscernible] point of view?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I think it's extremely difficult to draw a straight line between VAR and all of its complexities and revenues in any one quarter. And if I just sort of unpick it for you first -- and by the way, just to reiterate that it's still at relatively low levels relative to historical norms when we've been in more normal trading environments with higher levels of volatility and inventory and the like.","So, I would handpick and say of the increase more than half was related to volatility and obviously some of the volatility was somewhat significant, we wouldn't necessarily expect to see that level continue, albeit that we would expect to continue see periods or episodes of significant volatility and a bit less than half to do with positions principally, but not exclusively as a result of higher levels of client activity in the CIB any sort of balance sheet wants to go up and risk weighted assets and so on.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Hi Erika.","Erika Najarian","Morning. So, my first question to you Marianne is if the Stress Capital Buffer becomes final as proposed and now the industry has a BAU CET1 minimum that could move year-to-year, how does that change your outlook on how to think about dividends and buybacks from here?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, I mean I would start a little bit with -- so when you say as return, if you take the last years Stress Capital Buffer, you've seen this from history for us that that could be significant. So, there are three observations I would have. The first is when we think about capital planning, I think rightly you would expect us and we do think about over more than a one year cycle and while we have very significant earnings capacity, we don't want to be sort of up and down and sideways and [Indiscernible].","So, I think there will be some implications of the potential for volatility in the calibration of management buffers. And so whether it's in higher or lower SCB or whether it has to be taken into consideration so that we aren\u2019t caught sideways from a test result that is with respect once a year and a little bit opaque.","The second thing I would highlight to you is for what it's worth, you saw our Investor Day sort of, I won't say guidance, but no sort of indication that we were -- we would expect to try and pay out around 100% off of minus. And you see our ratios are below 12%. So, I think that puts us on reasonably solid booking regardless of the precision of it to sort of understand how the rules play out.","Finally, I hope and I believe, I suspect that through the comment period, the implications of volatility will be properly explored and that hopefully there will be some sort of mechanism considered to accommodate smooth or otherwise allow for things not to be [Indiscernible] around based upon the specificity of the test.","And margin, I guess, the fourth point, it's not something that we overthink is having the full course of dividend explicitly included notwithstanding that this cap [ph] is listed kind of makes it dollar-to-dollar capital. So, at the margin, I guess that makes people think carefully, but we would still want to pay out a strong healthy dividend on growing earnings.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And my follow-up question, I wanted to follow-up to your response to Glenn's question on SLR. I think there was some excitement from your investors if you look at your 4Q banking sub SLR, I think it was 6.7% off of a 6% minimum and that would clearly go to 4.75%. But just to make sure I understood your response even if you could add low risk weight exposure according to that constraint that leverage exposure feeds into the size component of the GSIB surcharge calculation. And so for there to be more freed balance sheet, you also really need to recalibrate the GSIB surcharge. Did they get that?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I mean that's definitely one of the factors. But just the other sort of slightly first order factor is we're running 70 basis points above our minimum. So, if you reduce the minimum by another 100 or 200 basis points whatever the number is, we already had excess capacity. And so when we think about the use of our resources, we obviously think about to maximize SCA [ph]. And so we haven't felt extraordinarily constrained I would say.","So, there's that kind of just sort of basic, we haven't been maybe as constrained as maybe others have seen and that is what it is. And so while we'll continue to make every decision incrementally based upon marginal SCA, but you are right. You have to take into consideration all the local impacts, I mean our stock price alone impacts GSIB.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning Marianne","Marianne Lake","Good morning Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Question on LIBOR, I know you discussed it relative to the loan book, I'm wondering if you could give us some color on how the LIBOR changes impacted trading?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so look, I would say that in the fixed income spaces was sort of discussion and it was a feature or a factor and even in equities, to be honest, it was part of the discussions. I wouldn't say that we could point to it materially impacting our failing results.","Betsy Graseck","And then the follow-up is just on the mark-to-market gains that you called out the $505 million [ph]. It looks to me like you've called it out as mark-to-market gains on certain equity investments. I just wanted to understand why it's really showing up in fixed income instead of equity trading line, is that the correct interpretation of the slide?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, think about -- many of these investments are years old -- many years old. And think about them as strategic investments that relate to business activity. For example, if illustratively in financial market infrastructure or clearing and houses or exchanges or so on, all sales and strategic investment potentially related to other parts of the business, so it just happens to be the case that those investments years ago relate and continue to relate to fixed income more than equities. And they were previously ahead of cost, and as there are observable prices as you know this quarter we have to reflect that.","Operator","Our next question--","Marianne Lake","Pretty [Indiscernible] with the investment.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Hey good morning. Maybe just a question on the TCGA [ph], I know that we're all wondering if it's going to have an impact on loan growth, but what about credit, do you think that that has any positive impact, I guess, particularly on the Corporate side with higher cash flows going forward lower tax rate. How do you think about reserving and your expected loss rates going forward?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I would say across the Board actually all the way from full business to middle market, we're expecting sort of higher earnings more free cash and generally speaking, that would improve the sort of credit quality of the portfolio. And we will only really see that come through as we get financials and see that in the financials and label to reflect that in our internal ratings. But we would expect to see some positive lift as a result of that over time.","So, no doubt that helps, but it helps in a rising rate environment and it looks pluses and minuses, but yes, it's a tailwind to credit overall.","James Mitchell","Right, okay. Thanks. And then maybe just following up on asset yields, you saw overall asset yields jump pretty nicely given the higher rate environment, but securities portfolio yields were down, is that sort of a shortening duration or just a mix issue, what shouldn\u2019t we expect security sales people moving higher in this environment?","Marianne Lake","Yes you should. What it is actually is the tax equivalent adjustments I mentioned. So, you're seeing that sort of relative impact of lower tax gross-ups and meaning portfolio and investment securities, if you were to adjust to that, they would have been up in line with rates.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Hey Marianne you mentioned that on the consumer side, you had no incremental reserving actions and I'm wondering if you can just kind of give us a state of the consumer to that extent is -- are you feeling just better or was it also related to kind of just the growth math starting to look a little bit better in Card and Auto?","Marianne Lake","So, I would say we still feel really good about the consumer, really good. And so while you can look at sort of overall sort of levels of consumer indebtedness and look at the fact that they've reached the peak and student lending is driving that in a large part. It's also clearly the case that people had a long time to prepare their balance sheets and term out debt at lower rates and become more liquid and so sort of debt service burdens are still manageable.","And so over -- and confidence is high and that should be a benefit generally speaking. So, overall, we still feel pretty good and it's showing a little bit in our sort of consumer spend data where we're seeing that confidence continues to sort of a spur a bit in spending. With respect to reserves, so our expectation and our belief about the strength of consumer continues to be optimistic. And then further, of course, you know that our portfolio particularly is skewed towards higher quality credit. And so we aren't seeing any signs of fragility or deterioration across the portfolios across the Board. So, hope you get it.","Kenneth Usdin","Got it. And on my follow-up, the Card revenue rate was nice to see it really spike up 11.6% and you guys have been talking about getting it to 11.25% by mid-year. Any updated thoughts on just that trajectory and where you expect that to go over time now?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I mean much like we talked about with the Card charge off, right, there is some seasonality. So, the first quarter revenue rate would normally be seasonally higher. Having said that, you're right, we did see some revenue outperformance in the Card space a little bit. And so at this point if you were to ask me 11.25, well, it's it certainly a very, very solid expectation, probably higher for the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Marianne Lake","Hi.","Operator","Mr. Martinez, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hello. Can you hear me?","Marianne Lake","Yes, we can hear.","Saul Martinez","Could you hear me? I'm sorry about that. Sorry little scattered this morning, I have a lot going on. But -- yes, I apologize if you already addressed this question Marianne. But -- can you just talk to the -- how you're feeling about the pipeline in investment banking, obviously it was a little bit of a soft quarter for you and for everybody. And just how are you thinking about the pipeline deal activity in light of Daniels, I think Daniels' guidance at the Investor Day, your expectation is that Advisory and ECM might be up a little bit, ECM down a little bit, I don't know if you guys have any updated thoughts on the outlook?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I mean I just -- first of all, I would just talk a tiny bit about the quarter because I think it's important and it's instructive. First of all, last quarter was a -- this quarter last year, I'm sorry, was a record and so not that we don't always want to [Indiscernible] I still feel like we did pretty well and it's a little bit like the fixed income story last year, equity market in DCM was up and M&A was less strong in this year that turned around and I would say as we look at the results in ECM and DCM that were down, there were a few -- we were under indexed for the larger fee event for a combination of reasons; some outside of our control and some addressable and also some deals that we had hoped to have closed moved into the second quarter, which is all to say that actually if you look across the Board, M&A still look strong, DCM and ECM pipeline also looks strong. Overall, the pipeline is well ahead of this time last year.","So, as long as the market remains constructive, we should continue to see reasonable momentum across products, but as you say, the [Indiscernible] M&A and equities likely to benefit more strongly than DCM in a rate rise environment.","And so confidence is strong, activity levels, you saw volumes are up. We printed number one M&A quarter. So, as long as market volatility regularity given is gone certainty, doesn't escalate within any pretty good about the second quarter and into the year.","Saul Martinez","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning Marianne.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you give us any color on when you look at your franchise -- your consumer franchise, is there parts of the country that are more competitive for deposits, whether that's metro New York versus California versus Texas? And could you give us some color on what you guys are seeing geographically on deposit growth in the competition?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I mean I'll make to some [Indiscernible] comments and if you still have questions, you can maybe speak to IR, because I don't have everything in front of me. But I will tell you this we compete with everyone across the Board. We compete with the large money center banks, we compete with the regional banks, with local banks, and so there's plenty of competition in all markets and we monitor the market dynamics as you'd say, a pretty granular level and so we will respond accordingly. And I think we do pretty well across the Board and I wouldn't call anyone out as standing out all, anyone out as a clearly being more challenging, but that's an ongoing sort of interesting dynamic process.","So, we compete -- everywhere we compete, we compete with a lot of people who want these high quality liquidity products -- relationships and so do we.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And I apologize if you addressed this; I had to jump off the call for a minute. The deposit beta, where does it stand today for you folks? And on your Investor Day, you gave us a very good trajectory of where you think it's going to. Are you still on that trajectory of where you think you should be?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, with deposit betas, you have to sort of take the because there's a sort of full spectrum. We are, as an industry, firmly on a reprice journey. No doubt. And so the state of play and the maturity of that reprice journey depends upon the specifics of the business and the client. And so at the wholesale sort of top end reprice is really reasonably high. Not to say that there's nowhere left to go, but it's reasonably high and pretty consistent. And as you go down through into the middle market space and small business and all the way down to the retail space, it's still relatively early days given the absolute level of rates. And so we continue to see the journey.","As I said we've seen migrations in [Indiscernible] now for few quarters. As people are sort of reassessing deposits versus investments, we're retaining those investments. So, we feel good about that. But that is generally a precursor to what we will see in retail at some point in future and not yet.","So, with respect the final part of your question which was are we still feeling like the trajectory we showed you is our central case and the answer is yes at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski","Yes, good morning. You touched on this in a tangential way, but let me ask it a different way. If we look at your Card fees on a consolidated basis back in 2014, 2015 before you had the Sapphire launch, it was running around $1.5 billion a quarter, it bottomed out late 2016 and early 2017 at $900 million and now you're up to $1.275 billion. Should we expect -- as Sapphire completely mature, should we expect that to go back to the $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion a quarter or is that ancient history and not indicative of anything?","Marianne Lake","So, I can't really comment on dollars, I'll tell two things. The first is that we've given you -- so to 2018, our expectation of the revenue rate that will be now likely above the 11.25% we previously said. I will tell you we are largely we have lacked, we have lacked the Sapphire reserve quarters now, right, so the big quarter is the hundred, thousand, point premium quarters, those were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter -- the fourth quarter of 2016, the first quarter of last year. So, I would call that in the rearview mirror now and from here, we grow with the growth in the accounts and the businesses and the spend.","So, we still expect to grow. But remember also in that rebase lining and I can't remember which period you called out, but also remember we have gone through a whole renegotiation of all our Card co-brand relationships that have an impact. So, growth will be an offset. We've had some structural stepdown for the reprice of the co-brand, there's still great partnerships and we consider it very valuable. Sapphire we're lacked and from here, hopefully we just continue to grow.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Al Alevizakos of HSBC.","Al Alevizakos","Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. I was wondering equities clearly was strong in the quarter, but I was wondering if you could give us some geographical split. I'm particularly interested since I'm based in Europe to see if you witnessed any impact from the new regulation especially MiFID II in either cash or derivatives? Thank you.","Marianne Lake","Sure. So, let me just start like at the top of the house and say we've been talking about globally investing in bankers and sales people and technology and building out our platforms across cash and prime space. It is the case because we were not competitive in the international synthetic prime years ago and we now have among best-in-class sort of platform that that has been part of the growth drivers, I would say EMEA, international primers has been a bright spot, generally MiFID II.","So, I would say that there was a concern about pullback in trading. We saw a bit of hesitation, particularly as in fixed income, less so in equities, but the market was generally be quite resilient and so we're still only relatively early days. And within the result that we had articulated to you, we've seen material increases in EMEA electronic trading, which we think will be likely somewhat permanent where people are choosing to do high touch cash trading, we're seeing some concentration among players which is all to say that we are seeing the industry wallet decline and margins compressed, but for us in particular, we're also benefiting from higher volumes. We think we're gaining share and we're benefiting from some of that concentration among top players. So, net-net, yes, I think we're seeing some pressure on the in scope wallet, but less so than you would think for us and its early days, but we'll just have to keep watching it.","Al Alevizakos","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Marianne Lake","Okay thank you guys. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"12102":["JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.","Douglas L. Braunstein","Thanks, operator. I'm going to be taking you through the earnings presentation, which, as you know, is available on our website. And I'd also ask everyone to refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","And with that, if you all turn to Page 1, for the quarter we generated net income of $5.4 billion, $1.31 per share. That's on revenues, $27.4 billion, up 6% year-on-year, 24% quarter-on-quarter, return on tangible common equity of 16% for the quarter. And I'll characterize solid performance across most of our businesses, particularly strong results in the Investment Bank and a significant improvement year-over-year in Mortgage Banking. ","There are a number of significant items that we're highlighting here on this page. We do that every quarter. It includes DVA, reserve releases, litigation build and WaMu settlement.","Every quarter, we also have some modest pluses and minuses. We don't put these upfront. But if you did total these significant items, they had an aggregate negative impact of $0.09 a share on our reported numbers this quarter. I'm going to discuss them in much more detail as we go through the financials.","Strong capital generation in the quarter. We ended with Tier 1 common of $128 billion. That's up 5-plus-billion dollars, strong Basel I and Basel III ratios of 10.4% and 8.4%, respectively. ","And I wanted just to highlight a couple of trends for the quarter, and then we'll go into the businesses. First is if you look across our businesses, we have continuing signs of underlying fundamental growth. So 23% loan growth across Wholesale year-on-year. Record middle-market loans this quarter, up 19% year-on-year. $4 billion of credit provided to small businesses. That's up 35% year-on-year. Record retail channel mortgage originations, up 11% this year. Deposits and CBB, up 8% year-over-year. Sales volume in card, up 12% year-over-year, and so the underlying fundamentals year-on-year look strong. ","On the credit side, we continue to have stable and good credit results in our Wholesale business. And on the Consumer side, real continuing improvement in Consumer. And I would say in aggregate, we're putting on better quality loans today from that loan growth. Just 2 quick statistics: in mortgage, net charge-offs are down 25% year-on-year; in card, net charge-offs are down 37% year-on-year.","So with that as sort of an underlying theme, let's turn to the Investment Bank on Page 3. And for the quarter, you see circled net income of $1.7 billion. That's on revenues of $7.3 billion, reported ROE of 17%. On Page 1, we did highlight $900 million in DVA losses pretax for the IB this quarter. And as we've mentioned consistently in the past, we don't consider the DVA as a part of our core business results. And in fact, after the changes from this quarter -- if you remember the spread widening we saw in the third quarter of 2011, where we booked a $1.9-billion gain on DVA, in the last 2 quarters we've now reversed $1.5 billion of that. And obviously, if spreads returned to the level they were last summer, we would have gone round-trip. ","So I'm going to focus on the IB numbers, excluding all DVA. So in the first quarter, revenues were $8.2 billion, $2.2 billion in net income, and we had a 23% return on equity. And that -- those numbers are all very comparable to what was a very strong first quarter of 2011, but I do want to remind everyone that we tend to have a seasonally strong first quarter to start the year. IB fees in the quarter of $1.4 billion, that's down 23% year-on-year, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. And if you look on Appendix Page 9, you'll see we continue to maintain our #1 market-leading share in fees.","Markets revenues were relatively flat year-on-year. On a linked-quarter basis, revenues were up significantly. Fixed Income revenue was $5 billion, and that reflected continued solid client revenues across the products, particular strength this quarter in our global rates business. Equities revenue of $1.4 billion, really improved results across cash and derivatives and we continue to have improving performance from our prime services. We are seeing increased balances there, a little improved leverage in the markets and a modest uptick in spreads. Credit Portfolio revenue was a little over $400 million, up from the fourth quarter, and then expenses in the quarter of $4.7 billion were down 6% year-on-year. The comp-to-revenue ratio x DVA, which is the way we manage it, was 35% for the quarter. ","If you go directly to Page 5, Consumer & Business Banking, you'll see circled net income of $775 million. That's down 13% year-on-year and an ROE for this business of 35% for the quarter. Revenue of $4.3 billion, that's relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, but down 4% year-on-year. And that reduction year-over-year is generally consistent with our guidance on the impact of the Durbin Amendment, which we had this quarter and didn't come through in the first quarter of last year.","We continue to see solid year-over-year underlying performance trends in the business. So the deposits, up $29 billion, which I talked about, up 8%. We believe that's a growth rate faster than the industry growth rate. Business Banking originations, up 8% year-on-year. We had very strong investment sales this quarter as the markets improved, and we continue to build out CPC, our Chase Private Client business, up 41% quarter-on-quarter. And in fact, client investment assets of $147 billion is a record for Chase wealth management. ","On Page 6, you see Mortgage Production and Servicing, circled net income of $460 million for the quarter. That compared with a net loss of $1.1 billion in the prior year, so $1.5 billion swing year-on-year. We had very strong production-related revenues of $1.6 billion. And that's driven somewhat by higher volumes, so originations were up 6% year-on-year. Applications, as I mentioned, up 33%. A very favorable refinancing environment, including the impact of HARP 2.0, but we also had higher margins this quarter as a function of those volumes and some mix issues. And we should be cautious about that because we're likely to see those margins return to more normalized levels on a go-forward basis. Repurchase losses in the quarter were $300 million. That's lower than our expectations on a quarterly basis, which remain $350 million, plus or minus. In large part, that was a function of timing. ","And if you now move to the servicing side, in the middle of the page, you'll see expenses there of $1.2 billion. That includes approximately $200 million of cost for the foreclosure-related matters associated with the settlement. So if you exclude that $200 million, servicing cost continued to remain very elevated at $950 million for the quarter. And of that number, $700 million is related to default expense, which was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter, but very, very high. ","As we discussed at Investor Day, you should expect to see our servicing cost come down over time. Volume of delinquencies, as the units decline, cost will come down. We're also working very hard to make our processes more efficient. And over time, you would expect, consistent with what we shared over Investor Day, that our normalized expenses for servicing should be in the $300-million to $350-million range, but that will take a number of years to get to. ","On Page 7, you see our Real Estate Portfolios. Circled net income of $500 million in the quarter. That compares to a loss of $160 million in the prior year. Revenues down 7% year-on-year. It's the result of the runoff we've been talking about for a while. Loan balances are down $24 billion, 11% year-on-year, consistent with our guidance. And we've said that you can expect a reduction in NII in this portfolio of about $500 million, plus or minus, for the year, as we continue to run off the WaMu portfolio and our other noncore mortgage assets. ","Credit cost, you see the benefit of almost $200 million, and that is a function of delinquency trends improving across all the mortgage asset classes, including home equity. You see a circled number of $808 million for the quarter in net charge-offs, and as I mentioned, that's down 25% year-on-year. So based on the reduction in the delinquencies, which, by the way, is in the appendix on Page 16, the resolution of the foreclosure settlement and what we're seeing as stability in our severity numbers, we reduced our allowance this quarter by $1 billion. That's, again, part of the significant items on Page 1. But I will say even after that reduction, allowance coverage remains at 6% for the portfolio, $7.7 billion, which is a very conservative approach to our risk. And quite frankly, the $1-billion release is reflective of what we had to do as an accounting matter. ","I would note one other reporting change here, which is due to the industry-wide regulatory guidance. We moved $1.6 billion of our high-risk seconds into the nonperforming loan category, and that's despite the fact that $1.4 billion of those $1.6 billion are current today. As you know, we've identified those high-risk seconds early. We put reserves up against them early, and so our reserves remain unaffected. But if you excluded these changes, NPLs would have trended down year-on-year, down quarter-on-quarter, and the same would be true at the company-wide level as you look at the company statistics. ","On Page 8, Card Services & Auto, circled net income of $1.2 billion, that's on revenues of $4.7 billion. Revenues and outstandings are lower year-on-year, that's the impact of runoff, and modestly lower quarter-on-quarter. And that's primarily due to the seasonal growth that we saw and we tend to see in the fourth quarter around the holidays. We did see strong sales volume in card, as I mentioned, up 12%. But if you exclude the sale of Kohl's, sales were actually up 15% for the system. And the new product sales growth for our Freedom, Sapphire and Ink products were actually in excess of that growth rate. Auto originations, also up 21% year-on-year, and that quite frankly reflects higher industry sales.","Credit costs of $740 million really reflect 2 factors. Total net charge-offs are $1.5 billion. That's down a little under $900 million year-on-year. We've got lower delinquency and net charge-off rates circled for card at the bottom of the page. We do expect, by the way, the net charge-off rate to be 4.25, plus or minus in the next quarter. I'd also note loss rates in auto remained very low. We recognized 28 basis points of charge-offs this quarter. And as a result of all of that information, we released $750 million this quarter in card. And again, reserves here remain very robust even after that release. One other comment on card expenses, we're up 6% year-on-year, and that really was related to exiting a noncore product in the business.","Page 9, Commercial Banking. Circled net income of almost $600 million on revenues of $1.7 billion, a 25% return on equity, and that's based on a higher capital allocation for this business this year. 9% year-over-year revenue growth that's been driven by the themes we've been talking about, growth in loans and liability balances, and that's offset by the spread compression we've experienced year-on-year.","It is our seventh consecutive quarter of loan balance growth. You see the circled loan balances of almost $116 billion, up 16%. We had record revenue and record loan balances in our middle-market business for the quarter. That was up 19%. C&I loans, up 24% year-on-year, and I think the best of what we've got in industry data. Industry volumes are up 12% year-on-year. So if you think of all that, it really does reflect 2 underlying trends: growth, we believe, in terms of demand; as well as a combination of improvements in market share across those product sets. I will continue to note, utilization does remain relatively stable, where it's been at a low rate for the last several quarters. Credit costs were $80 million in the quarter here, but net charge-offs were exceedingly low at 4 basis points. ","Page 10, Treasury & Securities Services, solid results here. Net income of $350 million, up 11% year-on-year, 40% quarter-on-quarter. Revenues of $2 billion, up 9% year-on-year and that's, again, resulting from some underlying fundamental trends that are offsetting that spread compression that we've talked about. Liability balances are up 34%. International revenue was up 12%. Assets under custody is a record $17.9 trillion, up 8%, and trade finance loan balances are up 40% year-on-year. You will notice there, by the way, we had a modest decline in trade finance quarter-on-quarter, really a function of a little bit of seasonality and, I would say, an increased return of competition, particularly from some of our European competitors in the fourth -- in the first quarter. ","Page 11, Asset Management. We had improved quarter-on-quarter results in AM, largely driven by market conditions, but we are down from what was a strong first quarter 2011. Circled net income of $386 million, that's on revenues of $2.4 billion. The results were really driven by some underlying growth, as well as the market improvement we saw this last quarter. It's the 12th consecutive quarter of long-term flows, $17 billion, $43 billion over the latest 12 months. And we did set records for assets under supervision and records for assets under management. Expenses were up year-on-year, and that's largely been from the investment spending we've been talking about for a number of quarters. ","Page 12, Corporate and Private Equity. Private Equity net income of $130 million, that's on $250 million of revenue, predominantly mark-to-markets for public positions and some modest realizations this quarter. So Corporate, we recorded a net loss of $700 million, and the loss included 2 significant items.","The first is a $2.5-billion addition to our litigation reserves, predominantly mortgage-related, and we identified that up on Page 1. So I'm going to make a couple of comments here on the litigation reserve. As you know, including the actions this quarter, we've been building very significant reserves. We believe that currently, these reserves are both comprehensive in nature and appropriately conservative, given what we know about these exposures, including the information in the first quarter of this year. And I would say, absent a material adverse development that could certainly change our views, we don't anticipate making material addition to these reserves over the course of the year, but I do want to caution the fact that circumstances can change. Reserves can go up; they can go down. But we feel, based on what we know today, that we're unlikely to add materially to this position.","We did book, in addition, a $1.1-billion pretax gain that was also identified on Page 1. That is from the WaMu bankruptcy settlement. And if you excluded those 2 items, Corporate net income, excluding PE, we note on the right -- bottom right, was $175 million for the quarter. ","Page 13, the Fortress balance sheet. I've covered a lot of the topics already, but let me just add 2 comments to the page. First, as you know, we authorized a new $15-billion share repurchase. We've spent approximately $450 million year-to-date on that new authorization. And for those that are likely to ask, it's at a price of about $44.75.","Second, on trust preferred or TruPS, we have $20 billion outstanding, as you all know. We do expect to redeem $10 billion of that $20 billion in total this year, and that is pursuant to the capital plan that we submitted in the CCAR process. And for much of that -- those securities, we're going to wait until there is a regulatory call event to call those. We were in the market for a $400-million call on a single security that didn't require that trigger. And for the remaining $10 billion, currently, our view is that is very attractive long-term financing. ","On Page 14, we do have the outlook. I think I've covered all of that. And so before I turn it over to Jamie, I did want to talk about the topics in the news around CIO, and just sort of take a step back and remind our investors about that activity and performance. We have more liabilities, $1.1 trillion of deposits, than we have loans, approximately $720 billion. And we take that differential and we invest it, and that portfolio today is approximately $360 billion. We invest those securities in very high-grade, low-risk -- we invest those dollars in high-grade, low-risk securities. We've got about $175 billion worth of mortgage securities. We've got government agency securities, high-grade credit and covered bonds, securitized products, municipals, marketable CDs. The vast majority of those are government or government-backed and very high grade in nature. And we invest those in order to hedge the interest rate risk of the firm as a function of that liability and asset mismatch. We hedge basis risk. We hedge convexity risk. Foreign exchange risk is managed through a CIO, and MSR risk. And we also do it to generate NII, which we do with that portfolio. ","The result of all of that is we also need to manage the stress loss associated with that portfolio and -- so we have put on positions to manage for a significant stress event in credit. We've had that position on for many years, and the activities that have been reported in the paper are basically part of managing that stress loss position, which we moderate and change over time, depending upon our views as to what the risks are for our stress loss from credit.","All of those decisions are made on a very long-term basis. They're done to keep the company effectively balanced from a risk standpoint. We are very comfortable with our positions as they are held today. And I would add that all of those positions are fully transparent to the regulators. They review them, have access to them at any point in time, get the information on those positions on a regular and recurring basis as part of our normalized reporting. And all of those positions are put on pursuant to the risk management at the firm-wide level. ","The last comment that I would make is that based on, we believe, the spirit of the legislation as well as our reading of the legislation, and consistent with this long-term investment philosophy we have in CIO, we believe all of this is consistent with what we believe the ultimate outcome will be related to Volcker. So with that, maybe Jamie, I'll turn it over to you before we open it up for questions.","James Dimon","Yes. So Doug, thank you. So let me just -- I'm going to talk about one thing, and then we'll open to your questions. One is the stock buyback. Obviously, we've got permission to buy back $15 billion of the stock. We would have preferred to have been able to buy back substantial amounts below tangible book value, but we were unable to. We will always, as a disciplined buyback of the approximately $3 billion we issue every year, and that's the $3 billion we issue mostly for comp, and that's not on a GAAP basis just because we issue before vesting, et cetera. At 45, we will -- we reserve -- right now, we're buying back at that rate, but we may do more.","So we reserve the right at any point in time to do whatever we want, and it's based upon basically 4 things. What are the organic opportunities? They might be there, portfolios or more organic growth. What are the investment opportunities? There are a lot of things you can buy, both investments or acquisitions, which we don't really expect big ones now. Our own desire to get quickly -- how fast we want to get to our new capital requirements under Basel III. And the stock price. So it does not mean at 45 -- obviously, if the stock goes up, I think we'll be consistent and we'll buy less. When it goes down, we'll buy more. We're a buyer in size around tangible book value. And then, obviously, we reserve the right to change that at will. So let's open up to questions or comments about any subject at all.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Jamie, just because you brought it up, I think it's interesting. If you took the midpoint of the range that you outlined in the shareholder letter and you took the $23 billion, $24 billion of over-the-cycle earnings, that's a sub-7x multiple. It seems very attractive that the midpoint of the range is -- I'm just curious on how you think through the valuation when you're thinking about the use of proceeds on the buyback.","James Dimon","Well, I mean, like you say yourself, I mean, you can do \u2013- anyone can do the numbers. A tangible book value is extremely attractive at 40 or probably even very attractive at 45. I'm not saying it's not attractive, but our best thing is to grow our business and not to worry about buying back the stock. We're going to buy back the stock when it's a bargain, not just because we feel like it. And so you guys can all do the numbers and it's not going to tell you what we're going to do.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","All right. Fair enough. If you look on the quarter -- for year-on-year basis, expenses are up like 15%, and now there's more -- there's litigation cost in there and things like that. I think on the Investor Day, you had suggested flat expenses year-on-year. Obviously, it depends on Investment Bank revenues, but can you just talk about that revenue expense dynamic?","James Dimon","We said flat expenses. We still expect that. The first quarter was a little bit higher because of FICA and payroll, a whole bunch of things like that, and some one-off expenses that run through there, and that's flat if you back out IB comp and extraordinary stuff. That number should be about $12 billion a quarter. Obviously, it was a little bit higher this quarter to do that, but it will come down over time, we think.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, so still flat?","James Dimon","Remember, it's flat, but we're still doing a lot of investing. So we aren't getting other efficiencies to help pay for the investing.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Fair enough. And maybe last one for me. I think the fear around issues in Europe has started to subside post-LTRO, and I think we discussed that last call. We got a little bit of a scare over the last week or 2 with Spain. Just curious on your thoughts right now. Where are we in that process? And do you still feel comfortable on the counterparty exposures?","James Dimon","Yes. I constantly read about counter party. Our numbers, we disclosed around $15 billion, a little bit higher than that now. They obviously move around. I would still say exactly the same thing. The LTRO was a massive thing that took the -- a real catastrophe in the showing [ph] off the table. But obviously, the world is going to evaluate over time whether the fiscal union is tightened and given teeth and carrots and sticks and all that. And it's going to look at Spain and Italy's both austerity and growth plans, and it's going be like an accordion for the next 18 months. So I'm personally not going to react to that, but I think they have to do some things to give it the real stability. The LTRO wasn't sufficient. It was not a -- it was a short-term fix, not a permanent fix.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the CIO question, which obviously you've addressed and has gotten so much attention in the press this week, can I just ask one further question, which is, are all of the results of the CIO group reflected with -- only within Corporate and other? There's no sharing of any of those results with, say, FICC in terms of the reporting that we would see in the Investment Bank.","James Dimon","No. God no. No, no. A lot of the NII is given to the businesses that generate the deposits on a consistent fund transfer methodology, which -- but not with the Investment Bank. Remember, a lot -- and most of that portfolio is an AFS portfolio. Not all of it, but most of it.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, fair enough. It just...","James Dimon","We disclose both realized gains, unrealized gains and mark-to-market gains. You get all of that.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that's just a question that I ask in order to sort of assess the \"tempest in the teapot\" nature of the stories relative to the revenues that we see with it, because it don't seem to be that big.","James Dimon","It's a complete tempest in a teapot. Every bank has a major portfolio. In those portfolios, you make investments that you think are wise, that offset your exposures. Obviously, it's a big portfolio. We're a large company and we try to run it. It's sophisticated, well, obviously, a complex thing. But at the end of the day, that's our job, is to invest that portfolio wisely and intelligently to -- over a long period of time to earn income and to offset other exposures we have.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, then turning to the capital questions. Obviously, you've had a rapid growth towards your eventual Basel III targets, although, of course, we still don't know exactly what they are. And you've alluded to the conditions under which you would return capital through buybacks. But what about the potential for, say, special dividends along the way? If you felt that you had excess capital and the share buybacks were not that attractive, how would you think about that?","James Dimon","Guy, I think the right way to look at it is ask that question in 2 years. I mean, we're not at the Basel III targets yet. Obviously, you should expect dividends on a regular -- we may change our mind, but on a regular annual basis from us that will look at what to do. Obviously, it's a board-level decision, but there's going to be -- surely be no special dividend before we know what the real capital rules are. So take that off the table.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's completely fair. Mortgage origination, you alluded to better spreads obviously, and maybe you could just give us a little bit more color of how that came through, because it certainly does look like they improved meaningfully, given how the revenue evolved versus last quarter, versus the origination volumes.","James Dimon","There were several hundred million higher than what we would call normal, for a whole bunch of different reasons, including HARP, supply\/demand, the price at which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are buying and securitizing things, so I would expect that to normalize over time.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Then the last one for me is a related one, which is that looking at the mortgage apps that you received during the quarter, which would presumably tell us something about originations out a quarter or so, that's up very, very strongly. Factoring in the HARP and everything else, is that a pretty good indicator that we should expect origination revenues to improve at least in the quarter or so ahead? Or should we discount that in some way?","James Dimon","It's a measure of what you're going to get next quarter on revenues, but not -- on the volumes, but not necessarily on the spreads.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Questions on trading. Equity trading revenue seemed better than expected and better than the industry cash volumes. Any color on what helped you guys there? Was equity derivatives particularly strong? Or any other color?","James Dimon","They were a little bit stronger, yes.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then could you give us some sense of how trading revenues trended month-to-month during the first quarter, and maybe it's early, but how things are so far in April?","James Dimon","We're not going to go through month-by-month numbers. I would say so far, it was 10 days. There's going to be 60-plus days this quarter, and the 10 days is a little bit lower than we saw in the first quarter. That, in my opinion, does not reflect the next 50 days. So Doug mentioned there's usually been regular seasonality in the business, not just for us but for everybody, so whether that continues or not, who knows?","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Just following up on Glenn's expense question. So kind of x the IB comp and special items, you're shooting for kind of flattish this year. That's in like the $48-billion ballpark for the year.","James Dimon","Yes. A little over -- it was $49 billion...","Douglas L. Braunstein","It was $49 billion and change and -- John...","James Dimon","And we're a little over that...","Douglas L. Braunstein","And we're a little over on a run rate basis, flat actually quarter-on-quarter, but a little over on a run rate basis.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So you're shooting for $48 billion, $49 billion for the year in that ballpark, x all the other stuff.","Douglas L. Braunstein","Right. And that would include -- that includes all the investment spend, as Jamie mentioned.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And is comp to revenue of 35% this quarter, is that a decent guide to the year, do you think?","James Dimon","Yes, give or take.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And can you give us any color on the -- why the litigation reserve build was so big? Was some of that the AG foreclosure settlement that just happened this quarter? Or is that -- would that be separate?","James Dimon","No, no. It was the completion of a thorough review of all the reps and warranty, all the litigation, all the tranches, all the Bear Sterns, et cetera, et cetera. But the real view about all that, that's all.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just remind us or can you say what this WaMu bankruptcy settlement action was?","James Dimon","It's just a final settlement, some taxes and pensions and certain assets and stuff like that. It's been in the works for 3 years. It just -- we didn't account for until it was all finalized.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's not related to the FDIC suit about who's at fault [ph] for the putbacks.","James Dimon","No. No.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then, is the net interest income and margin trends from this quarter, that's consistent, Doug, with your expectations for the year?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Yes, I would say we're going to continue to see pressure. I wouldn't say, John, for the year, but certainly for the next quarter. And then, we'll see where the world goes. Part of it is, a little bit, we have the opportunity to buy back some TruPS. That may help improve some of the trends, and we're not quite sure when that's going to hit.","James Dimon","And part of it is discretionary, like how we invest our long-term funds over time, and we've been fairly conservative in that.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So you are sitting on kind of excess cash that you're kind of waiting for a better environment to invest.","Douglas L. Braunstein","And part of it -- part of the reason NIM was down quarter-on-quarter is there were -- we were a little more conservative in the opportunities with that excess cash.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And if you did the $10 billion of TruPS that you are planning, there might be some NIM, or net interest income benefits, Doug, that you've not put into your guidance.","Douglas L. Braunstein","That's right. Well, we didn't -- all I'm saying is we're going to have pressure -- the only thing I'd say is we'll see some continued pressure on NIM for the second quarter.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. You've talked about that in terms of spread compression and runoff, and you just haven't incorporated any impact from what you might do on TruPS yet.","James Dimon","No, it is incorporated in other things we talked about.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It is, okay.","James Dimon","Yes. But, look, the important thing is when we took those portfolio, one of the bigger decisions you make, if you look at our portfolio -- and we disclosed we would benefit from rising rates. A lot of that comes in the CIO, and it costs money to be there. But we think it's a conservative and proper way to run the company because we worry about the fat tails, much higher rates, not much lower rates or -- so we can change that and increase NIM tomorrow, if we wanted to.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","If we started to see the 10-year go up consistently without Fed funds moving up, would that be something you could take advantage of? Or when you see rates going up, Jamie, it's really...","James Dimon","Yes, but we would have to feel at that point in time that we want to do it. And there are other ways to do it. You can buy spread product, not just fixed-rate product.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then more fundamentally, there's a benefit from just kind of the shorter Fed funds going up eventually.","James Dimon","Yes, and we've told you all about that, that you'd see in TSS, a couple of hundred million in...","Douglas L. Braunstein","CB...","James Dimon","In CB, the same, and a little bit in Consumer banking.","Douglas L. Braunstein","I'd say, John, from a position standpoint, very consistent with where we were at Investment Day: a 100-basis-point rise in the curve, we generate a couple billion dollars of incremental NII.","James Dimon","All things being equal, which they're not.","Douglas L. Braunstein","Which they're not, right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups. One is on the special dividend question that was asked earlier. I guess, the reason why -- what I'm wondering is, if you were -- if you decided not to do your approved buyback this year based on what the stock is doing, then why wouldn't you do a special dividend this year to absorb what you were approved for in buyback?","James Dimon","I guess, Betsy, we don't know all the final capital rules. So if we were going to buy back the stock, my preference would be get to the -- whatever the rules are, sooner rather than later. That's all. It's not that you've lost the money. You've got -- you can -- I always call that kind of earnings in storage [ph]. You can redeploy your capital later. After we know all the rules and we have excess capital, and that's the best thing to do for shareholders, obviously the board will consider that. We're not going to consider before we get to whatever the known capital rules are. And we're going to know a lot more, remember, hopefully by the end of this year.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, I mean, the impairment for Basel III is supposed to be out shortly. But I guess the question then is, why are you...","James Dimon","Betsy, we're not going to do it before we get to our capital rules, and we don't know what they are.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, okay. So I guess, but the basic question I have is, you have an expectation for what your capital is going to end up being at year end.","James Dimon","We don't know. Our expectation is 9.5 Basel III. We don't know all the RWA rules, we don't know when it's going to come out, and we're not even sure about the 9.5.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So I suppose the question then is, why are you more comfortable doing buybacks than special dividends?","James Dimon","Because buybacks at the right price are enormously valuable for shareholders and just paying out extra cash is not.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on -- just a couple of questions on housing. So obviously, from your letter, housing is much better, green light flashing. I just wanted to understand how that comports with what was presented at Analyst Day -- Investor Day, when you talked about how estimated OREO and foreclosure projections were actually moving up in the near term, as you're getting to the pick through the python. But given your letter, I kind of wondered, well, is your investment...","James Dimon","No, no. We didn't say they're moving up. What we said is that they might move up temporarily as some of them get freed up. But if you look at total delinquent -- seriously delinquent loans and total foreclosures from a year ago to today, to the end of this year, they're going to come down. Obviously, they're kind of very lumpy as every bank goes around its own different thing. But homes for sales are down. Inventory is down. Delinquent loans are coming down. Charge-offs are coming down. Real money is coming in. And so we're just saying we're pretty much at the bottom, but -- I don't know the lumpiness by month or by quarter, but we're pretty much at the bottom here as long as you have a recovery. So if the United States goes back into a recession, all bets are off. But you have got 4 million new jobs. Household formation will probably go up. That's all I'm saying. It's not...","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Should the slide might be a little too conservative?","James Dimon","What slide?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just on where you showed temporary increase in trajectories for OREO and foreclosures.","James Dimon","Yes, but I think we mentioned the catch-up now that the AG foreclosure...","Douglas L. Braunstein","Betsy, I think that was all around the foreclosure settlement and just being able to work some of the delays through the system. That's it. Wasn't talking about the underlying fundamentals.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, got it. Okay. And then last is just the high-risk seconds that you outlined, the regulatory requirement to put them in as a non-performer even though 88% are current. You said you had reserves against it. Could you just help us understand how those reserves -- how you set those reserves up?","James Dimon","Right. So I think we fully disclosed this about 2 years ago, that we'd identified a long time ago that when -- we were surprised to find out, by the way, that a lot of seconds were still paying when the first no longer was. But when we analyzed, it was pretty obvious it was just a timing difference. That in almost all cases, the first went delinquent, the second eventually went delinquent. And in all cases, where the first went into foreclose, the second was a loss, basically a total loss. So we just recognized our reserving years ago. That's all. We specifically reserved for specifically that thing. So moving it from performing to nonperforming didn't affect our reserves. That's -- and it was $1.6 billion.","Douglas L. Braunstein","$1.6 billion in total.","James Dimon","We have other little pockets like that. We have 2, by the way, so...","Douglas L. Braunstein","We actually identified -- that group was a $4-billion number for us, of which the regulators asked us to move $1.6 billion. So we have reserves for a broader pool than just that moved pool.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you guys booked actually a pretty small gain in your Private Equity holdings, which seemed kind of conservative given the pretty significant rise we saw in Equity Markets. Could you comment maybe about that? And is that just a conservative market we should assume?","James Dimon","We're always conservative in that.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on refi, anecdotally, it seemed like there was a lot of expectation about HARP 2.0 moving a good deal of refi activity. But we haven't really seen that in the Fannie and Freddie MBS at this stage, and we also didn't see a big increase in JPM's volumes either. Is the expectation that, that is going to kick in, in a big way in the back end of the year? When you're taking a look at the pipeline, how many months does it take for that to move through the -- through your production?","James Dimon","I guess, let me just put it this way. It is more than we thought. It's picking up a little bit, but I don't think it's going to completely change everything. You were seeing refis anyway, and this just opens up a bigger universe to be refi-ed. Other than that, we just -- I just -- we just couldn't give you the numbers offhand. We may have to get back to you on that.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, last one on regulation. It feels as though, the environment is getting more constructive there, dialogues are improving. Could you maybe give some color around that? Is that your perspective as well? Is it making it a little easier to start to plan your business going forward?","James Dimon","Yes, look, I do think it's going to look better. And I do think that a lot of these things resolve during the course of this year. So hopefully, that will be true. It's still a complex environment. We've got a lot of things to do to meet all the regulatory requirements, but I do think it's getting a little better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","My questions really relate to the impact of lower interest rates. I guess the first would be, branches -- the number of branches are up 5% since a year ago, but revenues in RFS are down 4%. So I know we talked about this at Investor Day, but still the same plans to increase the branches. What metric should we look at from the outside to monitor that progress?","James Dimon","Well, I pointed out at Investor Day that branches make $1 million a branch, and we've just adjusted the build to make up for changes from Durbin and other things like that. But we are losing in total, and we disclosed like $500 million a year.","Douglas L. Braunstein","Yes, for the NIM.","James Dimon","We are running the company such that we expect to get that back. So we're not going to make short-term decisions about branch builds because of short-term spread compression. We think the value is there, and we're doing that. We just are adjusting the branch build. And so what you're seeing is almost exactly we told you. Durbin is $150 million a quarter, NIM is down by about...","Douglas L. Braunstein","It would be $400 million year-over-year. And you see the margins in that business decline by 20 bps as a result of that this quarter.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then, more generally, you mentioned that NII could see some additional pressure. What would be the biggest source of ongoing margin pressure as it relates to low rates?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Well, we've identified NII from the portfolio runoff, Mike, so that's another -- that's a $500-million number. And as we go through quarter-on-quarter now, you've got spread compression impact in TSS and in CB somewhat leveling off over time. But you'll continue to see a little bit of that, but it will level off as we normalize in a rate environment we've had low for long.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, why don't we have bigger loan growth? It looks like you're -- you mentioned you had record middle-market loan balances, but still, Wholesale loan growth versus the fourth quarter increased at the slowest pace since 6 quarters ago. So if we have, for good borrowers, the most benign rate environment in our lifetime, why wouldn't we see more loan growth in aggregate?","James Dimon","You got to be -- the issue with that is you got -- in our Wholesale, you got really 2 big books, okay? You have the Commercial Bank, which was up substantially. If I were you, that's what I'd look at. You have the Investment Bank, but that one moves around dramatically as big companies borrow, pay it off. You got a bridge loan that goes in and out, a conduit loan that goes in and out. So I wouldn't look at that one the same way. That just can go -- that can move dramatically quarter-by-quarter. But we saw, if you look at the Investment Bank, a lot of debt issuance. That -- usually when you have huge debt issuance, sometimes your bank loans go down.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So just one overview insight, it seems like traditional banking isn't doing so great. NII down, margin down, loans were flat for the quarter, utilization hasn't changed. On the other hand, capital markets are doing great. You have phenomenal issuance, great trading. Is there some insight you can give us into the industry? I mean, we have lower rates. It's not necessarily fueling traditional banking. On the other hand, capital markets are doing well. Is this just exaggerated disintermediation? Or how would you describe the current environment?","James Dimon","Mike, we've had 8 straight quarters of middle-market and C&I loan growth in the Commercial Bank. We've had probably 4 or 5 or 6 straight quarters of small business loans going up. So if you're looking at the commercial world, that's what I would look at. In the commercial -- in the consumer bank, we've had consistent growth in deposits and we have a NIM going down a little bit because of the interest rate environment. But the underlying deposits, clients, flows is actually pretty good. And credit card spend is good and debit card spend is good, but you have NIM compression. That's -- we can go over it a 1,000 times: we're going to have NIM compression. That's just, if you think of that as like the cost of mozzarella for pizza, when it goes up, your margins go down a little bit. It doesn't mean you're selling less pizza.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two things jumped out to me from a big picture point of view. The comp ratio of the Investment Bank was, as you mentioned, lower than a year ago, 35 versus 40. The pace of reserve release and the credit book also accelerated quite a bit. And I guess just from a high-level point of view, you tend to be very conservative when you can be, especially at the beginning of the year. So as we think about each of those 2 buckets, which I realize are completely separate, but as we think about the comp ratio of the Investment Bank, what is it within the businesses that you're trying to change or think that will be different than they've been in the past, where you've kind of erred in the side of being a little more conservative early on in the year?","James Dimon","Nothing. Remember, there's a lot of things that go into the comp ratio of the bank. But I think the best way to think about it is, 35, give or take. We've always said 35 to 40. But a lot of things affect that, and that's why we book it because nothing's changed. And the reserve takedowns were in mortgages and credit card and they're required. The accountants look at a whole bunch of numbers, they make you take it down, so we had to take it down. We don't expect -- I think it's important. We don't expect big take -- reduction in reserves in credit card anymore. Mortgage over time will have to come down as the book gets smaller and charge-offs come down.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And on the mortgage reserve release, I think this is the first quarter that you had significant reserve release in the RFS. As you think about the pace going forward, based on what you see right now, would you expect something similar?","James Dimon","Maybe. We don't really know. We've got to see what happens to charge-offs over time.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just coming back to the Investment Bank comp, I mean, as we think about the businesses there, there's been a lot of talk about trying to manage down the comp ratio within FICC. Is that something that's driving the ratio? Is it -- or is it just a different...","James Dimon","You're barking up the wrong tree. If you want to model, your model should be 37.5 and just leave it there. Every -- we have consistently, for years, charged capital of the businesses, looked at risk-adjusted returns, multiple-year returns and all the things like that. So our basic methodology is not going to change. You may see the percentage payout come down. We were already at the low end of -- relative to competition.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I was less concerned about the specific number and more just thematically. When I was in their, I guess, early February meeting with Jes [and some of the other people I've talked with, it seems like there's just a lot of effort to try and get the FICC comp ratio down. And I was just wondering if that...","James Dimon","I think there are reasons that the comp ratio is going to come down, but -- and I know Jes has spoken about it. So I do think there are pressures that will bring it down, which are more related to competitive pressures than just that number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but just one quickly on FICC trading and the strength there. You talked about the rates business. But is there any way to put color around how much of the strength in fixed income trading was sort of volume-related and how much was basically more market-oriented based on just gains -- mark-to-market gains on sale in the inventory through the quarter?","James Dimon","Yes. There is -- it is, but we had very good volumes. And you're absolutely correct. Volumes drive it, spreads drive it and kind of your positioning drives it a little bit, so -- but volumes will be probably the primary driver. Obviously, we want to do a good job positioning the inventory, too.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I mean, I think the fear is -- I mean, obviously, the first quarter is usually seasonally strong. The fear is not just that you maybe get a little bit of drop-off in volume after the first quarter, but that some of the strength came and it -- obviously, we can't measure it from the outside looking in. But some of the strength came from just the fact that debt spreads in almost every asset class were tightened so much throughout the quarter. Is there any way to think about that as we try to think about where trading could go for the next several quarters?","James Dimon","Yes, all things being equal, when that happens it will be a benefit to your trading results. And if it goes the other way, it's usually a negative. Not necessarily that way because you can position for it. So if I were you, you can look at volume, spreads, and you can make your own estimate. But every company takes different positions and tries to protect itself from that. But all things being equal, that's a back wind for trading, yes.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But no way to sort of give us any sense of how much of a back wind that was in the first quarter...","James Dimon","It was a little bit of a benefit this quarter, but it would be a mistake to start to break that out, because you don't have to be positioned that way. That's why it's a mistake to break it out that way.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, I wanted to come back for a moment to the delinquent mortgage servicing cost issue. And just looking at industry statistics, the number of homes in delinquency have almost dropped by half since early 2010, but the number of homes in foreclosure has stayed flat at like about 2 million, 2.1 million and ever since then hasn't budged. And it seems to be the number of homes in foreclosure that drives the expense levels. And I'm wondering, does the AG settlement kind of give you an ability to break the logjam a bit and to accelerate the process? And\/or when should we start seeing the decreased delinquencies translate into decreased foreclosure and foreclosure-related expense?","James Dimon","I think we've told you that you should start seeing it like every quarter for the next 8 quarters. It will be a little lumpy, but my guess is 8 quarters from now it will be a lot less than it is today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to circle back on the margin commentary in NII. I think you'd mentioned that perhaps in 2Q, there could still be some pressure, but we shouldn't really read into that in terms of pressure throughout the year. I just wanted to tie that back to kind of the full year commentary about the real estate run-off drag of, I think, $500 million year-over-year, as well as the Consumer business banking drag of, I think you still think about $400 million. How do we think about it in terms of potentially when there would be an inflection point?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Andrew, I'd say if you think about it, 5 to 10 basis points for the next quarter; it will moderate a little bit going forward; and then it's going to be a function of, as Jamie said, our positioning and a function a little bit of what the financing market looks like in general. But near term, that's a good indication and that incorporates all of the runoff, all the margin pressure and a variety of pluses and minuses.","James Dimon","It's hard to speak about this in a consolidated thing. Probably for the most part, TS will see it. If you see it in Commercial Bank, it's going to be more to pricing pressure than it is to margin pressure loans. And if you see it in -- what Doug said are probably most in the consumer bank, but each business is a little different and...","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, any sense of when the real estate drag kind of starts to slow down? When could we see an inflection in terms of C&I and Business Banking, maybe growth offsetting that drag? Is it by the end of the year? Or do we have to wait till next year?","James Dimon","I guess, the drag is going to slow down, but it's going to go on for years.","Douglas L. Braunstein","And, Andrew, remember, I put that chart up at Investor Day. We're releasing capital with that as well. So the fact of the matter is, as that slows down, it does hurt NII. It goes on -- hurts NII, but it's releasing capital along the way.","James Dimon","And it is -- I talked about [ph] this last year, but it was $600 million last year. It's going to be $500 million this year. It's going to be $350 million the year after that. It's going to be $250 million -- it's just going to come down over time as the portfolio runs off.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then just one last ticky-tack [ph] question. In IB, you talked about the DVA loss of $900-million-plus, but there was also a CVA gain this quarter. How much was that?","Douglas L. Braunstein","It was about $175 million. We manage that number, as you know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of follow-ups. One on FICC, did you see any evidence of market share gains as some of the Europeans have decided to pull back there? Or was it a more kind of a broad-based business improvement in the FICC line?","James Dimon","I don't think we saw any real material market share gains since I've been going [ph] to Europe.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, so you really haven't seen that yet. On the HELOCs, the $1.6 billion that you added to NPAs, is that representative of all of the HELOCs that are behind delinquent firsts? Is that like 100% of those? Or is it just part of the ones that might be behind delinquent firsts?","Douglas L. Braunstein","It's a part.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a part. Okay, so we don't really have the number on the big picture.","Douglas L. Braunstein","Again, no, we identified -- we have $4 billion that are part of that portfolio, of which $1.6 billion had to move. We reserved, as Jamie talked about, across the whole $4 billion of the portfolio. Each of -- there are different characteristics within that.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","But why did this $1.6 billion move and not the other $2.4 billion?","Douglas L. Braunstein","Because it fit the specific guidelines of LTV that the regulators asked for.","James Dimon","That other stuff is better -- has a better LTV makeup than that $1.6 billion.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, I got you. And one last question on the margin. The one thing that was a little strange was that the long-term debt cost jumped pretty material, about 56 basis points sequentially. Was that related to -- was there something about last quarter where you had some debt gains that kind of skewed that? Or why would the long-term debt numbers be going up so materially?","Douglas L. Braunstein","It was...","James Dimon","You got it.","Douglas L. Braunstein","You got it exactly right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Jamie, just to change the comp -- the discussion a little bit. We're hearing out there for loan growth, the people that are getting loan growth that there's a lot of price competition and underwriting competition, especially in the commercial markets. And a lot of people bring up your name is being one of the most competitive out there for pricing. I was just wondering if you could add some color to that. And are you taking outsized interest rate risk growing your portfolio?","James Dimon","Well, 2 separate things. First of all, there is competition in pricing. I'm surprised to hear it's us. And I've heard that before. We went and checked, and we see no evidence of that. Obviously, we don't want to drive the market like that. It's got nothing to do with interest rate exposure. We don't look at -- we fund -- we try to max fund loans the way we look at loans. We don't say, okay, we'll take the interest rate exposure and pass it onto the client.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So you hedged -- so you're just saying you're hedging most of those. If you're doing fixed rate at 5 or 7 years, you're hedging all that out.","James Dimon","Yes.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then you're saying you're surprised to hear that your name is mentioned a lot, but especially out West, your name comes up a lot and...","James Dimon","Well, Paul, it's because we're a new competitor out West. So obviously, we're competing out West to gain share. Everything we do out West -- remember, we didn't have a big middle-market operation out West, so everything we're doing is taking share from someone, as opposed to like going to Midwest where it's a lot more renewals than it is new business. I understand why you're hearing that out West.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And what about underwriting standards? We're hearing that, that's been -- also been cheapened.","James Dimon","Absolutely not. It may be cheapened for the industry, but it's nothing to do with us.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, one quick follow-up on the expenses related to servicing. With the servicing -- and you've taken some write-downs on servicing already related to higher costs. But is the AG settlement -- does that materially increase servicing costs? Or has that already been factored into your valuations?","James Dimon","We reserved a bunch of that stuff in prior quarters. It cost us $200 million in this quarter, and of most the rest is incorporated in loan-loss reserves, and it's already in our higher servicing costs. We've already been running to the consent orders and things like that, so it's not like -- it's not going to add additional servicing cost. We also, as you pointed out, recognize some of it in the MSR already, and we've done the value of MSR relating to some of that.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes, I know you've done that in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca Securities, Research Division","Two questions on capital, if I may. The first one really is on the Basel III RWA. I know you don't disclose them, but perhaps you could give some indication as to the extent to which you mitigated those, either passively or actively, during the first quarter. That's the second one -- or the first one rather. And the second one really id obviously your enthusiasm for getting to your Basel III ratio. I think you said getting the yolk off your shoulders, at the Investor Day, sooner than later. That's pretty well been taken up by nearly all your competitors apart from one fairly large one in Frankfurt which seems intent on moving fully to 2019 and is obviously sitting on a considerably higher leverage ratio than your good selves. I mean, do you think that you and your peers who are taking this regulatory high road are putting yourself in a competitive disadvantage to this fairly powerful player? Or do you think that the regulatory pressures will start to actually bring you together much more quickly that perhaps they might envisage?","James Dimon","Look, I don't think it does that at all. I think we all compete in the marketplace, and I don't think that your capital ratios change your competition that's in the marketplace. And we're all waiting for more guidance from the regulators. It's not like there's a total competition for capital. And then the RWA is 2 pieces, okay? It's really -- one piece is simply the runoff of stuff which is going to go away. That's happening every quarter. We've already talked about the Consumer portfolio running off. There are a couple of things in the IB running off. There are a couple of things. And the second is just the normal adoption of modeling capabilities that can be used in B III, that's all, that were not being used before because we didn't need to. And so it's those 2 things -- and they're rolling in over time.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing comments?","James Dimon","Thank you. Folks, thank you for spending some time with us, and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Welcome to JP Morgan Chase\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JP Morgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, Operator. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","The third quarter was generally constructive across businesses and asset classes. Underlying business drivers grew broadly and we maintained or gained share in a competitive environment. The U.S. and global economy continue to grow. Clients are active with demand for credit remaining solid, all in all resulting in 7% growth in net income driven by positive operating leverage as revenue rises and expense remains controlled. On an adjusted basis, this is a clear record for a third quarter.","Of course, against this financial backdrop I want to acknowledge the recent natural disasters. The impact on affected customers, communities and employees has been devastating, and supporting them is our priority as we rebuild. I will note that any financial impact is not significant to our results.","Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.76, and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $26.2 billion. Highlights for the quarter include average core loan growth of 7.5% year-on-year, and the FDIC recently released its survey showing that the firm has surpassed the competition and now ranks number 1 in total U.S. deposits and in deposit growth, driven by strong consumer deposit growth up 9%.","Client investment assets, credit card sales and merchant volumes were all up 13%, and we continue to rank number one in global IDCs. We had record revenue in the commercial bank and delivered record net income and assets under management in assets and wealth management. The credit environment continues to remain benign across products and portfolios. Card charge-offs were fully in line with our expectations and guidance, and outside of card our charge-off rates remain at historically low levels. ","Now turning to Page 2 and some more detail about the third quarter. Revenue of $26.2 billion was up approximately $700 million or 3% year-on-year driven by net interest income up $1.2 billion, reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued loan growth, partially offset by lower markets revenue. Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was flat to last quarter and to last year if you exclude $175 million of one-time items in CCB in the prior year period. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up about $200 million year-on-year driven by higher net charge-offs in card, and in the quarter we built card reserves of $300 million primarily due to seasoning of newer vintages. We saw a wholesale release of over $100 million partially driven by select names in the energy sector and reflecting improvements in portfolio quality in commercial real estate.","Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3, what is most notable on this page is that all of the numbers are basically flat quarter-on-quarter with the exception of growth in tangible book value per share, as capital generation was fully offset by distributions, reflecting a payout of above 100% for the first time in a long time, in line with our previous capital plan. From here, we expect the direction of travel for our CET 1 ratio to be lower over time.","Moving on to Page 4 and consumer and community banking, CCB generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 19%. We continue to grow core loans up 8% year-on-year driven by mortgage up 12% and business banking, card and auto loans and leases were each up 7%. Year-on-year, we saw 13% growth in each of client investment assets, card sales and merchant processing volumes. Nearly half of the growth in investment assets came from net inflows and our deposit margin continued to expand, up 6 basis points this quarter. ","Revenue of $12 billion was up 6% year-on-year. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 15% on higher NII, approximately equally due to margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was down 17% on loan spread and production margin compression as well as lower net servicing revenue driven by the MSR. Underlying that decline, the mortgage business is performing well relative to the market. Our originations are down only 1% versus the market down an estimated 15% as we gain share and purchase.","Finishing up on revenue, card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was up 7% as higher auto lease income and growth in card loan balances outpaced the continued impact of investments in new account acquisitions. Expect CCSA fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire reserve last year. ","Expense of $6.5 billion was flat year-on-year or up 3% excluding the one-time items I mentioned. Higher auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth were partially offset by lower marketing expense. The overhead ratio was 54% for the quarter as positive operating leverage despite significant investment in the business moves us closer to our medium term target.","Finally on credit performance, in terms of net charge-offs, as I said, card increased in line with expectations and guidance, and in auto charge-offs included approximately $50 million of a catch-up reflecting regulatory guidance on the treatment of customer bankruptcies. Excluding this, the loss rate in auto was only 41 basis points. In general, it feels like the auto market has plateaued at current levels with inventory, incentives, used car prices and SAW all having stabilized over the last few months. In terms of credit reserves, are previously mentioned, we built $300 million in card reserves in the quarter as we grow, and although there were no mortgage reserve actions, portfolio quality improvements allowed us to absorb the expected impact of the hurricanes into our current reserves.","Now turning to Page 5 and the corporate and investment bank, CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $8.6 billion and an ROE of 13%. The third quarter of 2016 revenue in both IBCs and markets benefited from a number of (indiscernible) events and higher levels of volatility, creating tough comparisons across the board. This quarter in banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was strong and relatively flat from last year\u2019s record levels. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve gained some share and maintained our number one ranking in global IBCs. We also rank number one in North America and EMEA. ","We printed record advisory fees for third quarter, up 14% on broad strength across sectors and deal sizes particularly in Europe, making up for a smaller wallet in North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 21%; however, we rank number one in wallet, number of deals and volumes globally for the quarter and for the year to date. The market remains active and the pipeline healthy. In debt underwriting, there was a reasonably high run rate coming into the quarter and we broadly maintained it, landing fees slightly down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter driven by strong re-pricing and refinancing activity and high yield bond issuance. We rank number one in fees year-to-date and gained share overall and across products. ","Treasury services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 15%, and while higher rates are a driver, we are also seeing positive momentum in organic growth in the business globally as our clients are responding favorably to the investments we\u2019ve made in our platform and products. ","Moving on to markets, total revenue was $4.5 billion, down 21% year-on-year against an impressive third quarter of 2017 in a quieter and very competitive environment. Fixed income revenue was down 27%, a solid performance given a backdrop of low volatility and tight spreads. At the risk of laboring the point, you may recall that we gained 240 basis points of share in FIC in the third quarter of \u201916, which will mean our year-on-year decline will look larger than most.","Equities revenue was down 4% but underneath that is a diversification story. Consistent with last quarter, lower flow and exotic derivatives activity was substantially offset by strength in cash and prime, which continues to be a bright spot throughout this year. ","Before I move on, the fourth quarter environment so far feels consistent with the second and third with no obvious catalysts on the horizon for that to change, but of course change it could, so it\u2019s worth pointing out that the fourth quarter last year was also a record for a fourth quarter since the crisis and as such, we expect next quarter\u2019s markets revenues to be lower year-on-year. ","Securities services revenue of $1 billion was up 10% driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 15% year-on-year as well as by higher asset-based fees on market levels globally. Finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 3% year-on-year driven by lower compensation expense on lower revenues, and the comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 27%. ","Moving to commercial banking on Page 6, another excellent quarter in this business with net income of $881 million with record revenue and an ROE of 17%, and although we recognize that our results are flattered by a benign credit environment, the performance is very strong and broad-based and is driven by the investments we\u2019ve been making in the business, the differentiated path on capabilities we can offer our clients, and our commitment to business discipline. ","Revenue grew 15% year-on-year driven by deposit NII and on higher loan balances with overall spreads remaining steady, and while IB revenue was down some year-on-year, we grew 9% sequentially with particular strength in middle market, which is starting to feel like a trend. Expense of $800 million was up 7% on continued investment in the business focused on technology as well as banker coverage, having added over 200 bankers since the beginning of 2016; and since our investment agenda is ongoing, expect fourth quarter expenses to remain at about this level.","Loan balances were up 10% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 8% year-on-year driven by strength in expansion markets and specialized industries, but were flat sequentially in line with the industry on flat utilization despite decent deal flow and stable pipelines. Commercial real estate saw growth of 13% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, and although growth rates are decelerating, we continued to outpace the industry; however, we remain very disciplined in client selection, products and pricing, and are sticking to what we know well.","Finally, credit costs were a benefit of $47 million, predominantly driven by commercial real estate. Credit performance remains strong with the net charge-off rate of 4 basis points. ","Leaving the commercial bank and moving onto asset and wealth management on Page 7, asset and wealth management reported record net income of $674 million with pre-tax margin of 33% and an ROE of 29%. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year driven by higher market levels and by strong banking results on higher deposit NII. Expense of $2.2 billion was up 2% year-on-year driven by a combination of higher compensation and higher external fees for which there is an offset in revenue. ","This quarter, we saw net long term inflows of $21 billion with positive flows across fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives being partially offset by outflows in equity products. We also saw net liquidity inflows of $5 billion and continued to increase our global market share. Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were up 10% and 9% respectively year-on-year on higher market levels globally, as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 6% year-on-year and 4% sequentially, reflecting continued migration from deposit accounts into investment-related assets as we are retaining the vast majority of these balances. Finally, we had record loan balances up 10% year-on-year driven by mortgage up 19%. ","Moving to Page 8 and corporate, corporate posted net income of $78 million, treasury and CIO\u2019s results improved year-on-year primarily due to the benefit of higher rates, and you\u2019ll remember that last quarter other corporate included a legal benefit which is driving the quarter-on-quarter decline you see on the page. ","Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook, all of NII, expense, charge-off and loan growth remain broadly in line with previous guidance, so to wrap up, this quarter and this year we continued to consistently deliver for our clients, our businesses are performing strongly across the board, maintaining or gaining share. Our financial performance clearly demonstrates the power of the platform, the benefits of diversification and of scale, as well as an investment strategy focused on long-term growth and profitability. We remain very well positioned to continue to benefit in a growing global economy.","Operator, we can open up the lines to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. How are you?","Marianne Lake","Very well, how are you?","Betsy Graseck","Good. Two questions, one on the revenue lift in the consumer and community bank. I know on Slide 4, you highlighted that the 6% up year-on-year is driven by the higher NII and deposit margin expansion. Could you just describe a little bit if this is just the start of an improvement in transfer pricing that the consumer banking division is benefiting from, and is there a lag that we should expect would continue to drive up this revenue lift over the next several quarters?","Marianne Lake","Betsy, there\u2019s no change in our transfer pricing methodology or even the way we compute it. It\u2019s to do, as you appreciate, with obviously higher rates and the fact that we are in a very disciplined environment at this point in deposit re-price. We would expect to continue to see the margin expand over the course of the next several quarters, but we would also expect to continue to drive higher NII as we\u2019re growing our deposits. (Indiscernible).","Betsy Graseck","Right, but that FTP methodology should continue to drive up margin, deposit margin over the next couple quarters?","Marianne Lake","Yes.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Then the second question is just how you\u2019re dealing with the Equifax fallout. The question here is does the breach that occurred drive any changes to how you are assessing credit requests that come in, how you\u2019re filtering for what you perceive as fraud risk, and how you\u2019re managing the book of outbound credit requests that you\u2019re looking for from a proactive perspective on your loan book?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I think the way to think about it, not to diminish the importance of any individual breach or situation, is that we are honestly under constant attack, both in a more general side but also from a fraud perspective, and so while we always react and learn lessons from every individual situation, this is not the first breach nor will it be the last breach, so as a result we have been constantly evolving and refining the way we think about fraud prevention, detection, underwriting, continuing to move to multi-factor protocols around customer identification, looking to leverage all of our data to better inform our underwriting decisions. So the reality is that as important as it is and as much as we--as each individual breach could impact the overall equation, we have had to evolve over an extended period to the position that we\u2019re in now, and so as a direct result of this, there won\u2019t be specific meaningful changes but a continuous evolution. So when we are looking, whether it\u2019s at sending out preapprovals or marketing offers or receiving inbound applications, we are increasingly looking at a number of different data points and facts to be able to identify the customer and understand the application.","Jamie Dimon","And just to add, as part of a breach, so if your name was taken and we know that, Social Security, a driver\u2019s license, we can put in a lot of enhanced controls if we do about your name specifically. We don\u2019t have to rely on those things. With reduced reliance, we can greatly, dramatically increase anti-fraud on your accounts, so we do that and dramatically diminish any effect on our customers. ","Marianne Lake","Yes, and the reality, Betsy, is that we\u2019ve kind of operated over an extended period now on the presumption that while we happen to know about this breach, there will be others either right now that we don\u2019t know about or over time, and so we have to be proactive, not reactive, and we\u2019ll obviously look to learn anything we can but we continue to evolve, so that we can use all of the information at our fingertips. As a practical matter, we are not seeing a specific increase in fraud.","Betsy Graseck","As a result, expense impact, loan growth impact, de minimis from your perspective?","Marianne Lake","Correct, correct. As a result, we\u2019re already spending the money that we need to spend to keep hopefully ahead of the curves on all of these things. Our operating losses are--I will say that the combination of all of the information that had been compromised over the course of the last several years has put pressure on fraud costs, but nothing incremental from this, and so no, no impact on expenses or loan growth that would be measurable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. I wanted to follow up to your responses, Marianne, on no pressure on deposit pricing. I\u2019m wondering if you could, especially in light of your deposit growth strength and especially in the consumer, give us a sense on how re-pricing trends are today in terms of the consumer, wealth management versus wholesale deposits.","Marianne Lake","Yes, so look, obviously apart from the rate hike in June, nothing has really happened much since last quarter, and so the landscape is looking pretty similar, and not because that\u2019s surprising, so I\u2019ll come back to that in a second, which is to say that there\u2019s been very little to no movement in the re-pricing of deposit accounts. There\u2019s been some incremental movement in certain savings and CDs, but nothing systematic in the consumer space, but that\u2019s pretty much as we would have expected with rates at these absolute levels. So at some point in time, and that may be a couple, three more rate hikes from now, the dynamics may start to change, and so we haven\u2019t changed our perspective about what we think the ultimate re-price will look like.","In asset wealth management, the story on deposit pricing is somewhat similar - a little bit more movement, but nothing particularly meaningful or dramatic. The story there is very much again as expected. At these levels of rates, you are seeing customers start to make choices to move certain of their deposit balances into investment assets. That\u2019s normal migration that we expected and that we\u2019ve modeled, and we are retaining those balances, so we are starting to see some of the dynamics we expected play out. That started happening at the beginning of the year and has continued to progress.","Then in the wholesale space, there is a spectrum as well, so I would start with we\u2019re firmly on a re-price journey in wholesale, no doubt, and depending on where you are in the spectrum it ranges from the smaller and lower middle market companies, where the re-price is modest but present, to the higher end where it\u2019s reasonably high. ","So overall, if I step back--so that\u2019s where are. If I step back and say have we learned something new in this cycle that we didn\u2019t know, the answer is no, not really. If you look at the first four rate hikes of the previous normalization cycle, the overall cumulative deposit re-price was pretty much the same as it is now, so we continue to believe that the dynamics that we\u2019ve been talking about over the last several years and that we\u2019ve expected will play out. They may not play exactly as we have them modeled, but they will ultimately play out that way and we have appropriately conservative re-price assumptions.","Erika Najarian","Got it. My follow-up question on that is you\u2019re one of the few firms that have been really talking about anticipating the impact from a Fed balance sheet reduction over the next several years. The question I often get from investors is obviously in particular, retail is valuable not just for the price of it today but on an LCR basis, and how would you respond to the question, you know, given the 6% growth in digital in the consumer bank and 12% growth in mobile, does technology help with the stickiness of the consumer deposits, or does it potentially aid in the velocity of switching?","Marianne Lake","So at the risk of hedging, it\u2019s actually a bit of both. The reality is there\u2019s always been two different camps on the re-price area for consumer. There\u2019s been the camp of acute market awareness, low for long, technology advancements allow movement of money to be easier, competition for retail deposits and good liquidity deposits is high, therefore re-price higher. The counter to that, which has merit and which we are seeing to a degree, is customers feel that they\u2019re weighing a more balanced scorecard of things when they chose where to keep their deposits, and customer satisfaction, the suite of products and simplicity, the digital and online offerings as well as the safety, security and brand all matter, and price is a factor but not the only one.","So I would say we certainly feel that having a leading digital capability is critical to our overall customer franchise, and it will in all likelihood have an impact on stickiness of deposits because customers value that kind of convenience very highly.","I would also say one other thing about where we are right now, is that as you know, as much as you\u2019re right about the potential demand for the sort of high liquidity value deposits, there\u2019s a lot of excess liquidity in the banking system and although loan growth is solid, it\u2019s solid, so we aren\u2019t seeing a frenzy, albeit that we\u2019re very proud of our deposit growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you hear me?","Marianne Lake","Yes, welcome back.","Mike Mayo","Thank you. My question is on the consumer and community bank, a three-part question. First, what percent of your customers have online bill pay? I\u2019m trying to get back to that stickiness of the deposits.","Marianne Lake","I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, but we can get back to you.","Mike Mayo","Okay, can you give a ballpark? I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve disclosed that before. Like, to the nearest quarter, or--?","Marianne Lake","Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. I fear if I give you a ballpark, I\u2019ll get it wrong. While we\u2019re on the call, we\u2019ll get someone to send the details and let you know.","Mike Mayo","Okay, and then the second part is you\u2019re talking--the deposit beta has been lower. You gave your caveat, but mobile bank customers are up 12% year over year. Why do you still need 5,200 branches? Isn\u2019t this a good time to close branches when deposit competition isn\u2019t as tough as it might be in the future?","Marianne Lake","We\u2019re doing a bit of all of the above, so I\u2019ll start with the comment which you (indiscernible) before but which we still strongly defend, which is that branches still matter, that 75% of our growth in deposits came from customers who have been using our branches, that on average a customer comes into our branches multiple times in the quarter. I know that all sounds like old news, but it\u2019s still new news or current news, so the branch distribution network matters. ","Customer preferences are changing and we are not being complacent to that, so we are underneath the overall 5,000-plus branches continuing to consolidate, close, move, grow, change all of our branches in line with the opportunity in the markets that we\u2019re in. So net for the year, we\u2019ll be down about 125 branches. We\u2019ve closed more than that, consolidated some and added some, so we\u2019re not being complacent to the consumer preference story, but branches still matter a lot and we\u2019re building out all of the other sort of omni-channel pieces, as you know, so that we have the complete offering. If the customer behaviors start changing in a more accelerated fashion, we will respond accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning Marianne and Jamie. A question first on the loan side on the yields. Last quarter they held flat, and this quarter they\u2019re up 16 basis points. I just wonder if you could help us understand, was that more just the mechanics of timing of hikes moving through your variable rates? Is it any element of pricing or any other things you could just help us understand why we saw that great nice improvement there?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I would characterize this as over the two quarters of normal, so you may recall last quarter there were a couple of things that we talked about. First was that there was a $75 million one-time interest adjustment in mortgage which artificially reduced loan yields for the quarter, and secondly that seasonality and mix in card similarly. So we would normally in the law of extraordinarily big numbers expect for a 25 basis point rate hike that we\u2019d see about 10-ish basis points of improvement in loan yields across the whole portfolio - we didn\u2019t see that last quarter. What you\u2019re seeing this quarter is the reversal of those factors and the normal benefit of the June rate hike.","Ken Usdin","Got it, okay. My second question, with the card build, you took the reserve for card to around 3.3%. I know you had talked about staying below a 3% card loss rate for this year, but I\u2019m just wondering as we get into next year, you kind of had a medium term idea of 3 to 3.25, how are you feeling about that in terms of the seasoning of the card book and loss rates?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so as we look at the loss rates for this year, they\u2019re coming in as we expected at less than 3%, and as we look out to next year, based on what we know today, it\u2019s still in that 3 to 3.25% range, albeit maybe at the higher end of that range, so it\u2019s broadly in line with our expectations. So the reserve build--and you know, in the consumer space, we move our reserves not in dollar increments, but the reserve build is about a little less than one-third on the growth and a little more than two-thirds on normalization of rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hello. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s a little nitty gritty, but you\u2019re definitely the person for this. Point to point, the yield curve was about the same--10-year was about the same to point; however, throughout the quarter, the curve was much flatter. I\u2019m just curious if that has any dampening effect in any given quarter, and maybe the better way to ask it is could it have a little bit more of a positive run rate as we go forward? ","Marianne Lake","Yes, so a couple of things. The first is just to repeat the standard, just as a sort of macro matter, we\u2019re more sensitive to the short end of rates than to the long end of rates, particularly over any short period of time, so intra-quarter volatility in the 10-year, while it\u2019s not nothing, is unlikely to have a material impact on our run rate. Clearly an overall generally flatter long end of the curve in general on average through the year, all other things being equal, it will have had a dampening pressure on our expectations, and it\u2019s part of the reason why they went from 4.5 to 4, not the only ones, as we progressed through the year. But generally speaking, intra-quarter volatility is not something that would have a meaningful impact on our run rate. ","Glenn Schorr","Okay, cool. In terms of the loan growth, I think it\u2019s completely normal to see some moderation, and you\u2019re still doing reasonably better than the industry. I\u2019m curious on the main source of the moderation ticking down a little bit, and then more importantly, is it too soon to ask if any of this talk on tax reform and decent economic data is having a pick-up in the conversations on the loan growth side?","Marianne Lake","Okay, so on the first, I think it is quite important to not look at the average and to kind of decompose it into constituent parts, because we\u2019ve talked before about the fact that we use our balance sheet strategically in the CIB, but loan growth is not really a thing there, and so this quarter we saw no loan growth in CIB, so no big deal, but it means that that 7.5% core growth for the whole portfolio would have been outside of CIB, closer to 9, so start with that.","Consumer has been pretty consistent, so across the consumer space, whether it\u2019s our jumbo mortgages, whether it\u2019s the business banking, card, auto loans and leases, they\u2019ve been growing at reasonably solid and consistent high single digit territory, or even low double digit for mortgage over the last several quarters. At this point, we don\u2019t really see anything that is suggesting that that will moderate meaningfully. So where you\u2019re seeing--and similarly in asset wealth management on the banking side. ","So really, where you\u2019re seeing the growth moderate is in commercial, and it\u2019s in both the C&I loans and the commercial real estate loans, and they each have a story. With the C&I loans for us, the story is about moving from meaningfully outperforming the industry to being more in line with the industry, so over the course of the last couple of years as we\u2019ve added expansion markets, opened new offices, added a couple hundred bankers, developed our specialized industry coverage models, we\u2019ve been growing meaningfully better than the industry, and so you see that even in this quarter in our year-on-year growth of 8% as compared to the quarter-on-quarter growth, where it\u2019s flatter. That, to me, is really a factor of the fact that in this space in the cycle, our clients have strong balance sheets, they have a lot of liquidity, they have had access to the capital markets, and so GDP plus growth is not unlikely to be a level for the foreseeable future.","With commercial real estate, it\u2019s slightly different. We\u2019re still outpacing the industry, but we\u2019ve kind of gone from very strong to strong, and we would continue to expect that to slowly moderate. That\u2019s a number of things - it\u2019s from higher rates, it\u2019s actually a lot of competition, and then it\u2019s also about clients and activity given where we are in the cycle, so we are being very cautious about new deals that we add to the pipeline and the client selection that we have. So all of those factors, I think, weigh into the commercial real estate space.","Tax reform, so fiscal stimulus, the reality right now is although I think everyone, and ourselves included, are hopeful, obviously that tax reform is done for the right reasons and that the economy responds accordingly, at this point it\u2019s not front and center in the dialog we\u2019re having with our clients about whether they should or shouldn\u2019t do a strategic deal or take an action, so I would say it is neither holding up business nor spurring business, but that could change. So at this point, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a factor but not a driving factor, and that could change. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Yes, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the outlook on the net interest margin. Should we still expect some grinding higher of asset yields, even without rate hikes? How do we think about that trajectory, assuming we don\u2019t get any more rate hikes from here?","Marianne Lake","Well, we\u2019ll just deal with the fourth quarter because I think the landscape of rate hikes for 2018 is an open question. We would expect loan yields to hold relatively flat, all other things being equal. It\u2019s a very competitive environment. We aren\u2019t seeing--you know, we\u2019re seeing some pressure in commercial real estate spreads, we\u2019re seeing generally spreads holding up, but I would expect competitive pressures to keep loan yields relatively flat.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, and on the reserve build outlook, should we still expect it to kind of track with growth and keep the reserve ratio similar in cards to where we are now, or do you still anticipate some additional building? How do we think about? And if you could size the hurricane impact, that would be great, this quarter.","Marianne Lake","Yes, so we are--at this point, we are at that 3% charge-off rate, rising to 3 to 3.25 next year and growing, so you should continue to expect that we\u2019ll be adding to reserves. Our outlook for reserve add next quarter is below this quarter, but obviously we\u2019ll continue to observe that. ","With respect to the hurricanes, right now in this quarter\u2019s results in the credit lines in mortgage particularly and to a much lesser degree in wholesale, we\u2019ve effectively built $55 million of reserves. To sort of contextualize that, we have used our unfortunate experiences of Sandy and Andrew and other natural disasters to calibrate the assumptions we\u2019re using. At this point, it\u2019s early to be able to say how the losses will actually manifest themselves. It could be that it\u2019s lower than that, but that\u2019s our sort of central case right now, $50 million in mortgage and just a handful of million in the wholesale space.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. ","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could discuss how you\u2019re balancing all the investments you\u2019re doing in IT and business growth with the efficiency mindset that you guys always have. I guess one of the frameworks is if I look at the three-year simulation you provided in February, a lot of the expense growth seems to happen this year - we have kind of a $2 billion increase in adjusted expense in post-2017. The expense growth looks very modest, so maybe you could just talk a little bit about the leverage you\u2019re using to keep expenses in check as you\u2019re doing all the investments. ","Marianne Lake","I\u2019d just start with a bit of a philosophical discussion, which is it is our opinion that now, as much if not more so than ever, the investments we\u2019re making in technology will effectively breed and deliver the efficiency, so to the degree that we are able to find incremental investments or accelerate them, we\u2019ll be willing to do that. Our expense numbers in our outlook have never been targets, so that\u2019s the sort of mental, philosophical point of view, that we would deliver any technology innovation and investments that we could execute well that we think would be either accretive to our returns through revenues or efficiency.","Specifically when you look at the simulation, just as a point of technicality, in 2018, probably middle to third quarter of 2018, we are expecting that the FDIC (indiscernible) will reach its level at which the surcharge will be able to be reduced. That\u2019s a meaningful positive for us, and so if you look at the implied growth and expenses from \u201917 through the medium term, they are larger than it implies, but if we found the opportunity to do more or to accelerate more, we would do it and explain it to you, so we\u2019ll come back to that at investor day.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks. Then just a follow-up, you mentioned the card revenue run rate has moved up again nicely this quarter. It seems like you might be able to get your target by the early half of next year. Is there upside to that revenue run rate target? Are things coming in better than expected in terms of the moderation of promo rates and things like that, or maybe you could just give a little color there?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I think--so when we did some (indiscernible) at the end of last year, I think that we said that we\u2019d expect the revenue rate for the full year this year to be 10.5%, and it would be a little better than that. The revenue rate increase in the quarter speaks to a little bit of spread and a little bit of lower (indiscernible). It will go down next quarter because of the fourth quarter effect of the Sapphire reserve travel credit for an overall, call it 10.6 for the year. But yes, we do expect to hit the 11.25% in the first half of next year, and we\u2019ve reached the inflection point end of the second quarter and into the third quarter where growth is offsetting the impact of the significant upfront investments in Sapphire reserve, so we\u2019ll see revenues grow from here.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. ","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning. Following up, Marianne, on the commercial banking business, you\u2019ve had--you\u2019ve obviously had very good momentum there over the last couple years, and you did talk about credit dynamics and moderation in credit growth, and sort of a normalization back towards industry trends. Can you just comment a little bit more broadly about some of the initiatives you\u2019ve had there from a revenue standpoint, whether it be the middle markets initiative, growth in IB, international and whatnot? Your earnings growth has obviously been very, very strong in this business and it\u2019s starting to move the needle a little bit, but if you can just give us a little bit of color on the opportunity set you see there.","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I\u2019ll just start with credit for a second, because although we absolutely expect at some point that we\u2019re going to see normalization of credit, we haven\u2019t seen that yet - I just want to make that clear. We are appropriately cautious and staring at everything, but we\u2019re not seeing any deterioration or any thematic fragility in our portfolio that we\u2019re concerned about at this point.","With respect to the revenue side of the story and the efficiency side, it really is a story of all of the things you mentioned sort of all coming together at the same time, so we have been adding to--we have our expansion markets from the WaMu acquisition, we\u2019ve been adding new markets and opening offices, we\u2019ve been adding bankers, and as you know--","Jamie Dimon","We\u2019re in all 50 of the top MSAs now.","Marianne Lake","Yes, we are in all 50 of our top MSAs now, and we\u2019ve been adding bankers. As you know, when you add all of these investments, for a period of time when they are still in the build-up mode, you don\u2019t see that drop to the bottom line or to the top line, and now we\u2019re starting to see our bankers hit their stride, become very productive, balances are building.","Then, I would also say that this is at the epicenter of delivering the whole platform to our clients, so if you think about what we\u2019re able to offer our clients in terms of international capabilities, banking coverage across industries, core cash, global payments, we have a platform offering I think that is--well, it\u2019s certainly complete and it\u2019s somewhat differentiated. ","Then a third thing I would say is that it\u2019s a buttoned up business. We have been looking at efficiency and expenses and really working on making sure that through the simplification processes that we went through in 2013, \u201914 and \u201915, that we are focusing all of our efforts on our core strategic clients, and it\u2019s paying off.","Saul Martinez","That\u2019s great. I guess sort of a related question on the commercial banking business that\u2019s a little bit of a follow-up as well on tax reform, obviously Congress--or the administration, House Ways and Congress released a blueprint so Congress can now start to flesh out a tax plan, and obviously there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to the content, the timing - heck, whether it even happens or not. But if we do see something that is sensible, however you want to define it, how quickly do you think that we could start to see that beating through into better sentiment and ultimately into better demand, or increased demand for credit?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I would say--and like you said, there\u2019s so many uncertainties that it\u2019s almost talking about hypotheticals at this point, as encouraged as we are with the ongoing dialog. My view is sentiment is relatively high, in fact it\u2019s picked up slightly over the course of the last short while, so from that vantage point we\u2019re in a position of strength. There would necessarily be some lag, so whether that is a couple of quarters or longer, but certainly in the foreseeable future you would hope to be able to see increased demand and confidence leading to action.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. Could you just talk a bit about how you\u2019re managing the excess liquidity? You\u2019ve obviously continued to build cash, the securities book has shrunk - it makes sense give the flatter yield curve, but you\u2019ve combined that with the still good deposit trends and the slowing loan growth, and obviously a challenge as you think about protecting them going forward. So maybe just talk about the dynamics there and how you\u2019re thinking about the yield curve, how to manage that.","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I\u2019ll start with the excess liquidity question, because while we feel very, very good about our liquidity position, and you will have seen in the recent disclosures where everyone is positioned, and necessarily even if LCR was the only consideration people would want to be running a buffer to LCR, so--but LCR is not the only consideration, and the other most notable one I would point out to you would be resolution planning. So know that when we have our overall liquidity position, we\u2019ve taken into consideration a combination of constraints, and so what may look excess on one lever may not be as excess on another.","The second I would say is that when we look at the deployment of (indiscernible), we look at it in the context of our target for what we want the duration of equity for the company to be over the course of normalization in rates, and obviously it\u2019s not just about liquidity, it\u2019s also about duration. So we\u2019re comfortable with our liquidity position, we have a framework for deploying it and for thinking about the spot and forward-looking duration of the company. That\u2019s not to say that we are not opportunistic in taking advantage of moves that are technical in the long end of rates to either deploy or to un-deploy, dry powder, and we still have some. So it\u2019s more than just liquidity, it\u2019s also duration, and we\u2019ve taken the overall (indiscernible) in our expectations and our targets into consideration, albeit that we still have some dry powder.","Jamie Dimon","And we\u2019ve maximized between loans, securities.","Marianne Lake","Yes.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Then just to follow up on that rate sensitivity, you mentioned before or you reiterated before you\u2019re more levered to the short end of the curve. If we get continued increases on the short end of the curve but the 10-year doesn\u2019t go anywhere, is that still NIM accretive as it\u2019s been thus far?","Marianne Lake","So it will be over the short while, and our full expectation outside of any other like stimulation is that as the front end of rates goes up and as gradual QE unwind happens, that you\u2019re going to see the long end of rates go up, albeit more slowly. So it\u2019s pretty typical at this point in the normalization cycle to have a curve flatten - that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s what we would expect. I would expect to continue to see the long end rise, and yes, it should be NIM accretive.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Marianne. You touched on this a little bit, but maybe you can give us a little more color. You mentioned in your opening remarks you increased your market share in investment banking. Can you share with us, are you getting a bigger wallet share or are you winning more customers, and also some of your competitors are still struggling, is that also a factor?","Marianne Lake","I would say it\u2019s wallet share, it\u2019s blocking and tackling. We did pretty well in Europe but there is still a lot of competition, so I would say it\u2019s less about the specifics of any one competitor because the environment is pretty competitive, and just about sort of reasonably broad strength.","Two things that I would also point out is, first, in equity underwriting, similar to in FIC, we gained a couple hundred basis points of share in the third quarter of last year, so on an apples to apples basis to where we would normally expect our share to be, we\u2019re still doing very well.","Jamie Dimon","I would just say I think competition is fundamentally fully back. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re--or most of these players are all out there, some specialized in certain areas, but it\u2019s fully competitive, and you have new entrants soon like the Chinese banks, etc.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Possibly Jamie, if you want to weigh in on this, what\u2019s your read of the new treasury report on changes coming in the capital markets that was released in early October? Any specific items in there that you guys looked at that, that would be specifically beneficial that you\u2019d like to see changed, and what\u2019s the probability of it happening and could it happen sometime next year?","Marianne Lake","Okay, that was a lot. So look, first of all, we welcomed the report and it\u2019s a long report, a couple hundred pages. There\u2019s a lot of recommendations, very comprehensive, so kudos to the treasury for delivering it. We are supportive of those recommendations kind of writ large, and I think the most important thing to remind you is that this is not about materially changing the legislative landscape. It\u2019s about recalibrating, sensibly recalibrating the specifics of individual rules over time. So we\u2019re still digesting the report, but we are supportive. It is very comprehensive and it could be very beneficial to the liquidity and depth of the capital markets, which is what we should all hope for, and not contrary to safety and soundness. So in that sense, very supportive, all good.","It\u2019s going to be complicated and it will take time, but the will is there, and so whether it\u2019s the administration or the regulators, there\u2019s a general recognition that there\u2019s the ability and the appetite to want to make rational change, and so if that helps to grow the economy and all the things that come with that, we\u2019re working as constructively as we can on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet. ","Steven Chubak","Hi. Jamie, I was actually hoping that you could update us on your efforts to launch your online brokerage offering. It\u2019s something you had mentioned in your last letter. I was curious, since it comes up with investors quite often, how you view the opportunity set in that business for JP, whether it\u2019s an effort to just build a moat around your current client cash balances and maybe fill a void, or is your intention to become a bit more disruptive in the space and actually attract many more customers and potentially even offer more aggressive pricing and terms?","Jamie Dimon","Yes, so we\u2019re building obviously--we\u2019re kind in beta platforms, we\u2019re trading and investing in things like that, and also the P2P (indiscernible) is doing quite well. We look at all those things as things you want to--from the client standpoint, you want to offer the client. At one point, we\u2019ll be talking about more testing what we think might or might not work, and then we\u2019ll give you more of a strategic view of that, probably around investor day.","Steven Chubak","Got it, okay. Marianne, just wanted to follow up on some of the discussion around excess liquidity management. I appreciate the fact that you guys certainly want to be conservative in thinking about duration and maybe taking a more holistic view of the asset side of the balance sheet, but looking at the LCR disclosures and just given the stark contrast in terms of how much you have parked in the way of excess reserves and relatively low levels of NBS compared with your peers, how you\u2019re thinking about duration management and whether you do have additional capacity to actually remix some of that cash of the Fed into higher yielding NBS, especially as we think about the Fed balance sheet unwind dynamics.","Marianne Lake","We have a fairly large mortgage loan portfolio in addition to having a large portfolio in our investment securities in NBS, so we are already reasonably equivalently mixed in terms of our percentage of mortgage exposure to our total assets or loans to the competitive landscape. Trust me when I tell you that you talk about excess liquidity because of LCR, and we are thinking about more than just LCR, and we do--as I said, while we do maintain a short position and the cost of being short is relatively cheap, we don\u2019t have the kind of capacity to invest $100 billion-plus in NBS right now, or anything that\u2019s meaningful like that to generate higher returns without blowing through our duration targets.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi, good morning Marianne. Just a quick question on loan growth. You had another decent quarter of good growth in residential mortgage. Maybe looking across consumer, is there anywhere where you\u2019ve had to kind of open up the credit box in order to get growth there? I know you mentioned that loan yields are expected to be tight on competition, and I think (indiscernible), but have you had to go down market at all for loan growth?","Marianne Lake","No, we haven\u2019t. As we talked about before, a while ago we made some surgical changes to our credit box in the card space, but that\u2019s, if anything, I would say incredibly granular, incredibly surgically tightening, not the reverse. Whether that\u2019s in card, in certain micro cells, or whether that\u2019s in auto, I would say we\u2019ve been pretty conservative and we\u2019re probably doing at the very margins a little bit of tightening. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. ","Andrew Lim","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the quantum and timing of return of excess capital. Of course, one of your notable competitors has given a very detailed strategy of how to do this by the end of 2019. Are you in a situation to adopt a similar strategy\/","Marianne Lake","Well I mean, congratulations to them if they have a high degree on what 2018 CCARs will look like. I will tell you this - we said very clearly that we feel that the company should operate within the range of 11 to 12.5%. We feel like it should be lower in that range, and having a capital plan approved as $19.4 billion of share buybacks over the next four quarters and over 100% payout based on analyst estimates is a start. So nothing has changed about that objective, but we would want to be measured about the pace at which we do it until we have a bit more final clarity on what the new generation of capital rules will look like, so we hopefully will know more as we go into the next cycle of capital planning. We haven\u2019t changed our point of view that we should be able to continue that journey down into the range, and that would be our objective.","To tell you that we can give you the road map for that today, I think is not accurate. But you can do--you can and you have done your own math. Look at our earnings outlook in your models and payouts of over 100%, and you can see that we can move down in that same time frame to something much lower than we are now, if not towards the bottom. But that\u2019s not to say that we will be able to do that - we need to go through tests.","Andrew Lim","Okay, fair enough. Thanks. A different question - (indiscernible) is high on everybody\u2019s minds. I think everyone is focused on the impact on equity research and FIC research, but there\u2019s broader implications possibly for how that might impact FIC trading, and not just from your own point of view but also from the point of view of clients who might not be compliant by the end of the year. How does that weigh on your mind, and what impacts could we expect there?","Marianne Lake","I think I got that. So the compliance burden and the readiness and work to be ready is a significant heavy (indiscernible), as you say, for all market participants, so there is the possibility that effective at the beginning of the year, there will be ongoing work that needs to get done. We feel like we\u2019re reasonably well positioned to defend our position, but there\u2019s no doubt that over the course of the year and beyond that people get clearer and clearer on transparency and cost to execute versus advice, versus content, that there may be competitive dynamics that change, and we feel like we\u2019ve been building for the last several years to be ready for those dynamics. So there could be some bumps, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that we\u2019re concerned about at this point, and we will all learn a little more as we go through 2018.","Operator","Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Good morning, Marianne. I was going to ask you about the credit. You pulled out and highlighted auto after we went through kind of an episode of possible deterioration. You put that together with energy and what we experienced last year, those are our first two pressure points on the credit cycle, and really we\u2019ve come through without any real heartburn from either. Does that tell us something about the de-risking and underwriting discipline that the banks in particular have adopted since the financial crisis?","Marianne Lake","You know, I would say that for sure has to be part of it, and even with the auto situation, what you\u2019re seeing is, I think, a marketplace that is much more responsive . So while we felt like we got ahead of the issues and tightened early, you\u2019ve seen the sort of industry generally move in that direction. I think there\u2019s no doubt that the environment in totality with capital liquidity controls regulation has led to higher quality loan books, so yes, we have been pressure tested. Energy was a one in a 100 year flood, and I think the industry and specifically our portfolio performed really quite well.","Now that\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t a point of pain out there somewhere that we won\u2019t see; we just feel like we\u2019ll be in a position to get through that.","Marty Mosby","Then (indiscernible) deposit growth, what we saw is you kind of layer deposits in institutional deposits, corporate deposits, retail deposits. We\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a pressure and a sense of institutional deposits in wealth management began to decline. Corporate and retail still show a lot of strength. Just kind of think about that dynamic, because that\u2019s really where you begin to see pressure on betas, is typically when you see pressure on volumes, and we just haven\u2019t seen it in the core deposit base yet. So a premium for liquidity that\u2019s been kind of pushed into those core customers from corporate and retail, things should be pretty persistent, which would mean the duration and the length and the growth of deposits will be much longer than what we probably anticipated before?","Marianne Lake","Yes. Yes, all of the above. I would tell you that we are seeing that rotation start. If you go back even three years ago, we kind of gave you an outline of what would happen. We said we were going to see rotation from the high wealth segment into investment assets, followed ultimately by the consumer space. We\u2019ll see retail deposits move into money funds, we\u2019ll see outflows of wholesale (indiscernible) deposits as the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, but those things are going to play out over the course of the next--you know, depending on the rate curve, over the course of the next two to four years, so we\u2019ve begun to see it. It should be expected. I don\u2019t think it tells us anything new or different necessarily at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi, a follow-up question. So card revenues are tracking well, per your other comments, but year-over-year card spend growth has moderated some. Can you talk about the trends with the Sapphire reserve card?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so look, our card spend growth at 13% up year-on-year is still very strong, so when we say moderated, it\u2019s from very strong to very strong, and it is in part due to the number of new products we\u2019ve had. So we would continue--the Sapphire reserve card spending engagement is very strong, and we\u2019re very pleased with it, so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a moderation necessarily. It\u2019s just at these very high levels, slightly higher to very strong is still a great story.","Marty Mosby","It was such a great deal a year ago. What\u2019s the attrition like with the customers?","Marianne Lake","If you think about our first acquisitions were in August and September, so we\u2019re kind of at the early stages. So far very encouraging, so far better than our expectations, but a little early to sort of draw some conclusions on it, but very encouraging.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Marianne Lake","Okay, thank you everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Piepszak, please go ahead.","Jennifer Piepszak","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.","Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.5 billion; EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $29.2 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Underlying performance continues to be strong. Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across consumer and wholesale with average balance up 7% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots as average loans across the company were at 3% year-on-year excluding the impact of home lending loan sales in prior quarters.","Client investment assets and consumer business banking were up 27% and asset and wealth management AUM was up 19% reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year, as well as organic growth. We've ranked number one for the full year in Global IB fees with 9% wallet share. And growth IB revenue in the commercial bank was a record $2.7 billion.","In CIB Market, we were up 56% year-on-year compared to a weak fourth quarter last year, however, it's important to note the quarter was very strong in absolute terms. In fact, a record fourth quarter. And credit performance continues to be strong across the company.","On to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII. Noninterest revenue was up $2.6 billion or 21% on higher revenue in CIB markets and AWM and continued strong performance in home lending and auto. Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 4% on volume and revenue related costs. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.4 billion, down $121 million, or 8% year-on-year, reflecting modest net reserve releases and net charge-offs in line with expectations.","Turning to the full year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $36.4 billion; EPS of $2.72 and revenue of $118.7 billion all records. And delivered a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Revenue was up $7.2 billion, or 6% year-on-year with net interest income up $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. ","Noninterest revenue was at $5.1 billion, or 9% driven by growth across consumer and higher CIB markets revenues. And expenses of $55.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenue related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. Revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year. And on credit, performance remains strong throughout 2019. Credit costs were $5.6 billion.","In consumer, credit costs were up $210 million reflecting an increasing card due to balance growth, largely offset by lower credit cost and home lending. And in wholesale, we were at $504 million largely due to reserve releases and higher recoveries both in 2018. ","Moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%, up slightly versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. And while on the topic of capital, it's worth noting given the actions we have taken; we fully expect it will remain in a 3.5% G-SIB buckets.","Before we move into the business results, I'll spend a moment talking about CECL on Page 5. As you know, the transition to CECL was effective on January 1st and therefore there's no impact to our 2019 financials. On the page is the CECL adoption impact, an overall net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion which is at the lower end of the range we've provided. This was driven by an increase in consumer of $5.7 billion mostly coming from card, partially offset by a decrease in wholesale of $1.4 billion.","In Card, the increase is a result of moving to less time lost coverage versus a shorter lost emergence period under the incurred model whereas in wholesale modeling changes like using specific macroeconomic forecast versus through the cycle loss rates under incurred result in a decrease especially given the forecast to credit environments. Recognition of the allowance increase has resulted in a $2.7 billion after-tax decrease retained earnings as you can see on the page. Also important to note, we have elected to use the transition approach to recognize the impact on capital.","And now turning to businesses, we'll start with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6.","In the fourth quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31% with accelerating deposit growth of 5%. Client investment assets at 27% and total loans down 6%. For the full year, results in CCB were strong was $16.6 billion of net income, up 12% and an ROE of 31% on revenue of $65.9 billion, up 7%.","Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, up 3% year-on-year. In Consumer and Business Banking, revenue was down 2% driven by deposit margin compression largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher noninterest revenue on the increasing client investment assets as well as accountant and transaction growth.","Home Lending revenue was down 5% driven by lower NII on lower balances which were down 17% reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue predominantly offset by higher net production revenue reflecting a 94% increase in origination. ","And in Card, Merchant Services and Auto, revenue was up 9% driven by higher card NII on loan growth as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8% and sales up 10% reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season. ","Expenses of $7.2 billion or up went by 2% driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business including market expansion largely offset by expense efficiencies. On credit, this quarter CCB had a net reserve release of $150 million. This included a release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $250 million reflecting improvements in delinquency and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in card of $100 million driven by growth. Net charge-offs were $1.4 billion largely driven by Card and consistent with expectations.","Now turning to the Corporate and Investment Bank on Page 7. For the fourth quarter, CIB reported net incomes of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year. For the full year, CIB delivered record revenue of $38 million and an ROI of 14%. In Investment Banking, IB fees reached an all-time record for the full year. It maintained our number one rank in Global IB fees and grew share to its highest level in a decade.","For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 billion was up 6% year-on-year outperforming the market which was flat. Advisory fees were down 3% following a record performance last year. On a sequential quarter basis, fees were up meaningfully as we benefited from the closing of some large transactions and for the year we ranked number two in gain share. Debt underwriting fees were up 11% year-on-year due to higher bond issuance activity as clients accelerated their funding to take advantage of attractive pricing conditions to strengthen their balance sheets.","And for the year, we maintained our number one rank overall and we were number one for reinvest positions in both high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Equity underwriting fees were up 10% year-on-year reflecting strong performance in the US and Latin America. The new issuance market continued to be active and for the year we ranked number one in equity underwriting as well as IPOs. Our overall pipeline continues to be healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for debt issuance.","Moving to markets. Total revenue was $5 billion, up 66% year-on-year driven by record fourth quarter revenue in both fixed income and equity markets. Fixed income markets was up 86% benefiting from a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year, but also reflecting strength across businesses notably in securitized products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows. ","Equity markets were up 16% driven by strength across cash and primes. Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion down 3% year-on-year, primarily due to deposit margin compression which was largely offset by organic growth. While security services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 3%. Expenses at $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal volume and revenue related expenses, as well as continued investments.","Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8. Commercial banking reported net income of $938 million and an ROI of 16% for the fourth quarter. And for the year $3.9 billion of net income and an ROE of 17%. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower margins largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on the strategic investment. Gross investment banking revenues was $634 million, up 5% year-over-year driven by increased large deal activity.","Full year IB revenue was a record $2.7 billion up 10% on strong activity across segments with record results for both middle market and corporate client banking. Expenses of $882 million were up 4% year-on-year driven by continued investments in banker coverage and technology. Deposit balances were up 8% year-on-year as we continue to see strong client growth. Loan balances were up 1% year-on-year. C&I loans were up 2% driven by growth in specialized industries and expansion markets, partially offset by the runoff in our tax exempt portfolio.","The CRE loans were up 1% where we continue to see higher origination in commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.","Finally, credit costs were $110 million with an NCO rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by a single name which was reserved for in prior quarters. Underlying credit performance continues to be strong.","Now on Asset and Wealth Management on page 9. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $785 million with pretax margin of 28% and ROE of 29% for the fourth quarter. And for the year AWM generated net income of $2.8 billion with both pretax margin and ROE of 26%. Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuation and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression.","Expenses was $2.7 billion were up 1% year-on-year and for the quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $14 billion driven by fixed income and multi assets and we had net liquidity inflows of $37billion. AUM of $2.4 trillion and overall client assets of $3.2 trillion, both records were up 19% and 18% respectively, driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into long-term and liquidity products.","Deposits were up 8% year-on-year driven by growth and interest bearing products. And finally, we had record loan balances of 8% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending.","Now on to Corporate on page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $361 million. Revenue was the loss of $228 million for the current quarter driven by approximately $190 million of net markdown on certain legacy private equity investments. Sequentially revenues down $920 million due to lower rates. The benefit recorded in the prior quarter related to loan sales as well as the PE losses I just mentioned. Year-on-year revenue was down also primarily driven by lower rates.","Expenses of $343 million were down $165 million year-over-year due to the timing of our contributions to the foundation in the prior year.","And turning to Page 11 for the outlook. At Investor Day, as always we will give you more information on the full-year outlook. However for now, I'll provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. We expect NII to be approximately $14 billion market dependent; adjusted expenses to be about $17 billion and as a reminder the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation adjustments and as a result is currently estimated to be approximately 17% just to manage tax rate about 500 to 700 basis points higher. ","So to wrap up, 2019 was a year of record financial performance across revenues, net income and EPS. Our outlook heading into 2020 is constructive underpinned by the strength of the US consumer and despite expected slower global growth in the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, we remain well-positioned as we continue to build on our scale and benefit from the diversification of our business models.","And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","Our first question comes from is Kenn Usdin of Jefferies. ","KennethUsdin","Thanks, good morning. Hi, Jen, how are you? Jen, I was wondering on terms of the NII outlook you talked about the $14 billion level. Obviously getting to a point of stability. Can you help us outside of day count, can you help us understand just where we are in terms of repricing of the balance sheet? What happens if rates generally stay flat from here just in terms of the rate side of the equation if we hold volume aside?","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. As we look at rates paid on the retail side, we didn't obviously have reprice on the way up. And so there's little to do on the way down. In fact, there from a rate paid perspective we continued in the fourth quarter to see rates pay pick up a little bit on migration from savings to CDs. And then on the wholesale side, we did see rates paid come down as you would expect and we could see betas accelerate after the second cut. So there we saw more of a decline in CIB than we did in CB or AWM as you might expect.","Importantly though as we only spend on the wholesale side, we price the client by client and so we're not going to lose any valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta. And then I would just say in terms of the outlook with the Fed on hold, the implies do still have one cut later in 2020 and based on the latest implies we'll give you more detail at Investor Day as we always do, but I would say NII for the full year of 2020 flat to slightly down as a headwind from rates will be offset with balance growth. ","KennethUsdin","Yes, got it. And just on --one question on just the volume side of things. Ex the mortgage loans sales last year you're still on that like 3% core growth. And obviously talked a lot about thus the environment and how there's been some settling out, but at a lower level. Just what's the status of just corporate and commercial customers now that we're closer to phase one getting finalized. UMSCA's on the table, just-- what's the backdrop of just economic activity as you guys see it.","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So the fourth quarter definitely I would say stabilized things, trade certainly stabilized things broadly speaking, stopped getting worse. And so we saw sentiment improved a bit which I think contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter and then certainly there are some puts and takes. I mean that US consumer remains in a very strong shape both from a credit perspective sentiment spending. Obviously, labor market is very strong and the Fed and the ECB on hold and then capital spending is still a bit soft, but sentiment is at least certainly better than it was six months ago. So we have a broadly speaking constructed out located in as we're heading into 2020 year. ","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.","SaulMartinez","Hi, good morning. I have a question on credit and CECL. And you guys have been pretty clear that your business decisions are based on economic outcome or economic outcomes and not accounting outcomes and but CECL does materially change the way in which time -- changed the timing in which earnings accrete to book value in capital obviously with a higher upfront hit. But you guys have also been shifting your loan book pretty materially towards cards with which has much higher loss content than your total book.","So I guess twofold question. One is how do we think about provisioning in this context? Should we think provisioning is going to be well above charge-offs as your reserve ratio moves up, because I would think your ALLL ratio post CECL adoption which is I think is about 1.8%, 1.9%. It should move up as card which has a much higher loss content than that continue to grow in the mix. So just how we think about provisioning in the context of the mix shift and CECL's adoption.","And then I guess, secondly, if there is a change in the macro environment and in the credit environment does get worse and CECL that inflection goes through your reserves and your provisioning. Is there a point where CECL actually does change the way you think about pricing and underwriting in that environment?","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So I'll start with the provisioning. So, look, I think it's fair to say under CECL you could have incremental volatility given that reserves are more dependent on specific macro economic forecasts. But there that would depend of course on our ability to have foresight into the timing and extent of those downturns. In cards specifically as you say, in any one period of growth or downturns you could see an increase in reserve and expense that we're taking, life of loan first is the next 9 or 12 months. So that's true and then on the wholesale side you could see some differences of course because there are modeling differences between specific macroeconomic forecasts and through the cycle. Having said that, we continue to believe that incremental volatility would be material for us and of course net charge-offs is not changing.","And then from a price perspective, we don't foresee in the near term any pricing changes. The cash flows with the customer have not changed. And so we don't see any but it is true as you rightly point out that there is an increased cost of equity in the sense that we're taking reserves up front versus through time. So over time you could see that but we're not expecting it in the near term.","SaulMartinez","Got it. I guess on the provisioning side my question is more just on an ongoing basis is the mix changes more towards higher loss content lending which obviously have higher margins and higher profitability through the course --over the course of the loan in theory but like in that context I would --is it fair to say you're provisioning levels also could be materially above your charge-offs because I would think that your reserve ratios, your ALLL ratios do have to move up is that mix changes on your balance sheet.","JenniferPiepszak","It could be, it could be. So that's just timing particularly on the card side. It's just timing but it's difficult to know again because it relies on our ability that has perfect foresight into the timing and extent of a downturn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","ErikaNajarian","Hi, good morning. So I was hoping to get a little bit more credit on what happened in the quarter to produce such stellar results. Understand that obviously the fourth quarter 2018 comp was light but $3.4 billion is so you know a pretty heavy number for a fourth quarter for JPMorgan. So and any color you could provide would be very helpful, Jennifer.","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So you are talking about market, Erika? Yes, okay, sure. So they're --at Goldman in early December, I did say we expected to be up meaningfully. I'm saying the performance was broad-based in rates we call out securitized products. I'm sorry, in fixed income, we call out securitized products and rate which were bright spots but broadly speaking obviously equities got a very strong quarter as well. So it's really across the franchise and we saw very strong client flow and we had success monetizing those flows. So just a very healthy environment for us and really strong performance.","ErikaNajarian","Got it. My follow-up question is that a quarter ago and two quarters ago the revenue backdrop for banks in general when the outlook was starting to deteriorate. And I think management had gave us in color that you'll continue to invest your efficiencies and initiatives no matter what the changes are in the revenue environment. But you could cut back on certain expenses if revenue environment was changing. That being said, your revenue production seems to always outperform to the upside. So if you think about 2020 is the best way to think about expenses just at 55% overhead ratio.","JenniferPiepszak","So, look, on the efficiency ratio, yes, I would say that like we've run the company with great discipline whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle but because the efficiency ratio is an outcome not an input and is about expenses and revenue, we're not going to give a target for any one year. We think about operating leverage over time and we always say we're not going to change the way we run the company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds. And expenses, I would just say that at Investor Day last year Marianne told you that we expected the cost curve to flatten post 2019 in 2019 adjusted expenses were up 3%, 2020, we expect them to be up less than that.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.","MichaelMayo","Hi. Is Jamie on the call? I'm sorry.","JenniferPiepszak","Yes. He is.","MichaelMayo","Okay. So just a question for Jamie because in the first paragraph you mentioned easing trade issues helped market activity. And I know this is a very simple question, but can you talk about the connection between easing trade issues and better trading. And you said that was better toward the end of the year. Is this something that you expect to remain or is this a one-off quarter?","JamesDimon","That's a really hard question to answer, Mike. But obviously trade born a lot of consternation that has eased off a little bit. I don't think it's going to completely go away. You still have actual ongoing trade issues of China and Europe and stuff like that. I think because that sentiment got better trading got better so they're going- how long that continues we don't know.","MichaelMayo","And then, Jennifer, you mentioned expense growth was 3% it should be less than that this year. You guys had also mentioned that your technology spending might be leveling off. So as those levels off maybe you see paybacks from prior investment. Any sense of where tech spending will be this year versus the prior year and how you think about that? And I know we'll get more at Investor Day.","JenniferPiepszak","Sure, of course. So I think you can think about tech spending on a fully-loaded basis being in line with what I described for the company. And we continue to realize efficiencies from investments in tech but as you well know it's we continuously invest in tech and so there's a fair amount of velocity in the investment portfolio there as investments roll off. And we're investing in new technology and innovation. So you can think about tech spending as being broadly in line with how I describe the company in terms of trends.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","BetsyGraseck","Hi, good morning. Two questions, one on asset growth in the last couple of years fourth quarter, you have to go through this exercise of trying to squeeze down to hit the G-SIB target. And then in addition this year I think you sold some residential mortgage loans to investors or at least the investors are taking the risk of it. And then you're requesting to have regulatory capital reflect that transfer of risk to an investor pool while you're keeping the customer relationship. When I see these things I'm wondering how you're thinking about how much room you have for asset growth as we go into 2020 and is there an opportunity to potentially do more of this residential mortgage loan trade to free up space for growth. Maybe could speak to that?","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So I mean we're bound by standardized capital and so of course that is a consideration for us. And one of the reasons that we're looking to structured loan sales as you describe in the mortgage business. So we think that there's more we can do there. And then on G-SIB, we remain hopeful that we will see the refinements there and recalibration that the Fed has been talking about for some time because that will become increasingly difficult. So both are at the margins constraints for us but broadly speaking I wouldn't say that that we are constrained given where we are on our capital ratios.","BetsyGraseck","And as I think about CECL, appreciate the commentary you had earlier on the call. I'm just wondering a couple of things. One why do you think you ended up towards the low end of your $4 billion to $6 billion increase in reserves that you outlined earlier? And what kind of estimates you have for the economic outlook? You've got the assumption for the economic outlook in the reasonable supportable period et cetera and so I'm just trying to understand what kind of forecast you have in your model so that I understand what's embedded in your scenario and in your ALLR ratio.","JamesDimon","Sure. So we, I think we ended up at the low end as we through the year continue to get more certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like. And so I think that's really what's driving it obviously portfolio mix as well continue to be very strong in terms of performance of the portfolio. And then on the estimates for the economic outlook, as you rightly say there is the reasonable and supportable period which for us is two years and so we do use multiple weighted scenarios there. So we weight multiple scenarios with the one most likely getting the greatest weight and that's where you end up with what looks like a reasonably benign outlook for the reasonable and supportable period which also obviously would contribute to us hitting the low end of the range.","JamesDimon","Jen, are we going to disclose some of those variables over time? ","JenniferPiepszak","That's a great point, Jamie. I should say that, yes. We, I mean there will be more disclosure about CECL in the Q.","JamesDimon","Which means all the banks are bestowing these ridiculous forecasts and going forward and differences? We'll spend time talking about that as opposed to the actual business, but we will disclose we need to know to make it clear what we're doing and why we're doing it.","JenniferPiepszak","That's right. So you'll see more in the Q's.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","MatthewO'Connor","Good morning. Two quick follow-ups to some things that have been talked about. I guess first on expenses, full-year outlook was pretty clear less than 3% growth, but the first quarter seems a little bit higher than the maybe I would have thought up 4% year-over-year. And I don't know if that's just rounding and I'm getting too obsessed over $100 million here there or if you're up funding some investment spend, and if so, what that's for?","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So the first quarter tends to be a bit higher for us if you look through history. And so but there you can think about it comparing it year-over-year. We have volume and revenue related expenses increasing a bit of an increase on investments, but both are being partially offset by expense efficiency.","MatthewO'Connor","Okay. And the other follow up question is just on capital allocation, obviously, it's a good problem to have but the ratios keep going up, the capital generation keeps going up; the stock keeps going up. You're obviously buying back a lot of stock. The goal is to get the dividend, I think, higher over time but let me just talk about how you think about buying back stock at these levels. If there's other call it creative uses of capital like I always think about all the money you spend with technology. And does it make sense to buy technology versus do it organic? So just maybe address some of those things. Thank you.","JenniferPiepszak","Sure, so on the ratio, I'll just remind you that of course we have our capital distribution plan approved once a year. And so since our last CCAR filing, we have realized some RWA efficiency and we've out earns relative to the assumptions in the CCAR filing. And so that's part of the reason why we've seen the ratios float up there. On stock buybacks, as you rightly point out our first priority is always going to be to invest for organic growth. And so we are always looking to do that first and foremost and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend and only then to distribute excess capital to shareholders through buyback. And we have said that it makes sense to continue to do that at or above 2x tangible book which is about where we are now.","We will obviously --when distributing excess capital always be looking at the alternatives but at 17% ROTCE and 2% or 3% dividend payout ratio there's a high bar for the alternatives.","JamesDimon","You are absolutely right about acquisitions. We did do InstaMed this year which hooks up is electronic, system that hooks up providers and consumers of healthcare. Well, I think the numbers are 80% and 90% is still done by check. So there are opportunities like that we absolutely would be on the hunt for them.","JenniferPiepszak","That's right. We did last year, yes. ","JamesDimon","And we did a year before. ","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","GerardCassidy","Hi, Jennifer. Question on credit. You obviously put up some real good numbers once again on credit quality. And I noticed that you had a nice material decline in the wholesale non-performing assets quarter-to-quarter. Can you give us any color on what brought that down and could you tie in also any concerns that you may have about the energy portfolio? I know it's not material but there are some concerns out there about energy credits.","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So on wholesale non-performing loans in the CIB that was some name specific upgrades that we had in the CIB. And then in the commercial bank that was related to charge-offs taken in the quarter. And then on energy, really nothing there thematically I would say like any sector. We have upgrades and downgrades and this quarter was no exception. But I wouldn't say anything thematically in our portfolio that we're concerned about.","GerardCassidy","Very good. And then I don't know if I heard you correctly in the last answer to the stock repurchase program. I understand of course it's driven by your CCAR results, but if the price of the stock and it's a good problem to have gets to a level that you consider to be too high. I think you may have said 2x tangible book value. What then happens if the price of it gets to a point where you guys think it's just too high to buy it back? What do you do with the excess capital at that point. Have you --given that much and again it's a good problem to have I understand that but if you give it any thought to that. ","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. We give a lot of thought to it and I agree it is a high-class problem. And so we said that at or above 2x tangible book make sense. If it continues to go up we're going to continue to look at alternatives. Most importantly within the company in terms of how we should really think about the return on buying our stock back at a higher level versus perhaps thinking about the returns a bit differently in terms of organic growth. Jamie, I don't know, if there's anything you want to add?","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.","StevenChubak","Hi, good morning. So, Jennifer, I wanted to start with a question on capital. Quarles indicated in a recent interview that he plans to implement the bulk of the SCB in 2020 CCAR. Also alluded to the possibility of deploying a counter-cyclical buffer as part of that. I'm just wondering if the countercyclical buffer is actually deployed or incorporated within the test. Is that something that's underwritten as part of your 12% CT1 target and are you anticipating changes to the G-SIB coefficient calculations that you allude to earlier in the call as part of the coming cycle as well?","JenniferPiepszak","Thanks Steven. So I mean you touched on a number of things that are all important. And I think what's most important to us is that we end up with a cohesive framework across all of them. The comments from the Vice Chair has been constructive in the sense that he always reiterates that he thinks that level of capital in the system is about right. And so we'll have a firmer view when we see a final rule. As you say, we do expect to see something in 2020 based upon the comments that we have heard just like you have. And we expect that our 12% target will not be impacted because we do constructively hear the Vice Chair say over and over that the amount of capital in the system is about right. And then but we can't have a firm view until we see the final rule.","And then on G-SIB, we remain hopeful that we're going to see the refinement that the Fed has been talking about perhaps not full recalibration until Basel IV which is what the Vice Chair recently said, but certainly there are a number of refinements that we've been talking about and the Fed has been talking about for years and that we remain hopeful that we'll see them very soon.","StevenChubak","Thanks for that color, Jennifer. And just one final one for me. We saw really strong FIC results as well as really strong institutional deposit growth. And I was hoping you could speak to what impact the Fed balance sheet growth is actually having on all of your different businesses or how that's manifesting? Because it seems to be providing a pretty nice tailwind, whether it's some increased activity as well as some benefit in terms of deposit growth that you're seeing across the overall franchise, but institutional in particular.","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So you are absolutely right. On the wholesale side, the Fed balance sheet extension was a for sure a tailwind for us. Although, I would say the more meaningful portion of our deposit growth on the wholesale side in the quarter was from strong organic growth and client acquisition. [Tech Difficulty] pension was the tailwind and elsewhere I would say obviously it was the right thing to do. And provided stability in the repo markets throughout the quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","BrianKleinhanzl","Good morning. A quick question on the deposit cost. Could you just break down maybe by segment where the big drivers were, that saw -- you saw have the big reduction in deposit costs, linked quarter. Was that in security services or was a wealth management?","JenniferPiepszak","Sure, Brian. So on that -- I'll start with retail where we saw raise pay pick up a bit and that's on migration from savings to CDs. We have seen CD pricing come off its peak, but continued migration from savings to CDs. And then on the wholesale side, you see bigger declines in rates paid in treasury services for sure. And then a little bit less so in the commercial bank and AWM. And again as we always say these are named specific client by client decisions. And while we feel good about where we are, these are decisions we make client by client and we're certainly careful and have a lot of discipline not going to lose valuable relationships over a few ticks of beta.","BrianKleinhanzl","And then a separate question. In the commercial bank, I mean you seen loans come down quarter-on-quarter for end of period and generally modest growth year-over-year. I mean what's the sentiment now in the middle market and the corporate client? Is it a sentiment issue? Is it just timing issue? Therefore seeing better loan growth.","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So there are obviously some puts and takes which I'll run through but broadly speaking I would say what we're seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand and in C&I, we feel good about the growth that we're seeing in the areas where we're focused and specialized industries and market expansion, but of course that offsets partially by the tax-exempt portfolio that's running off and then in CRE good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunities there given the rate environment.","And then that is offset by real estate banking where we are very disciplined given where we are in the cycle.","JamesDimon","I would just add as capital expenditures come down all things being equal which they're not, but all things being equal you see a reduction in some lending. These companies need less money to pay off receivables and inventory and planting equipment.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","GlennSchorr","Hello there. Hi. A quick question on open APIs and what the big picture is here and how it impacts you and the rest of the banking industry, meaning there's this concerns over data security and things like that but JPMorgan has some plenty of agreements with some of the bigger providers. I'm just curious to get your big-picture thoughts on what level concerns we had? What are the good and the bad?","JenniferPiepszak","Yes. I mean there I would say, Glenn, our customer's data privacy and security is of utmost importance to us. And we think over time the best way for us to do that as securely as we can is to have third-party apps only access data through our APIs. And so we are working name by name to get those agreements in place. And we hope through time that is exclusively the only way that third parties can access our customer's data. We think that's the most secure way to do it.","JamesDimon","But very importantly is that that data is the data the customer agrees to give them on the basis they agree to give it to them, does not unlimited access to customer data and the customer will have the ability to turn it off, as opposed to today if you gave your bank pass code to someone they're taking the data every day maybe even every minute. And you don't even know that if you forgot.","JamesDimon","Great point and we're going to make it super easy for our customers to be able to do that.","GlennSchorr","So you will -- you will give them the tools to control that.","JenniferPiepszak","Yes. You can imagine the dashboard where they will have --","JamesDimon","That is the full sense. ","JenniferPiepszak","Yes. ","GlennSchorr","And then just curious if you've seen any follow-on impacts that you've seen some repricing on parts of the illiquid markets, and for specifically some of the unprofitable parts of those companies. And is that just the repricing and everybody that owns them will take some hits a little bit slower progress on banking front and that's it, or is there anything bigger there to worry about with what's going on in the illiquid side?","JamesDimon","Each of the target companies?","GlennSchorr","Yes. I am sorry.","JamesDimon","Yes. Look, there are lot of private companies they -- a lot of do well, some don't, some of fail, some have access to capital now, they won't have access to capital in a downturn, but it's not a systemic issue. It's just the other capital market there are a lot of private companies. And so I don't think it's that big a deal, you just have an adjustment and access to capital that will happen periodically.","Operator","Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","MarlinMosby","Thank you. Jennifer you were kind of foreshadowing lower tax rate as you kind of move into the first quarter and then the tax rate here in the fourth quarter was a little bit lower than what we expected. Is there anything that's permanent here? Are there some things that are just kind of rolling through these two quarters?","JenniferPiepszak","Yes. They're -- I wouldn't say there's anything permanent there. The first quarter is typically lower for us, Marty. You can think about full year 2020 as being 20% plus or minus and of course that would depend on any non-recurring items we might have or any change in regulation but about 20% plus or minus and then of course the managed tax rate is typically 500 to 700 basis points higher than that.","MarlinMosby","And then a bigger question when we came into 2018 the net interest margin was around 2.5% and then now as we're coming out of 2019, the net interest margin has fallen below 2.4%. So interest rates went up 100 basis points and then down 75 and we've netted down in negative 10 basis points. So I was just curious in that path it's either the way the Fed kind of inflected very quickly that created a little bit more pressure in the net between deposit pricing and loan pricing. Or do we think that this is probably just some of the competition that came in after the tax reform and maybe this is just the evidence of some of that competition with the increased profitability that we got from the benefit from the taxes?","JenniferPiepszak","Yes. So there I would say, Marty, on that sort of the last several hikes there was some catch up there because we had some lags on reprice in the rising rate environment. So if you just looking at the last few hikes the betas would certainly be higher than what we're seeing in terms of the first 3 eases here, but broadly speaking on NIM, I mean we don't -- NIM is an outcome for us not an input and as we think about looking forward certainly the environment is very competitive, it always has been and NII the outlook for 2020 is at this point based upon the implies flat to slightly down. And we do expect balance sheet growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.","AndrewLim","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could give a bit more color on your market's performance there? Obviously it's done very well geographically is there much more weighting there on the US versus Europe and APAC?","JenniferPiepszak","I would say, Andrew that it was broad based. We can have Jason and team follow up specifically on a geographic breakdown, but it was largely broad-based.","AndrewLim","Right and would you say with confidence that you're gaining market share in both territories there?","JenniferPiepszak","Again, I don't have the split on market share by region but Jason and team can certainly follow up on that.","JamesDimon","Yes. I'm not sure, we want to start disclosing that regularly. I do believe that market share went up in pretty much in most markets, but you can't say most markets and all products.","Operator","And our next question is from Alison Williams of Bloomberg Intelligence.","AlisonWilliams","Good morning. So I had a similar question just circling back to trading and the CIB more broadly. So obviously the bank has gained share but can you speak to future opportunities and runway and maybe this is more of a question for Investor Day, but specifically businesses like cash management, transaction banking and corporate clients in general. You're a leader in the US anecdotally. We hear US banks have been making gains in Europe. Can you speak at all to that opportunity?","JenniferPiepszak","Sure. So as you said we'll give you more color at Investor Day for the Treasury services business, we feel really good about where we're positions. I think going forward they'll obviously be some rate headwinds there which we think can be offset by organic growth, but given the investments that we have made there, Jamie mentioned InstaMed earlier. We feel really good about the capabilities that we're adding and what we're seeing in terms of organic growth there. But we can talk to you more about that at Investor Day.","End of Q&A","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Jennifer Piepszak","Okay. Thanks everyone.","James Dimon","Thank you. Hope to see you guys tomorrow. ","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's call. You may disconnect."],"12373":["JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2016 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you and good morning, everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop. And while there were no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the impact of other notable items, primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you will hear about as I go through the presentation. And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IB fees compared to the first quarter, as well as strong core loan growth of 16% reflecting good demand across both consumer and wholesale and record consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion.","Before I go through the results, let me spend a moment on two topics that are top of mind. First an update on wholesale credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by oil and gas and metals and mining and those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases, so they were previously reserved which means underlying the net $50 million reserve build we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB.","Although the oil and gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been somewhat positive with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector improving access to capital markets. In addition, outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our wholesale or consumer credit portfolios.","Second on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk off environment and following the decision, the markets were quite volatile as expected and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath. The market functioned quite well absorbing the volatility and despite significant increases in volumes our systems were stable and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance. With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the U.K. and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and possible things specifically will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked.","We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately patient. The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and U.K. clients across businesses and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex, ultimately we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction cost so that they will be manageable for the company.","Moving on to page two. Revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year-on-year on higher net interest income. For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve and as industry deposit re-price to-date has remained low coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth. Noninterest revenue was flat year-on-year with the increase in markets revenue being offset by declines in IB fees as well as asset management. Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million reflecting continued progress against our commitments. We still expect the full year expense $56 billion, plus or minus, as the second half of the year includes our expectation of an increase in the FDIC surcharge in the third and fourth quarters.","Moving on to capital on page three. The firm's advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.9%, which standardized at 12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6% as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth. This quarter, we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Finally, we are pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan and the Board authorized gross repurchases of up to $10.6 billion.","Moving on to page four and consumer and community banking. Consumer and community banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers.","We had record deposit growth again this quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Average loans were up 11% with core loans up 23%, driven by mortgage and auto but with continued strength across all products. And we had record business banking loan originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and with a strong pipeline up 17%. We added nearly two million households year-on-year with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter reflecting strong acquisition trends including the launch of Freedom Unlimited.","And finally, our active mobile customer base remains the largest among U.S. banks up 18%. Revenue of $11.5 billion included some non-core items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a one-time gain on Visa Europe and negative mark-to-market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII of the added $14 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue.","Card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was up, but flat if you exclude the non-core items I mentioned, with growth in card and auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down to 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitments allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. Finally, credit trends across the consumer businesses continued to be favorable with charge-offs in card trending up slightly.","Over the last two, three years we have responsibly expanded our credit box in card, in the prime and near-prime space. As this vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate and performance is in line with our expectations. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly and as such, we built $250 million of reserve this quarter.","Moving to auto credit. Competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained our underwriting discipline with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry and with a very sharp focus on avoiding mislayering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations and we have built $50 million in reserve this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against this reserve build, we saw releases of $125 million principally driven by mortgage.","Turning to page five and the corporate and investment bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2 billion and an ROE of 15%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked number one in global IB fees, ranking number one in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter that we ranked number two globally and grew share by 50 basis points. In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter, but was down from a strong quarter last year with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continued to rank number one globally growing share by 30 basis points and we ranked number one in every product category for the first half of this year. Debt underwriting fees were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with the market which was down 4% and we ranked number two globally.","Moving on the outlook for fees. Given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of 2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve and we expect DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance offset by lower acquisition finance. Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8% reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year-on-year.","As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our client's needs, execute their transactions and provide liquidity. Fixed-income revenue of $4 billion was up 35%, versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter with strong performance in rates and currencies in emerging markets on higher client flows and performance also improved in credit and securitized products as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity.","Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of $235 million were driven by reserve build for oil and gas. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year with a comp to revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%.","Moving on to page six and commercial banking. Overall, a solid quarter for commercial banking, with net income of nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was up 23% sequentially and flat year-on-year. And we continued to see strong momentum in loan growth with average loan balances up 13% year on year. Commercial real estate loans grew 18% reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking and C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both corporate client banking and middle market.","Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth and expense of $731 million was up 4% reflecting continued investments in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by oil and gas but almost fully reserved and outside of energy, credit performance continued to be strong.","Moving on to page seven and asset management. Asset management reported net income of $521 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year-on-year as we continue to fill the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower legal expense and recall that the prior year included a non-core loss. AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year-on-year, respectively.","We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continue to see strong net inflows in to our fixed income products with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset. Our long-term investment performance remained good with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by mortgage up 20%.","Turning to page eight and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million which included two notable items. There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter, offset by a number of tax items, including addition to tax reserves for developments relating to open order periods. As a result of the tax items, our managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%, adjusted it would have been closer to 36%.","Now turning to page nine and moving on to the outlook. To reiterate, our firmwide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent. So to wrap-up, a strong quarter reflecting our leadership positions and the benefits our diversified franchise with the consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses. We had a good result in markets continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment.","And just before I open up the Q&A, just for those of you on the phone, Jamie is here. He has a very hoarse voice. So we will try and use despairingly. But if you hear him coarsely, that's why. Operator, open up the line please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[AUDIO GAP]","Comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Foran","I know it's very early and it is probably limited in what you say, because you mentioned, it depends on the timeline of Brexit and how passporting works, but is there any kind of qualitative thoughts you can give us around the operational and\/or legal issues we should be watching as this develops, legal entity, restructuring, net impacts of moving people versus lower cost geography, some things like that?","Marianne Lake","Brian, I know that everybody is keenly interested to hear what we have to say but the truth of the matter is, it's very, very early days as the new government is just forming as we speak. Negotiations need to be given some time to unfold and take shape. And so it's really too early to hypothesize. But we would hope that we can continue to operate where we are right now. But we will just continue to evaluate the landscape, as I am sure you will, over the coming weeks, months and quarters and plan accordingly. The most important thing is that we intend to continue to support our European franchising clients throughout.","Brian Foran","I appreciate that. And maybe switching gears, you mentioned the consumer business was firing on all cylinders. Clearly there is some nervousness in the market that the credit cycle is turning. So I wonder if you can tough on two things which are, maybe a little bit more detail on the seasoning impact you saw? You mentioned, in card, is it just seasoning or is there any like-for-like deterioration? And then in auto, you mentioned risk layering. What particular factors are you seeing layered in to underwriting box that make you concerned right now?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So on the card space, as you know we have loans running off or replacing them all the time over the course of the last couple years. Since the end of 2013, we have made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully and we have been monitoring it very closely. And what we are seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations. And these loans are coming on at higher risk adjusted margins. So the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. so nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectations for our credit risk appetite. And with respect to auto, not to speak for others, but obviously, when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs and longer terms on top of each other in an environment where you have already seen used car prices soften some and they are likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. And so we have been very, very thoughtful about that, not just today but as we been going through the cycle and not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry but we have been very, very careful and low percentage of subprime originations very, very careful about looking at those layered risks. So nothing in our -- and remember for this year, I think the charge-off rate is going to be 40-ish basis points compared to a long run average of more like 60. So we are reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. And used car prices will ultimately come down and we are being thoughtful about that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hi. Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just talk a little bit about the net interest margin and the outlook there. It was down five basis points. It looked like it was mostly in the funding cost. I just wanted to get a sense of what was driving? I think long-term was up. Trading, liability cost were up. Can you just give us a sense of what's going on there and how to think about that going forward?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So at the risk of not getting overly complicated, the long-term debt expense to our NII was flat with loan growth and NII loan growth being offset by long-term debt expense which was largely to do with the hedging of non-dollar debt and just relative quarter-over-quarter small move in currency levels and currency basis. So I would honestly characterize it, not to underplay it, as quarter-over-quarter noise. Looking forward -- and so when you look at our NIM, you have NII flat, you have the balance sheet growing as we expected both on loans and trading assets. So NIM just naturally is down a few basis points. But we would be looking for our NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter and so our NIM to be relatively stable.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one follow-up on the prior question on credit. How should we think about the provisioning going forward in consumer? Is that going to be a consistent build? Or is that a catchup that we saw this quarter?","Marianne Lake","So I would say, there is going to be two things. First of all, obviously, when you talk about consumer, it dwarfed by cards. So let's start with cards. We are growing the portfolio. We added 4% core loans year-over-year in card and so naturally as the portfolio grows over time, you would expect to add to reserves. So there will be some of that, but I would characterize it as modest. And then as these vintages continue to season, we have been experiencing very, very low loss rates, circa 2.5%. They will trend up slightly. And so there will be a little bit of rates impact too but again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. So I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors, but for all the right reasons. And similarly volume wise in auto, we should see some adds but again, in comparison to card, modest.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning. So my first question is, given how well JPMorgan did on the fee car relative to last year's results and it seems like RWA and SLR exposure have stabilized over the past few quarters, how comfortable are you perhaps allocating more balance sheet to the investment bank, given that you seem to be very well positioned to continue to gain market share, especially end markets?","Marianne Lake","So as you know, Erika, everything that we do, we do with a view to, first of all, the client franchise and making sure that we are supporting our clients and then secondarily with a view to all of our binding constraints. So we will provide capital and access to the CIB, but also taking into consideration our overall objective is making sure that we stay in the 3.5% bucket. So we will continue to try and find capacity to be able to recycle it and grow high ROE business.","Erika Najarian","Great. And was there anything to call out on the equities, the $1.6 billion equities number that could be a little bit more one-time in nature for the quarter?","Marianne Lake","Not anything significant, no. I think you have got to compare it to the prior year, which was stronger, particularly this time last year in Asia and that's less true today, stronger in Europe, less strong in Asia. It's more of a regional story than any particularly significant items.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, two questions. One, on the outlook page, I see on the printed page, it's the same as what you had last quarter for the company overall, obviously, but I heard the emphasis on NII was on the plus side, right, $2 billion year-on-year plus. Is that the rate nuance that you are trying to communicate?","Marianne Lake","Yes. Two pieces to the story. So yes, the guidance is $2 billion plus year-on-year. You recall, when we came in to Investor Day, we said we would expect $2 billion rate flat. It looks like rates will be flat at least in the front end at this point, at least for the majority of the year, if not the whole year. But you have seen already in the first two quarters that year-over-year we are up $1.4 billion, so we were doing better now on a combination of lower deposit bases, re-prices and also on strong loan growth. But if you annualize that, that would be too high. We are going to have some impact in NII of the lower tenure. It's not significant but it will offset that to a degree. So we would expect our NII to be between $2 billion to $2.5 billion, up year-on-year, largely strong loan growth, lower re-price.","Betsy Graseck","And then on the loan growth side, you have been funding this in part from just a mix shift, right, where your loan to deposit ratio has moved up very nicely. It's still very low at 66%, but up two percentage points Q-on-Q and up from 61% year-on-year. And I am just wondering how far do you think you can take that before you might want to look to fund loan growth with deposit growth more ratably?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So obviously we have been doing a combination. We have been growing our deposits more strongly than the industry. So we continue to be net net attracting more deposits than the industry and also as you say, a mix shift out of securities and into loans. Our outlook for loan growth for the range of this year is to be at the higher end of our range. We said 10% to 15% core loan growth and at this point, demand still seems robust. So we would expect to be at the higher end of that range and we certainly have been this quarter. So at this point, I would say that it's a combination of factors. And remember, the way we think about investment, security portfolio also takes into consideration how we think about positioning the firm's duration of equity. So all of those factors will contribute.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Good morning. Just one more rate question. As you mentioned, you are supersensitive on the front end of the curve and you just alluded to, the curve is flatter. I am curious about that great chart that you rolled out on Investor Day that talks about, we make $3 billion more through 2018 if rates stay flat and $6 billion more if the curve goes down the implied path. The implied path is now lower. I am just curious how much those numbers change if the current curve holds?","Marianne Lake","Okay. Glenn, I apologize, but I think it was actually, we make $3.5 billion on the rates implied and $6 billion on normalized rates. But in any case, let me just talk about rates flat versus implied right now just because things can change so quickly, I will just focus on 2017. Rates flat from here, so with the tenure of about 1.5 and IOER at 50 basis points, because of the loan growth notwithstanding any long end pressure, we would still expect year-over-year our NII next year to be up between $1 and $1.5 billion. Implied, which is actually not that much different from that, so it does have about 20 basis points better long end rates by the end of 2017, but otherwise relatively flat through the end of 2017 would be about $0.5 billion more than that.","Glenn Schorr","That is perfect. Thank you. Other question was, there are some regulars chirping a little bit about concerns in commercial real estate. Some of the other banks have mentioned that you are growing like a weed and your credit is great. So can we just talk a little bit about what you think you are doing differently to both, get that growth and then what you doing to avoid mistakes of the past, that will be good?","Marianne Lake","Growing like a sunflower, not like a weed.","Glenn Schorr","Fair.","Marianne Lake","So look, I will say a couple of things. So first is, a lot of that growth is commercial term lending and it is the case that we have the technology and the process that has speed and certainty of execution and competitive funding cost. So it is the case that if the value proposition that we are able to bring to clients that differentiates us, we are able to close in times that are a fraction of what the industry is. And secondarily, we are really concentrated on simplified supply constrained markets, low rent-stabilized. So these are not the same properties that had problems in the past. Since the previous cycle, we have looked carefully at the our underwriting and there are some things and some regions and some products that we either don't do or do significantly less of. So we are very, very careful but we are looking at some really good credit quality in our commercial real estate portfolio right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Marianne Lake","Hi Matt.","Matt Burnell","Hi Marianne. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on the cost side of things where the overhead ratios, both in the CIB and the consumer bank dropped really materially quarter-over-quarter. I guess I am just looking for some guidance here in terms of how much of the expense initiatives that you have already been talking about, both in the CIB and the CCB, how much progress did you make in this quarter on that? And was that an outsized contributor to the improvement in the overhead ratios?","Marianne Lake","So I would say, in the CIB there is also a revenue story. So you need to consider both factors.","Matt Burnell","Sure.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So let me talk about where we are on the expense commitments and you will recall that whether you remember, a $4.8 billion number or $5.5 billion number in total, we about 70% of the way through delivering against that across the CIB and the CCB at the end of the second quarter. We continue to make progress. In the CCB, obviously, it is generally more progressive. And the CIB, it is a bit more about technology and operations and it takes some time to deliver that. But fundamentally we continue to chalk through that and we will get there over the course of the next several quarters. So I would say in line with our expectations and it is a contributing factor.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just in the CIB specifically you mentioned the comp ratio there was 30%. That's sort of at the low end of the range that you typically talk about, 30% to 35%. I am presuming that's largely driven by the better-than-expected revenues. Was there anything else going on there? Or was that just pretty much a result of a benign revenue, a relatively benign revenue environment?","Marianne Lake","So I would say, the comp revenue ratio is an outcome, just for what it's worth. Obviously we try to give the range to give people an idea, but we pay competitively and we pay for risk adjusted performance. But there is nothing notable going on. We have been actually at the lower end of our range for a little while now.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Marianne Lake","Good morning Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. How is CIB doing in Europe and against European bank competitors in terms of revenue growth, share, the degree of competition? Some competitors are pulling back and you guys have stayed the course. Are you seeing the benefit from that?","Marianne Lake","So it's always a little tricky. The share thing is going to become clearer with the rearview mirror than it is necessary a moment in time. It does feel like we are doing fairly well competitively not just against European bank, but just generally and not just in Europe, but generally because we, as you say, have continued to be there for clients across products across the globe. So I would say that we feel like we are doing fairly well. We will know whether that is share gains when we are able to actually look at that in the rearview mirror. But there is still plenty of competition out there. And so we are just focused on serving our clients the right way. But it does feel a little bit like we are doing well.","Mike Mayo","And I know you were asked already about Brexit. Maybe if we can hear from you, Jamie, about the implications of Brexit? Marianne, you said, \"minimize friction cost\", if you can just give us some sense of what that means? You have given us lot of guidance about the recent quarter and the year ahead, but you have what could be a monumental event and you haven't really talked to investors about that since Brexit's occurred. So how do you think about currency risk, the cost, the revenues and are you delaying any investments, given the increased uncertainty?","Jamie Dimon","Yes. I am going to try to tell you as best as I can, if you can hear me. So number one, we do think it will reduce the GDP of the U.K. and the EU a little bit. Obviously, that's not going to affect our business plans. That will affect the economies a little bit. Number two, we know that it is going to create uncertainty for an extended time period. So we don't think we can answer or make certain all these things you want to know, because there a lot of parties involved. We are hoping that political leaders are very sensible. It makes sense for both the EU and for Britain to think through the process to make it sensible whatever changes they make in order to give businesses time, I am talking about years, time to adjust to the new reality which we don't know what it is. I think the most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients, day in and day out and if it costs a little bit extra, so be it. I am not really worried about it. I wish it would be nice if it doesn't create a huge turmoil. So I am hoping the EU is sensible. But we are going to be prepared. As Marianne mentioned, there is a range of outcomes and anyone in our shoes will try to be prepared for each one of them, but we are not going to pull back on serving people in Italy, Germany, France, U.K. or Spain, because it might lead to higher cost. I would accept the higher cost as opposed to disrupt our clients.","Marianne Lake","And I would also want to point out, Mike, that competitively we are not in this situation alone and so we are going to take our time to work out what the right course of action is. And obviously we will update you as and when that becomes clearer. But we are not going to at a competitive disadvantage, if anything, as we talked about earlier. We feel like we are in a position of strength.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just, first off, had a follow-up on Brexit. Post this development, have you seen any impact on your banking pipelines? Has this had any impact on appetite for M&A, particularly if there is a component that involves either the continent or the U.K.?","Marianne Lake","So the truth of the matter is, it's a very early phase and I hate to continue to repeat that, but I will tell you that generally speaking uncertainty is not particularly conducive or constructive for M&A. But in this case I think there are some offsets. So I would start with, in terms of the actual strategic dialogue with CEOs and at the Board, cross border, it is as good as it's ever been. And if you think about just the other factors that would be supportive of M&A, so like cheap financing globally, low organic growth, good multiples, solid economy in the U.S. and globally notwithstanding a bit of the steam taken out in Europe or the U.K., all of that should continue to be supportive for strategic M&A. Yes. So at the end of the day and currency could be supportive at cross-border activity. So there are puts and takes, uncertain that there will be some people who think carefully through the right timing and what to do. But at the end of day, the strategic proposition should ultimately win out in most cases and similarly volatility generally speaking, is not particularly conducive in terms of ECM but investor appetite is still there and there have been deals price prospects. So it's a little early, the selectivity. Volatility is reasonably subdued at this point and I think because there are no event calendars out there right now, there is still quite a lot of opportunity in the, sorry, obviously DCM low rates would be a tailwind notwithstanding the M&A in ECM landscape.","Brennan Hawken","Great. Thanks for that. And then one more on credit here. So it seems that we have 30-day delinquency rate actually go quarter-over-quarter. So it seems like maybe in the card business, so it seems like maybe a secure rate issue. Is that the right assumption? And then could you give maybe a little color on how much the non-prime growth has driven in recent in recent vintages versus prior?","Marianne Lake","So let me start with the second part of the question. So we are still very much contemplated in the prime and near-prime space, but we have a higher percentage of our originations in the near-prime space, reasonably meaningfully higher over the course of last couple of years. So where we may have previously been, I think 40% above, 760 now, that's less than that and there's more like 20% or 30% below 700, but at the end of the day, still pristine credit relatively speaking. With respect to the delinquencies, is it accrual rate issues, not specifically, no.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi Marianne. I am not sure if this is to early, but when you think about expenses longer term beyond this year, if you think about 2017, if we find ourselves in a similar revenue environment next year, when you wrap in your cost save objectives and where you want to be on investment spend, do you think you will be shooting for expenses to be in the same range of that $56 million next year, if things don't change on the revenue front?","Marianne Lake","So look, we are not really doing much in the way of 2017 guidance right now. It will ultimately honestly depend on the opportunities we see in front of us to continue to invest and to add customers and I think we are at a very good run rate of investments. We have increased reasonably significantly in terms of marketing dollars in auto lease growth and that will drive probability in the medium to longer term. So it's possible if we see opportunity to continue to do that we would do it. But we have no specific guidance yet.","John McDonald","Okay.","Marianne Lake","The revenue environment can change reasonably quickly, particularly as you know with rates and to a lesser degree, market. So we are not going to overreact to short term.","John McDonald","Sure. Just more near-term. You talked at a recent conference about the tax rate going forward. Just with the issues you had this quarter with the tax rate looking at 39%, you said it would be 36%. What should we think about going forward? Is it in that 36%?","Marianne Lake","Yes. Taxes, most likely, generally speaking, the reserve changes are somewhat episodic. Outside of those yes, 36% is a good central case for our managed tax rate.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak","Hi. Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Steven Chubak","Marianne, I had a question on the outlook. You reaffirmed the fee income from guidance of $50 billion plus or minus for the full year. And I am trying to gauge, just given the tough start to the year in trading in 1Q, the subdued second half M&A commentary and second half trading seasonality that we would typically expect, the $50 billion target does appear somewhat ambitious. And I don't know if you felt like that was a fair assessment or just given what you are seeing across the businesses that the $50 billion is still relatively achievable?","Marianne Lake","So starting with the qualification that obviously as you suggested, it's going to the market dependent, but also remembering that we knew when we gave guidance that we would expect the second half to be seasonally lower. So here is what I would say, first half market was challenged, second half the market was better. Net net -- sorry, first quarter market was challenged, second quarter better. Net net, first half relatively flat year-over-year. So call it with the acknowledgment that we knew we would expect seasonal declines in the second half of the year, mortgage better. So you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year-on-year actually by a reasonably significant amount given obviously where the rate environment is as well as some positive MSR results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat. And against that, to your point lower IB fees and lower asset management revenues, given the environment. So the way I would characterize it is, there are puts and takes, but net net it's still at reasonable central case. So we are not changing it. But it's market dependent.","Steven Chubak","Thanks Marianne. And just one more for me on CCAR. Just given that you have had some time to digest the latest set of results, the improvement in PPNR was probably the most impressive aspect of the release, at least based on our findings. But from what you could gather based on your own internal assessment, what were the primary drivers of the increase where maybe we have some limited visibility such as areas like op-risk? And does a favorable CCAR outcome inform your view in terms of which constraint is currently most binding and maybe how you might change your deployment across the different businesses?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So look, I would say, if you look at the last three years of PPNR, notwithstanding that there have been obviously differences in the scenarios, 2015 CCAR results, so not this year's but last year's were low, not to say that that means that these results are more normal. But I would say, if you look at the three years and look at the PPNR results now, it's more consistent with the portfolio risks the revenue generation we would expect and you can see that because it's much more consistent with our results. So I don't have insights that I can share with you specifically to try and reconcile the Fed's results year-on-year nor do we really try to do that. You are right, operational risk is likely a piece of it and that was disclosed in that information. So I would just say, there can be volatility, but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think that the PPNR would start and it's consistent. as you can see relatively speaking with what we calculated. In respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does means is if you look at the analysis that we have done a couple of years in the a row now where we have said using that the CCAR results from the Fed, what would that imply, our CET1 ratio would need to be to pass. It had previously being a little less than 11%. With the improved PPNR and therefore the improved results at this point it would be a little less than 10%. So in that context as we look forward sometime in the near future maybe in the third quarter to getting 2017 CCAR changes in proposed form hopefully it will alleviate to a degree, a little bit of that pressure. But I still would suggest you, as we said in Investor Day, that CCAR may, depending on how the G-SIB surcharge is included in the minimum, may become binding. It's not likely, it will become binding and so we will continue to take that into consideration as we go forward and we are already taking into consideration as we think about optimizing against the most binding constraints we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi. Yes, thanks. So a quick question on the mortgage originations. The correspondent channel didn't change all that much quarter-on-quarter, although it was with seasonality and a pickup in refis that would have increased in the second quarter. Can you talk about how you are thinking about correspondent mortgage origination? And given that refi volume looks strong at the start of the third quarter, should we expect a pickup in the correspondent in the third quarter?","Marianne Lake","So we think about using all of our channels based upon obviously, the demand and our capacity and our appetite as we want to continue to close strongly for our customers and we have obviously also been focused in the anticipation of it becoming a more purchase oriented market very much on building out the retail channel and the retail distribution channel and that's been very successful. So there is less correspondent contribution this quarter. It is a lever we will likely use going forward.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And I know you can't really discuss too much on the legal side, but is it the right way to think about legal expenses going forward, like an ordinary cost of doing business for a bank of your size? Is it 1% of revenues is kind of an ongoing run rate for expected legal expenses going forward? Or is that not the right way to think about it and it's just episodic?","Marianne Lake","Well, at this point, we would still say, it will be episodic. And while we are hopeful that the overall structural cost will start coming down or it has come down and that's a good thing, there will still be potentially some puts and takes in the legal space. There is no real way, obviously, of forecasting the run rate. I would just do what many of you have done, I think and go back and look at what the legal expense look like in the years preceding the crisis and make your own determination whether it's going to be structurally a little higher, but it probably wouldn't be multiples of that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Marianne Lake","Hi Ken.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Marianne, I was wondering just if you could, I know it's a little backward looking now and you have made your points already about what normal trading seasonality could be, but can you help us understand the products that drove the really strong fixed trading? And what happened in June? Was it volumes? Was it spreads widening? And then I would actually ask what you typically consider what normal JPMorgan seasonality is, as you mentioned?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So it was particularly strong rates but nevertheless also a very strong year-over-year in currencies, emerging markets, credit trading SPG. So I mean it was pretty broad based, but remember you also have to think about it relative to the equivalent quarter last year and we didn't have a particularly strong second quarter last year. So on a relative basis that is an important factor but it was pretty broad based. More volume than anything. And then seasonality, I am sorry. Look, it's anyone's guess and I think you can go back and look over time, but last year we had a weak second quarter, as I said and we didn't see as much seasonality. But if you look at the last quarter's run rate, I don't know if that would be a bad place to start. Last year's third quarter run rate would not be a bad place to start.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Okay. And the second question just is, on the wholesale reserve, you mentioned, it's been nice to see the energy prices start to stabilize and it seems like you are able to stabilize the amount of reserve build outstanding aside from that one credit. What needs to happen for you to get even more comfortable or you could see some of that reserve start to come out, underneath the context of that you are also growing the wholesale business extremely fast as well. So?","Marianne Lake","So I am going to start off with a couple of general comments which is, we talked about the fact that the charge-offs that we have experienced in the quarter were credits that we had previously reserved for. So we are at the point now where at least as a basic matter, as we are experiencing charge-offs, we feel like we are in a reasonably good reserve our position notwithstanding that idiosyncratic there may be additional adds. What we would need to see is continued firming of sentiment in the sector, continued access to capital markets to allow companies to prepare their balance sheet and continued stabilization, if not improvement in oil and gas prices. And so, everything is constructive on that path, but it needs to continue along the same path. And yes, we are growing our portfolio and so even if it were not for energy, we would, all other things equal, be adding to reserves. But there are also time to pay down lots of other puts and takes too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Marianne Lake","Hi Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi Marianne. Thank you. Marianne, can you give us some color. Obviously your consumer loan growth has picked up quite nicely. You pointed to, it's going to be at the higher end of the range for the year. What are your guys seeing on consumer behavior? Has it improved and they feel stronger about their own job prospects which is enabling them to borrow more? Are there any metrics that you guys are looking at from that end?","Marianne Lake","So I mean, just to say, we obviously have own spend data to look at and it continues, the card spend is up 8% year-on-year, energy continues to be a tailwind for consumers, the labor market continues to be solid and improving and sentiment is still good, housing still improving. So I mean, really just looking at the same things you are looking at and we obviously have a slightly different lens to it, but all other things equal, consumers are in very good shape and demand is there for the products. And we have been investing outside of consumer in new products -- inside consumers, sorry in the Freedom Unlimited space and also in marketing. So we are growing not only because the demand is there but also through investing.","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And then coming back to credit, obviously your first quarter results had the results of the targeted Shared National Credit exam for oil. Traditionally obviously we have the Shared National Credit exam every year and second quarter results normally reflect that exam. Do your second quarter results reflect the Shared National Credit exam?","Marianne Lake","Our second quarter result reflects everything that we have and we know of at the end of the quarter and we are not going to make any specific comments on regulatory events.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks. Marianne, just a couple of quick follow-ups on the auto lending business. The originations came down a bit and you talked about the dynamics around that previously in the quarter and at the Investor Day. But when I polled auto lender or auto dealers, they say that where they had primarily seen you retreat was from very high FICO, super prime new lending and leasing but their experience with Chase remained very consistent in the mid-FICO range. I just wanted to see if that was consistent with your view internally?","Marianne Lake","More specifically, I am not sure. I haven't polled the dealers myself, but we continue to have very high FICO scores and no, I am not aware of that. But I can't comment.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. And then just one follow-up on one auto credit. Obviously the Manheim issue points to perhaps some rising severity given default. But at this stage, is there anything that suggest to you that we should see a higher frequency of default?","Marianne Lake","In our portfolio at this point, no.","Operator","Okay. And your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul Miller","Yes. Thank you very much. One of the things about what we saw was mortgage rates, the tenure dropping down to record levels and mortgage rates probably following right behind it. Can you give us a little outlook? Are you seeing an uptick in refis? We are seeing the refi nexus go up very high and any outlook on where you think the mortgage market is going to be in the next quarter or two?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So we are expecting refi to be stronger in the coming quarters and the mortgage market as best we can tell will be at around $1.7 trillion to$1.8 trillion this year.","Paul Miller","And the other follow-up question is, there are some news articles out there about JPMorgan securitizing conforming loans. This hasn't really been done a lot by anybody. I don't know if you can address that, the economics behind that or what's the thought behind that instead of getting Fannie and Freddie wraps to securitizing yourself?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So we have done one and we are looking at more securitizations in the mortgage space and we are keeping a vertical stride where retaining the loans on our balance sheet or the securities on our balance sheet, I should say and in doing that we have been able to that private capital to take majority of the lower credit risk and get better capital treatment for ourselves. Yes, so in terms of the RWA that it attracts.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Thank you. Most of my questions have actually been answered, but just a quick follow-up on the credit card originations in terms of dipping down to the lower prime or below. You said something like 20% to 30% had FICO scores below 700 and I didn't know if that was for new originations or for the portfolio overall that you were referring to?","Marianne Lake","New originations.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the focus everybody has on the flattening of the treasury curve. But yet earlier you were able to say that going into the next year, you would see 2016 NII growth of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, only really fall to $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which means that that flattening of the yield curve is very manageable. Just talk about asset yields as your earning asset yield actually went up one basis point, what you have been able to see in the market versus what's happening in the treasury curve?","Marianne Lake","So I will just start by sort of orientating you on why that would be the impact for us and if you look at our balance sheet and you look at we have in fixed rate loans versus what we have in either IOER or in LIBOR loans, it's about $650 billion and so we are much more sensitive to the front end of the rate curve. And if you look at our earnings at risk disclosures, 100 basis point parallel shift would be around $800 million. And so, obviously we haven't seen and won't hopefully see anything of that order of magnitude. So that kind of gives you an ability to size up notwithstanding compounding why you have only seen our NII relative to prior expectations come down by that much.","Marty Mosby","In this particular quarter, your funding cost went up, is that a lag effect from the rate hike in December still just now coming through or was there something else maybe more unusual about funding cost that we saw that drove the margin down this particular quarter?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I think earlier on the call, somebody else asked the question and I made the comment that it's really more related to the results from our hedges of non-dollar debt, long-term debt. And so in the first quarter, dollar weakened and in the second quarter it strengthened and we had some currency basis in the first quarter that we didn't see in the second quarter. It really is, not to dismiss it, but it really is accounting nothing really else than that.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Marianne Lake","Hi there, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi again. Just a follow up on the card new originations. I know one of the key things that you have done for many years is to focus on relationship, lending relationship offerings. And so when I hear the 20% of the new originations are below FICO 700, is that a shift from the relationship strategy that you have? Or does it reflect the fact that you do have significant relationships on deposits, et cetera with folks in that FICO band?","Marianne Lake","Yes. No shift from our desire to want to be in with engaged customers and our rewards programs. Our products are all geared towards that. So it's really just a credit decision. And yes, we do have relationships with many, many customers in that still near-prime space.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Marianne Lake","Hi.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi. Thank you. As a follow-up, Marianne, your consumer business obviously has been very, very strong. Can you share with us the update on clearXchange expected to be rolled out to be later this year and what that might do to even grow the mobile business even more than it\u2019s growing now?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So look, obviously B2B real-time payments is very important to our customers. So therefore, it is important to us. It is also important for us as an in the industry that it's done in a safe and secure way. And so early warning, the fraud protection that they are able to provide as well as bank levels cyber security and the absence of the need to provide your bank credentials, we think is very strongly positive for our customers and we expect to see volumes grow across that. As you know we have QuickPay already and we saw reasonably significantly volumes, $21 billion on QuickPay last year and growing So, I would expect to see more and more P2P payments and it's good for our customers, it's good for us.","Jamie Dimon","So if you look at the whole payment space, Chase Paymentech has gained share, ChaseNet is doing very well, Chase Pay, we have signed up lots of different people and one piece of that is P2P. So today right now, if you use Chase QuickPay, it is very easy within Chase to Chase, it is just now as easy to open Chase to a bunch of other banks. I won't name now, but we just started rolling out and soon it will be rolled out to 60% of American banking accounts and then we are going to make it available to all banks. So you will be able to go P2P real-time through Chase QuickPay. There will be a special app for Chase QuickPay, but it will also be branded on other names which we haven't rolled out yet, which I think will be rolled out shortly. So I think it's a great success that the banks can get together and do this and it would be a great service which I think shows you the bank is making progress and you would have called prior fintech.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you for the color.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time.","Marianne Lake","Thank you everyone.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call.","This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.","We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us.","I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $6.8 billion, EPS of $1.68, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%, on $23-1\/2 billion of revenue. If you exclude tax adjustments, legal expense and net reserve releases, our adjusted performance was $1.32 a share with a 12% return on tangible common equity. And we've only adjusted for these three items because other small items that might be considered non-core netted to zero.","Underlying results were somewhat mixed on the back of market conditions. The consumer business had strong performance with loan growth across products driving overall firm-wide core loan of 15%. In the corporate and investment bank, we saw outperformance in investment banking revenue and solid trading performance. Commercial banking revenue was down driven by lover IB revenues in a declining market. And asset management revenues reflected lower market levels, driving weaker client sentiment and transactional revenues.","There were two significant items this quarter. First, tax benefits of $2.2 billion, the size of which speaks to the complexity of tax methods during the financial crisis. We took appropriately prudent position in our tax reserves and now we've reached resolution on those matters. The majority of this is in Corporate, with a portion in the CIB.","The second item is firm-wide legal expense of $1 billion after tax relating to a range of matters, but including the recently announced CDS settlement. Also reflected in our results is a net reserve release of $281 million pretax, which reflects a little less than $600 million of consumer reserve releases as favorable credit trends continue, offset by a build of a little over $300 million in wholesale, approximately $160 million of which is additional reserves associated with the oil and gas sector, given expectations that energy prices will remain lower for longer.","Getting over Page 2 and turning on to Page 3 and our balance sheet. We continue to make progress against our capital targets and, as expected, advanced and standardized fully phased in CET1 ratios in line with each other at 11.4% this quarter. Also we continue to expect the standardized ratio will be our floor from here. And the improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation.","We also built Tier 1 in total capital, adding 1.2 billion of preferred stock and 1-1\/2 billion of subordinated debt this quarter. We returned $2.7 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of net repurchases and dividends of $0.44 a share.","Firm and bank SLR were at 6.3% and 6.5%, respectively, with the increase driven almost equally by capital generation and a reduction in average assets. While we're on the balance sheet, you can see on the call-out on the page that on a spot basis our balance sheet is down $160 billion year to date and an incremental $32 billion this quarter, as we reduced non-operating deposits by over $150 billion, exceeding our commitment. Total deposits are only down $90 billion, reflecting growth in more stable balances, particularly consumer. Finally, with respect to GCIB, we estimate that today we are squarely in the 4% bucket given actions taken and final U.S. rules, as compared to 4-1\/2% at the beginning of the year.","Now let's turn to Page 4 and consumer and community banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $10.9 billion was down 4% year on year, driven by mortgage on lower net servicing revenue. We remain on track to deliver expense reductions versus our $2 billion commitment, and year-to-date expenses were down around $600 million reported and over $700 million adjusted for legal expense. Our headcount is down 10,000 year-to-date and more than 40,000 since 2012.","Underlying business drivers are strong, and based on the 2015 FDIC deposit survey which just came out, we grew our deposits nearly two times the industry growth rate. Average loans are up 8% with core loans up 23%. Our customer base continued to expand. We added 900,000 households during the year and our active mobile base is up 21%.","Moving to Page 5, consumer and business banking. CBB generated strong results, with net income of $954 million and an ROE of 32%. NII was down 1% quarter on quarter and 7% year on year, driven by spread compression, offset by continued growth in deposits. And non-interest revenue is growing solidly, up 5% quarter on quarter seasonally and 5% year on year, on continued strong debit and investment revenue. Overall expenses were down 3% year on year on lower headcount from branch efficiency.","We continue to see robust performance across key drivers. Average deposits were up 9%. And we grew deposits in all of our top 50 MSAs and gained share in nine of our top ten. Client assets were up 3% but down 4% quarter on quarter, broadly in line with the market. And net new money was positive $3 billion for the quarter. Business banking loan growth remained strong, with average loan balances up 6% year on year and originations up 4% from a strong 2014.","Next, mortgage banking on Page 6. Overall net income was $602 million for the quarter. Originations of $30 billion were up 41% from the prior year and up slightly quarter on quarter as we benefited from a strong pipeline and continued improvement in the purchase market. We continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, totaling $19 billion this quarter.","Total revenue decreased sequentially, primarily driven by lower net servicing revenue on lower MSR risk management. We expect non-interest revenue to be down around $250 million year over year in the fourth quarter.","Expenses of $1.1 billion were down 13% year on year despite higher volumes as we continued to manage down our costs.","On credit, we released $575 million of reserve, including $200 million in the non-credit impaired portfolio and $375 million in the purchase credit impaired portfolio, reflecting an improvement in both actual and expected delinquencies and the sustained improvement in home prices.","Finally, our net charge-offs were $41 million and approximately $60 million normalized. And this is a reasonable estimate for the near term.","Moving on to Page 7, card, commerce, solutions and auto. Overall net income of $1.1 billion with an ROE of 22%. And revenue of $4.8 billion was up 2% year on year, on higher operating lease income in auto, as well as card revenue up slightly, reflecting higher NII on volume, spread and lower interest reversals, offset by the impact of changes to some of our co-brand partnerships.","On our partners, we were thrilled to announce the renewal of two of our key partners, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. We look forward to continued investment and growth in these important relationships. And while we repriced to the current competitive market, our ROE target for the card business in total remains unchanged. However, expect the revenue rate for the fourth quarter to be 11.75% plus or minus. Expense was $2.2 billion, up 8% year on year driven by higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing spend.","On drivers, we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in volumes and transactions across our businesses. In card, core loan growth was 3%, sales growth was 6%. Commerce solutions volumes were up 11%, driven by continued strong spend from existing clients but also from the addition of new merchants.","Lastly, in auto, results continued to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car values. We saw average loan and lease balances up 9% and the pipeline is good. Finally, on credit, the net charge-off rate for the quarter was 241 basis points, and we expect net charge-offs of around 250 basis points over the medium term.","Turning to Page 8 and the corporate and investment bank. CIB reported net income of $1.5 billion on revenue of $8.2 billion, and an ROE of 13% adjusted for legal, taxes and reserve.","In banking, it was a strong quarter with IB revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% year on year. We continue to rank number one in global IBCs and rank number one in North America and EMEA> It was another outstanding quarter for advisory, up 22%. We grew wallet share by 150 basis points year over year, maintaining our number two ranking.","Equity underwriting fees were down 35%, generally in line with the market but from a particularly strong prior year. This quarter we ranked number one both in North America and EMEA. Debt underwriting was up 17%, driven by higher non-investment grade fees. We maintained our number one ranking, gaining 30 basis points of share. However, expect (these CM fees) be down year over year given the current pipeline.","Treasury services revenue were flat quarter on quarter but down 4% year on year on lower deposit spread, with underlying transaction volumes remaining stable.","Moving on to markets. Revenue of $4.3 billion was down 6% adjusted for business simplification, with mixed results in fixed income but another strong performance in equities. Fixed income revenue was $2.9 billion, down 11% adjusted. In macro products we saw a strong performance in currencies and emerging markets, driven by higher activity on the back of market volatility in Asia and Brazil. Rate was down slightly given a particularly strong September of last year. And commodities was down on low levels of client activity, again, compared to a strong prior year.","It was a low quarter in credit with lower volumes as clients were on the sidelines given the challenging market conditions. Equity markets had another strong quarter with revenues of $1.4 billion, up 9% year on year, driven by reasonably broad strength across products and regions, with good performance in cash, but particular strength in Asia and derivatives.","Security services revenue was $915 million, versus guidance of $950 million, given depressed market levels which impacted both revenues and assets under custody, with emerging markets, which is one of our more profitable segments, being hit particularly hard. If markets remain at these levels, fourth quarter revenues will also be lower than previous guidance.","On credit we saw a reserve build of $232 million, including $128 million for oil and gas.","Finally, on to expenses, total expense was up 2% year on year at $6.1 billion. Compensation expense was down 13%, with [inaudible] revenue ratio of 30% in the quarter, and non-compensation expense was up 14%, driven by higher legal expense, partially offset as we realized the expense benefits of business simplification.","Moving on to commercial banking on Page 9. Commercial banking generated net income of $518 million on revenue of $1.6 billion and an ROE of 14%. Revenue was down 5% quarter on quarter, driven by lower investment banking revenue, as we saw fewer large transactions in the quarter. However, the pipeline for the fourth quarter is solid and we still expect record gross IB revenues this year, exceeding $2 billion.","Expenses of $719 million were in line with guidance. Loan balances were a record at $162 billion, up 13% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter, driven by continued outperformance in commercial real estate where quarter-on-quarter growth of 4% exceeded the industry across both multifamily and real estate banking.","C&I loans were flat, in line with the industry. Mature markets were relatively flat, but we saw growth in our expansion markets, up 4% quarter on quarter. Credit performance of the portfolio remained strong, with no net charge-offs, and an $84 million increase in reserves included a modest build for oil and gas.","Overall, while results were mixed this quarter, the underlying fundamentals of the commercial bank remained strong. Pipelines are trending higher in C&I and remain robust in commercial real estate, our expansion market loan balances are up 20% year on year, calling activity is up substantially across client segments, and we've added around 400 new middle market relationships this year.","Moving on to Page 10 and asset management. Net income of $475 million with a 28% pretax margin and 20% ROE. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 5% year on year, driven by lower markets, which also drove lower transactional revenue, as well as the sale of retirement planning services in 2014 which drove $70 million of the year-over-year decline. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect revenues to show normal seasonality from this low base, assuming current market levels.","Expenses were relatively flat. And AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $3.3 trillion held up well and were relatively flat year on year, with negative markets and outflows driving a 4% sequential decline.","We were not immune to the impact of interest rate uncertainty in equity markets, and while we did experience overall modest net outflows, we had positive flows in our less market-sensitive multi-asset class and alternative platform. In banking we had record loan balances of $109 billion, up 7% year on year, driven by mortgage which was up 19%. And lastly, we continued to report strong investment performance with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years.","Turning to Page 11 and corporate. Treasury and CIO's [ph] result for the quarter were both close to home. The corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion, driven by tax benefits. And finally, firm-wide NIM was up 7 basis points quarter on quarter given the mix shift away from cat and securities towards higher loan balances and on an overall smaller balance sheet. Loans are the primary driver of nearly $250 million improvement in NII, and given market implied NIM and NII should be relatively flat in the fourth quarter.","Finally, our loan-to-deposit ratio improved 8 percentage points year to date to 64%.","Turning to Page 12 and moving on to the fourth quarter outlook. A few items to call out. First, you'll see we updated our adjusted expense target to $56-1\/2 billion plus or minus for the full year, which is better than our previous guidance and would equate to the fourth quarter adjusted expense being relatively flat to the third. We're expecting core loan growth of 15% plus or minus to continue in the fourth quarter.","And finally, on markets revenue. Starting with business simplification which will drive a 2% decline year on year, in addition, we expect to see normal season of the clients in the fourth quarter versus the third. And looking back over the last three years, that client has been on average about 15%. And so far in October, across asset classes, the markets are pretty quiet. Obviously we're only two weeks into the quarter and it's too early to give a specific guidance, but based on those facts alone, analyst estimates appear high.","Wrapping up, overall the Company performed quite well against the backdrop of interest rate uncertainty and volatile markets. We continue to invest in our businesses and the underlying drivers are growing strongly and we're gaining share. And we have more than successfully delivered against each of our capital, balance sheet and expense targets.","And just before I finish, on one of those investments we're making, I want to update you on the progress we're making on our payment strategy. We continue to capitalize on our leadership position in payments. We have unparalleled assets in our issuing scale, we have the largest wholly-owned merchant acquirer, our own closed-loop network in ChaseNet, and now a digital wallet in ChasePay, which will be launched more broadly this year.","The beauty of this is that we're able to bundle all of these capabilities together to provide better pricing and experiences for merchants, including access to data as well as a better and more relevant experience for customers. We expect to process more than $50 billion of Chase card volumes over ChaseNet in 2016, and Gordon will share more details at Money 2020.","With that, operator, please open up the line to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks very much. So I'm curious, the capital markets related commentary, I guess there could be hangover effect into fourth quarter, and I'm guessing that's the primary driver behind your analyst estimates appear high on fourth quarter. But could we talk about what you're actually seeing in terms of where the financial markets are maybe drawing the line, meaning, are the deals that underwriting you expect to fall off in the fourth quarter based on your pipeline, is that a function of timing that you think could come back next year, are these marginal deals where markets are drawing the line? I'm trying to get at the ultimate question of, is this the first time that SIC [ph] could actually grow in 2016 just because of the beat-down it took in the back half of this year?","Marianne Lake","So there are a couple of different questions in there and maybe I'll try and separate them. My comments about the seasonality in the fourth quarter were most particularly towards markets revenues and less so towards the IB revenue space. With IB revenues, it's a mixed story, so, talking now about the sort of banking revenues rather than the markets revenues. So the pipeline for M&A remains very constructive and really pretty good. So we're expecting to continue to have strength in M&A in the fourth quarter.","With ECM you saw obviously a pretty sharp falloff in activity in the third quarter. We have seen the pipeline in ECM, to the degree that that shows you visibility in the fourth quarter, which is somewhat limited, we have seen that build up. And so there is possibility that we'll be able to pull through some of that into the fourth quarter. But that will depend upon how the markets behave.","With respect to DCM, our sort of guidance there was that, you know, commentary really to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, and on relative basis, the pipeline is down. And it's really to do with the normal refinances are slowing and the maturity wall is smaller. But it's still healthy, just not going to be at the same levels that we saw last year.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Maybe just to follow up. In SIC [ph] in general, I know none of us have a crystal ball, but the slowdown in activity that we see, some of the clients sitting on hand, maybe you could separate that between any providing of liquidity and marks along the way, because we did see a real wide credit spread widening in the quarter.","Marianne Lake","Yeah. I mean, look, the situation for us in markets was one where, you know, where there was volatility, regardless of how you want to characterize it, and people were acting - our clients were acting on the back of that, we were able to capitalize on that flow, we were able to intermediate for our clients, but our capital (risk makes) money, and so we did pretty well where there was volatility. And where there wasn't, it was more about, to your point, more about low levels of activity, people on the sidelines. So it was just tougher to make money because less was happening, rather than anything else more significant than that.","But so far in the fourth quarter, I mean we're two weeks in it, too early to say, but there's not been a tremendous change in the landscape.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Marianne, can you talk a little bit more about the card business and try to help us understand, the card revenue pressure that we saw this quarter into the fourth, how much of that is the NII side of things and how much of that is kind of the partner repricing, and how far past the fourth quarter do those resets continue before growth can overcome it?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I would -- so, looking at the revenue rate guidance, so, remember our guidance previously had been you should expect our revenue rate to be at the low end of the 12%, 12-1\/2% range. The most important thing we want you to take away from talking about our co-brand partners is that we feel great about having signed up United Airlines and Southwest Airlines and partnering with them again for the medium term. And the economics of those deals on a standalone basis are still really very good, but the cobrand space is very competitive, and when any of those contracts are going to be renegotiated at this point, they're going to be renegotiated to competitive levels.","And so it's really the fact that we're seeing that is going to come through in our revenue rate in the fourth quarter, which is going to push it down to below 12%. And it doesn't change the fact that the ROE target for the business is still 20% and that the economics of those partnerships is still good.","And remember these --","UCR:","Just giving the numbers. It's $200 million a quarter for four quarters until last.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Got it. Okay. And my second question, just on, you know, in this tough revenue environment, first of all, can you just give us a quick update on the progress on the expense plans, and then, you know, any - does anything change given how tough this revenue environment has changed as far as either accelerating or digging in again? I know your prior comments have focused on obviously always needing to invest, but in terms of just your focus as you think about next year and building the expense budget against the environment that we're seeing.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I would say, first of all, we gave some expense goals in Investor Day to both consumer businesses as well as for the CIB. And those were I think pretty sizable goals, $2 billion in 2017 versus 2014 for the consumer businesses and $2.8 billion in 2017 versus 2014 for the CIB. And we are working through that, we are on track in both of them.","I think I said earlier that, adjusted, the consumer businesses in the three quarters so far are $700 million down year over year in expenses. So, against the $2 billion target, we're certainly getting there. And on CIB, we expected 2015 to be mainly about forcing out those business simplification expenses, and we've essentially done that too. So we're on track, we're pushing hard. We still have work to do.","We are always going to be diligent on our expenses, and generally speaking, at Investor Day we also said we're going to on or down, which is actually pushing hard to keep them down, but not at the expense of good investments in the business.","So, obviously we are going to respond appropriately to the revenue pressure but not overreact.","Jamie Dimon","I've spoken my whole life about good expenses and bad expenses. You know, bad expenses are wastes, things you don't need, you don't [inaudible] through processing, things like that. But we want certain expenses to go up. When we find marketing opportunities in card, we're going to spend. If the investment bank does better, the comp accrual [ph] is going to go up. So that's how we run the Company. It's not ever going to change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. Just to follow up to that last question. So, of the total $4.8 billion of expense savings, how much have you achieved? And if you're on track, why did the adjusted overhead ratio go backwards at 60% in the third quarter versus 58% in the second and 59% last year?","Marianne Lake","So, Mike, thanks for that. So, $700 million, if you adjust for legal expense in the consumer businesses, year to date we'll do some more in the fourth quarter. And year to date on business simplification, which I think in total was about $1.5 billion, we've done $1.3 billion. So in total, that $2 billion so far, obviously more work to do in 2016.","With respect to the adjusted overhead ratio, it speaks a bit more to seasonality of revenues than anything else.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right. And one follow-up. Clearly it's due to revenue. So the question, Jamie, if you could answer this, a simple yes or no question, is the economy getting stronger or weaker? And the reason I asked that, the jobs report from a couple of weeks ago seems to imply the economy is getting softer, yet your loan growth actually -- your core loan growth accelerated and you're guiding for a faster loan growth in the fourth quarter. So, is there noise in that loan growth figure or is the economy, based on what you're seeing, getting stronger and the jobs number is misleading?","Jamie Dimon","It's not a yes or no on.","Marianne Lake","I'll start and then you can yes or no at the end.","So, Mike, we would say that the U.S. economy is doing pretty well there. We're seeing good demand for loans in the consumer space and reasonably good sentiment in the business banking space, and our core loan growth numbers do show that. So there's nothing particularly funky in the loan growth numbers. We do our very best to show them in the right light.","I would take a slightly different perspective on the jobs report, the non-firm [ph] payrolls, and not to sort of overthink it, but while I know it was somewhat lower than people were expecting or possibly hoping for, it still at around 140,000 was almost two times what would be required to have stable unemployment. So, you know, it's only one report too, you can't overreact to it.","So it's not that we're seeing anything that's causing us any concern and our outlook for the fourth quarter is pretty solid I think.","Jamie, anything?","Jamie Dimon","Nothing to add.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, Marianne. You saw some very good improvement in the GCIB surcharge from the 4-1\/2 to 4, probably came a little faster than some of us expected. Do you have good momentum there to do more there? And how are you thinking about the trade-off, the cost benefit trade-off of pushing further down on that GCIB bucket?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So we did better than we had targeted for -- on our non-op deposits. We went -- we worked very, very hard, but we told you we would, on derivative, notionals, compressionals or Level 3 assets. It is absolutely the case, not to diminish the amount of what we've done and the progress we've made, that we obviously went after the most impactful, you know, least impactful to the clients, most impactful to the ratio, with the less revenue give-up first [ph]. And so we made great progress. It becomes increasingly, not exponentially, but increasingly more difficult for every next basis point.","So that's not to say, by the way, that we aren't continuing to work very hard at it and optimize and that we won't push further, but we're not at a place right now where we're going to target anything structurally below this, except for over the longer term just continuing to work through it. And our overall capital target, we're at 11.4% now, our overall capital target still in the short to medium term is still 12%.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thank you.","Jamie Dimon","I just want to add, in the new world, we have to obviously monitor and push down to all the business levels, GCIB, CCAR [ph], Basel, LCR and SLR, and we want to optimize all of them. So we're only doing this for a couple of years now, as we embed it in our systems, it was a better way to track and monitor it. Over time I would expect the GCIB will come down a little bit. So, you know, it only comes down in lumps, you've got to make a big difference to go from 43-1\/2, but when I say over time, I'm talking about years. I'm not talking about anything that's this quarter. We're very comfortable where we are today, but over years, yeah, you might change your business strategy, but I think it's a better thing not to be an outlier in GCIB.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thanks. So, just a question on the capital getting to 4% now with a goal over time to get to something lower, 3-1\/2, 3. Does it also give you more room for capital return request next year, Jamie?","Jamie Dimon","It has nothing to do with next year, Betsy. When I say over time, just it's happened that JPMorgan built a global corporate investment bank, 70% of it is financial institution and 30% corporate. We easily could have been built the other way around, it's who you focus on over time. So when I say over time, it might be quite easy for us to say over five to six years, let's focus more on the corporates and less in financials, and that will affect your GCIB fairly substantially. So that's what I'm talking about. It's nothing to do with CCAR [ph] for next year or anything like that.","Marianne Lake","A couple of really small points on CCAR [ph] for next year for what it's worth, is we were constrained in CCAR [ph] by leverage. We have issued $6 billion of preferreds in the year. We are reacting to try and make sure that we are managing our binding constraints or our most binding constraints. So we're working on that.","The other thing to note is that we're at 11.4% as we sit here now, so we're not gliding a long way from where we need to get to. And both of those things, together with obviously our profitability, should mean that we have incremental opportunity. But our range is 55% to 75%, and we hope to be in that range.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just TLAC [ph], I know we're still waiting for the Fed decision, but we did get FSA [ph] recently, anything in there that you can respond to us to how you're prepared for TLAC [ph]?","Marianne Lake","So, just a couple of things. First of all, I think the FSB [ph] thing was a sort of leak, so it's as good as it is. I will tell you that the news on structured notes was not strongly positive, but we hadn't banked on it being. So, not entirely pleasing but not disappointing relative to our sort of models and expectations.","Other things to pay attention to anyway are there's no change to the internal TLAC [ph] assumptions. The holding -- the clean holding company rule is one that we're watching out for. But fundamentally -- and then there was the timing. Is there going to be a substantially elongated transition period?","I would call it all sort of fairly marginal, so it hasn't changed the overall picture for us. We're at around 16% and we'll figure out the FSB [ph] that's leaked out, wasn't shockingly different, and we'll see how the Fed respond.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Good afternoon. Just maybe a question on NII and NIM. I think, Marianne, you said it would be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, yet you're still expecting some pretty strong loan growth. Just want, you know, if you can maybe discuss why you think it would remain flat in that scenario? And maybe a bit longer term, in an environment where we're looking at lower for longer potentially in the rates, how do we think about the NIM a little bit over the intermediate term?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So with respect to the fourth quarter, we are expecting our loans to grow, and overall net-net sort of rotation of our cash and securities to loans would be supportive of NII. But remember, the biggest boost to our NIM was associated -- or one of the big boosts to our NIM was associated with changing the mix, reducing our overall cash balances, and so where [inaudible] going on.","The outlook for the fourth quarter being relatively flat was associated with market-implied rates which are relatively flat. And so in the law of big numbers, that plus or minus a few basis points is what we're expecting.","With respect to looking out to 2016, obviously we don't know what's going to happen with the curve. If rates stay very flat, we should still have upward pressure on our NII associated with the change in mix of our balance sheet. So the fact that we've got a smaller interest-earning asset base and more loans and less cash and less securities should be supported, even on flat rates.","We don't know when rates will rise, but if market-implieds are followed or if the Fed does or anything like real estate, then that will be even more constructive. And remember, in the first year we got the biggest benefit from shortened [ph] rates in the first 50 basis points of them.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Right. I was hoping you would know when rates go up, but thanks.","Marianne Lake","No. Unfortunately not.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Yes, good afternoon. My question is on the credit outlook. The consumer reserve release has continued to offset the wholesale reserve build. And I'm just wondering, how should we think about how much is left on the consumer side over the next several quarters, especially given the 23% loan growth that we saw this quarter and your note saying that this momentum should continue?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I would say that, first of all, with respect to purchase credit impaired, with this release we did on the 375, that's our baseline expectation for that portfolio. So our baseline expectation is no material incremental reserve. Obviously if things improve and they're sustained, then there may be more reserve releases. But I wouldn't try and model those.","With respect to the non-credit impaired portfolio we talked about, you've seen our charge-offs at normalized 14 basis points. Our portfolio quality is really getting quite high. We're fighting through most of the significant risks. So, reserve releases will be more modest and a little bit more periodic. And several hundred million dollars next year, maybe 300 plus or minus, but not significantly more than that.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","And just my follow-up question, following on Ken and Mike's question on expenses, maybe I'll ask it another way. Over the past few quarters your adjusted overhead ratio was 58% to 60%. You noted that you think that net interest income could grow next year even if rates stay low. Could you potentially slide below the 58% to 60% band that you reported over the past two quarters relative to, you know, you mentioned efficiency target of 55% if rates actually normalize?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. I mean, look, our efficiency target at 55% was over three years or so, and we still will be driving to get to around that level, but it does, as you quite rightly mentioned, includes not just rates rising but a fair degree of normalization in rates. So we'll see what happens in 2016. Obviously it's possible. But we're not going to call an outlook on rates next year.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. First of all, Marianne, if I could, in terms of some of the credit numbers that you mentioned in terms of the oil and gas provisions. They seem pretty modest in the scheme of your more than $20 billion of exposure to that industry. How are you thinking about the redetermination process that started this quarter? And how would you guide us in terms of thinking about what the provisions could be in the fourth quarter following the redetermination this quarter?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So we've taken some modest reserves in the last few quarters and our overall reserve number obviously is consistent with our expectations based upon the outlook for oil prices. There was a redetermination cycle that we reserved for in the first quarter, and so there will be another one in the fall. We've been as forward-leaning on that as we can be.","Obviously I'm not saying that there may not be any net incremental reserve build, but we're not expecting them to be significant. A lot of companies have tried to adjust their expense basis and otherwise help their position.","So if energy prices stay around these levels and recover slowly, we're expecting net not to have material incremental reserves in the next quarter. We may see some.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then in terms of mortgage banking, you noted that production -- the production amount was actually up quite nicely year over year, but the revenues in terms of production and also in servicing were a bit weaker, certainly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but the expenses were relatively stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is there something going on there that we might see further improvement in the expense space in the mortgage side of the business in the fourth quarter or are we sort of -- are you at where you think you need to be in terms of the $1 billion to $1.1 billion a quarter in that business?","Marianne Lake","So just let me deal first of all with production quarter over quarter revenues. Margins are down -- margins are down for two principal reasons. So, remember, quarter over quarter, at least on a closed loan volume, we were at a consistent level. Margins are down because we moved -- our mixed shift towards correspondent from retail towards purchase from refi, as well as capacity in the industry, you know, more capacity in the industry, and therefore less constraints. So the production quarter-over-quarter revenue is more of a margin number than anything.","With respect to year over year, I do want to make this clear, with respect to the guidance year over year that we should expect non-interest revenue for the mortgage company in totality, to be down $250 million, that brings our total year-over-year NII [ph] down around $1 billion, maybe a little more, which is what we guided to at Investor Day. And it's more off the back of lower repurchase reserve releases, lower gains on Ginnie Mae sales and [inaudible] against [ph] the, you know, sort of non-fee-based revenues that are to do with third-party UPB, as well as runoff in the UPB. So it's consistent with our guidance. It wasn't fully reflected in everyone's models.","I think there was a third part to your question, but I have -- oh, expenses, yes. Thank you.","And on expenses, in the -- there are two -- so we continue to work very hard in our expense equation, both in terms of managing down the -- particularly in the servicing space by the way, managing down the default inventory in a number of different ways, but also investing in our operating model, so, in technology, to improve the production, operations, cycle, process, also in our site strategy.","So, no, we are not done. We continue to work very hard at it. We have made great progress, but we continue to work hard at it.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Hi. We've seen some assets change hands, and you guys have been mentioned as a buyer for some of the other assets that are out there. Just wondering on what the ability and appetite is out there to buy loans.","Marianne Lake","So, look, obviously, we're not going to comment on anything specific. We would be willing to take and we do take a look at things when they come up. And if we are able to price for the risk and it's in a client segment or an entity [ph] we like, we might be interested. But there's no -- we have no special comments on it.","What we're really interested in is growing our underlying core loans with our customers that we can continue to do business with.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","And then just separately, following up on energy, how exactly do you kind of reevaluate the portfolio? Is it as a default cap and that's where there's a big boost to reserves, or you get in front of that?","Marianne Lake","So, not if default [ph] happen. I mean it's to do -- it depends on whether it's reserve-based lending or whether it's not. But as companies are either downgraded or as they are experiencing change in financial condition or the borrowing base is redetermined, we will act accordingly. We try to be as forward-leaning on that as is possible, but it's not, you know, we don't have perfect insight until some of that information becomes clear. So that's the process.","Jamie Dimon","And the reserve-based lending, you basically take essentially current prices, you discount at a discount rate, you assume expenses, you have to really engineer your cores [ph] and things like that, and you see if you can make -- roll over the loan at a sound, call it 65% LTV, and we think it's pretty good. That's what we're here for, to lend to clients, particularly in tough times. You can't be a bank that every time something goes wrong you run away from your client.","And then we also do things like stress test that down to $30 oil, maintain $30 like 18 months and say, which -- how much more reserves [inaudible] put up? And I think somewhere, and you correct this number, Marianne, we're not in the same room, that if that happens, we think we're going to have to put it in $500 million or $750 million in reserves, which is just not something we worry a lot about.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Hi, good evening.","Marianne Lake","Good evening.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Marianne, I appreciate your commentary on the preferred issuance that you guys have done so far throughout the year. It looks like you're now above the 150-basis-point target. You alluded to that being a function of efforts to manage to your binding constraint on the CCAR [ph]. I just wondered if you guys have a sense as to what -- how you guys are thinking about issuance plans going forward.","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So it's obviously a really great question. Unfortunately, we really don't guide to our sort of forward-looking issuance.","You're right, we are above 150 basis points right now. And we're also working on our leverage balance sheet. So we're working at the sort of dials exactly as you would expect us to, but we are not going to make any comments about forward issuance.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Understood. Had to give it a shot.","Marianne Lake","Yup, I got it.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","So, just moving to the investment banking side, and maybe trying to just dig a little bit deeper into some of the guidance you've given on M&A. It looks like the backlogs and expected completions for the fourth quarter are quite healthy, at the same time, post the August volatility, some of the historically strong M&A indicators like market cap, CEO confidence, those measures appeared to be deteriorating. I just wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the M&A outlook beyond the fourth quarter, just given some of the weakness that we've seen in some of those measures.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So the pipeline for 2016 is building up, so we don't have perfect visibility yet. We think, obviously, the deals that were being done in 2015 were skewed towards larger deals and we think there may be flown in 2016, but it looks pretty healthy for us so far, but it's building up.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Marianne Lake","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. Good afternoon. Marianne, can you share with us, you mentioned that you've built out 400 new relationships in the middle market area of the commercial bank. But when we look at the loans outstanding, they're essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, whereas the corporate client business has grown very rapidly. Can you give us some more color behind what's driving those numbers?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I mean, I think over the last several quarters, and forgive me if I'm slightly wrong, but I don't think I'm entirely wrong, our sort of C&I growth has been broadly in line with the industry. Remember that over the course of 2013 and 2014, we did a lot of work on simplifying our businesses, and that had an impact on the pace of our loan growth. But our mature markets are performing well. We're seeing growth in our expansion market. We're adding new clients. We're calling our prospects. So, everything is set to continue to see growth more going forward than we have in the past.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Okay. And then you talked about the reserve build in the CIB about $128 million was for oil and gas and the total number was $232 million. What was the other areas that required reserve building this quarter?","Marianne Lake","There was about, in CIB, there was about $47 million of metals and mining, about net-net $20 million of BAU growth, and then just a few other normal BAU puts and takes, downgrades, upgrades.","Other than those three things, there was no one specific fall-out.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer","Mine were asked and answered. Thank you.","Marianne Lake","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Yes. On your mortgage banking side, I've noticed that your jumbo loans -- or not your jumbo loans, that your residential loans in your balance sheet's grown. Are they mostly jumbos, are they coming out of your normal production, that $29 billion, and you're selling less to the government? Can you add some color around those numbers?","Marianne Lake","So, of the $19 billion that -- of the $19 billion that we put on our balance sheet, around 10, just a little over 10, was jumbo. The rest was conventional conforming.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","And then, are they mainly ARM loans or are they fixed-rate loans?","Marianne Lake","We'll have to [inaudible].","Jamie Dimon","I think the jumbo is like a third ARM. I've got to confirm that these are all fixed. That's what I remember.","Marianne Lake","We'll confirm for you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities","Thanks very much. Marianne, if I can just follow up on some of the consumer credit quality metrics. At the Investor Day and subsequently Gordon was indicating, unsurprisingly just given the very low levels that the expectation should probably be for some moderate rate of deterioration, and yet we haven't seen it. And I'm guessing that's partly because of the underwriting that's occurred over the past few years.","So my question is, what are the circumstances in which we should expect more significant deterioration there? Is it only macro or is there something else competitively that could influence that at this stage?","Marianne Lake","So you are right that, at this kind of 2-1\/2%, one of these base point levels in card, it does speak to the quality of the loans we're originating and the engagement with the customers, which is much more now about driving, yes, some NII, but really, really good spend and therefore lower credit quality. It's sort of an integrated equation.","We're expecting, given our originations and the runoff portfolio are the worst loans running off in the portfolio that we're building is really very, very clean. We're expecting that those charge-off rates to be low for the short to medium term, the readout for the next year for sure. There will be a combination of things that would drive that. It would -- but largely it would be environmental. We don't expect at this point we have made changes to our credit books, but they aren't material changes, and we'll continue to test our appetite to want to do that, and that may have an impact. But we're originating the vast majority of our cards in the super-prime sector.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities","And is -- are the dynamics similar in auto as well?","Marianne Lake","Similar, yes. I mean we're, compared to the industry, our originations are skewed to the prime space.","And our LTVs are lower. And the -- our durations are in line or lower.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Yes, hi. Just a quick one at this point. Equities, Marianne, you highlighted strength in Asia, which I think probably was better than maybe some had expected given some of the volatility. So, could you give us some color on the trends you saw in that region in your equities business?","Marianne Lake","Well, I would -- the biggest comment I would make is that there was a lot of volatility, particularly in China in the second part of or the last part of the second quarter. We were -- we did pretty well, we helped our clients, we didn't have significant open risk position, we weren't very directional, so we were able to do well in that situation. Also in the reverse, also on currency moves.","So really -- it really is the comment I made about we're here to serve our clients. They were transacting. We were able to do risk intermediation [interj] for them. And so we kind of made money on both ends.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Thanks for that.","Operator","You have another question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Marianne Lake","Hi.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. Hi, Marianne.","Quick question on your consumer business. You guys have shown very strong steady growth in the mobile users. I think it's over 22 million in this quarter, that's up from 18 million a year ago. Can you share with us what percentage of your customers are actually mobile users, and how does that compare to a year ago? And where do you -- what does Gordon think, what's the penetration rate that you think you can finally get to there?","Marianne Lake","So let me just talk qualitatively for a second and we'll get you some numbers. But we're focused on mobile and digital primarily because it's going to be great for the customer experience. It's what our customers want. And also because it's a significant enabler for reducing cost to serve and improving efficiency. So we've been very focused on whether it's quick deposit, whether it's quick pay, whether it's our mobile wallet, whether it's our mobile app, and we've been seeing great results.","I'm, off the top of my head, not able to tell you the penetration rate, but we can get back to you.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Okay. And is there any evidence that you guys can point to where you're actually taking market share from other banks because your mobile products are just more superior than some of the smaller regional banks and community banks?","Marianne Lake","I can tell you that we are growing our deposits nearly twice the industry, that -- so I think that's a reasonable indication for a bunch of different reasons, and that we have a very highly rated app -- I think the most highly-rated bank app, but we'll check that too.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Okay. And then finally, your asset yields jumped this quarter, which was good to see of course. Can you share with us how the Fed funds rate went up as much as it did sequentially? And also your securities yield went up in the quarter sequentially. Can you give us some color behind both those numbers? Thank you.","Marianne Lake","So on the Fed funds and reverse repos, we had moved towards higher-yielding, for example, emerging market assets. So we got some higher yield there. We saw some yield on our trading book moving out of assets of emerging markets. So, just a bit of puts and takes.","And on securities, was it significant? I'm sorry, I'll come back to you.","Operator, any more?","Operator","There are no further questions.","Marianne Lake","Thank you everyone."],"12228":["JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation. It\u2019s available on our Web site and please if you could refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","So starting off on Page 1, the Firm delivered strong performance this quarter. Net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.54 and a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $24.5 billion.","The quarter\u2019s performance was characterized by strong underlying fundamentals across each of our businesses with stable NIM and NII, good growth in fee drive as well as strong IB fees, good expense discipline with adjusted expenses flat quarter-on-quarter at $14.2 billion and an adjusted overhead ratio of 58% and low levels of charge offs and core loans up 12% year-on-year.","We also made significant progress on our balance sheet and we\u2019ve delivered on our non-operating deposit commitment. While there were no significant items this quarter, there were some small items that are worth calling out. On the positive side, we had consumer loan loss reserve releases of a little over $300 million as well as a little under $300 million of a benefit in DVA\/FVA on wider spreads. Against that we saw reserve builds across wholesale of $250 million of which approximately $140 million related to oil and gas, as well as Firmwide legal expense of a little less than $300 million.","If you take those four items and net them, together they contribute to zero to net income. So finally included in the result is $330 million of a benefit from tax discrete items. If you adjust all of those our net income is strong at $6 billion.","Skipping over Page 2, and on to Page 3, we continue to make progress against our capital targets with the Firm\u2019s Advanced Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio retain a 11%, up 35 basis points quarter-on-quarter and Standardized Fully Phased-In with a 11.2%.","The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction to risk weighted assets primarily from lower risk across market and counterparty credit as well as some data enhancements with loan growth offsetting run off.","We continue to build Tier 1 capital adding $3.4 billion of preferred stock this quarter and we return $3.6 billion of net capital to shareholders including $1 billion of net repurchases and dividends of $0.44 a share. Preferred issuance together with a reduction in average assets drove the Firm\u2019s SLR to reach 6%.","For more details on our balance sheet reduction, turn to Page 4. The last quarter I told you that you should expect us to make meaningful progress on our balance sheet in this quarter and we did just that.","Year-to-date our balance sheet is down over $120 billion on a spot basis, driven by a reduction of over $100 billion of non-operating deposits across our wholesale businesses partially offset by continued growth in consumer deposits. We also saw a $36 billion reduction in trading assets and secured financing as we continue to make progress simplifying our balance sheet. ","On the previous page you may have seen that HQLA was down $82 billion this quarter, primarily reflecting those lower levels of cash. However, the firm remains LCR compliant, given the significant outflow assumptions that was associated with those deposits.","In addition, the reduction in deposits together with strong core loan growth resulted in improved loans deposit ratio, up 5% since year-end. These balance sheet actions translated to relatively flat NIM, up 2 basis points quarter-on-quarter and NII. Quarter-on-quarter the reduction in cash drove a 4 basis point improvement was partially offset by lower yields and as I said, Firm NII was flat.","Turning to Page 5 and Consumer & Community Banking. The performance for the combined consumer businesses was characterized by sequential revenue growth on stronger fee revenue and positive operating leverage, generating $2.5 billion of net income, an ROE of 19% and an overhead ratio of 56%.","Revenue of $11 billion was down 4% year-on-year driven by mortgage, but up 3% quarter-on-quarter on seasonally higher credit and debit sales volume as well as higher MSR revenue.","Our focus on customer experience continues to drive growth broadly and we\u2019ve 19% core loan growth driven by mortgage. Also our active mobile customer base is up 22% to over 21 million customers and we\u2019re the largest and fastest growing among major U.S banks, reflecting our strategic objective to have a best-in-class mobile offering.","We remain focused on our commitment to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014, while continuing to self fund investments in the business. In the first half of this year, expenses were down approximately $0.5 billion versus the same period last year, and our headcount down roughly 6,000 year-to-date.","Moving to consumer business banking on Page 6, CBB generated net income of $831 million, flat quarter-on-quarter and down 8% year-on-year with an ROE of 28%. Net interest income was flat sequentially with modest spread compression offset by deposit growth and NIR was up 7% seasonally and 2% year-on-year on continued strong client investment and debit revenue.","Expenses were up 1% year-on-year largely due to increased legal costs. Excluding these, expenses were down 2% due to continued improvements in branch efficiency. We continue to see robust performance across our drivers with attrition well below industry averages. Average deposit balances up 9% or $41 billion year-on-year and we\u2019re pleased to see that 30% of this growth is driven by our investments in Business Banking and CPC and new builds.","Client investment assets were a record, up 8% to $16 billion and in Business Banking Average loan balances were up 6% with loan originations flat against a record last year and in a highly competitive environment. Stepping back and looking forward to the second half, our NII is stable and will increase when rates rise. Non-interest revenue is growing solidly and expenses will decrease, so we expect positive operating leverage.","Mortgage banking on Page 7. Mortgage net income was $584 million for the quarter. Originations were $29 billion, up 19% quarter-on-quarter, on seasonal increases in the purchase market.","We continue to execute our strategy of adding high quality loans to our balance sheet. Totally $19 billion this quarter and the origination pipeline continues to look strong. Total revenue increased sequentially, primarily driven by higher MSR revenue, but as you can see -- you look at our non-interest revenue it\u2019s down $500 million year-on-year. We still expect non-interest revenue to be down about $1 billion for the full-year in line with previous guidance.","Expenses of $1.1 billion were down $200 million or 15% year-on-year and down 9% quarter-on-quarter despite higher volume as we continue to manage down our costs. On credit, we continue to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and as a result we released $300 million of NCI reserve this quarter and you can see our charge-off rate were 21 basis points.","Moving on to Page 8, Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto. Overall net income of $1.1 billion, up 30% year-on-year and an ROE of 23%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year-on-year on Card sales volume and Auto loan and lease growth, partially offset by spread compression.","The Card revenue rate for the quarter of 12.4% was up quarter-on-quarter seasonally. Expense was down 4% year-on-year, driven by lower legal expense with a recent settlement regarding debt sale and collection practices having previously been reserved. And in Card we saw core loan growth of 3% and sales growth of 7% with delinquency rates and charge-offs remaining low.","Commerce Solutions continue to experience strong growth with volumes up 12% year-on-year, driven by continued strong spend and the addition of new merchants. We\u2019ve recently signed several new strategic clients, including Chevron, Cinemark, Gap Inc., Marriott and Rite Aid. Together they represent an incremental 5% to our volume and the majority have signed up for ChaseNet.","Lastly in Auto, results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car values. We saw average loan and lease balances up 8% year-on-year and the pipeline is healthy.","Moving to Page 9 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. So before I dig into the numbers, we did make some reporting changes this quarter. If you look at the top of the table, investment banking fees is now named investment banking revenue and principally this now incorporates the revenue share with the commercial bank here in this line rather than in the market revenues where it was previously being reported.","Additionally, trade finance revenue which was previously reported in treasury services is now being reported in lending. So digging into the numbers, the CIB reported net income of $2.3 billion on revenue of $8.7 billion and an ROE of 14%, reflecting a strong result in a mixed environment.","In Banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion is up 4% year-on-year. This quarter we continued to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.2% wallet share and widening the gap for number two. We ranked number one in fees in North America and EMEA and gained share improving to number two in Asia.","Another strong quarter for Advisory, up 17% year-on-year as activity levels remained high. We maintained our number two ranking and grew share by over 100 basis points from last quarter. Equity underwriting fees were down 5% from a strong prior year for IPOs in EMEA with lower wallet share as we gave back some of the outsized share gain we had in the third quarter.","This quarter we ranked number two globally with strong performance in the U.S on acquisition finance and follow on. Debt underwriting up 1% and we maintained our number one ranking with strength in high grades also on the back of the healthy M&A market.","Treasury services was down 2% year-on-year on lower net interest income and the lending item of $302 million was down 32% year-on-year primarily driven by losses on restructured securities.","Given the reporting changes we\u2019ve made going forward, we should expect that for treasury services revenues would be about $875 million plus or minus per quarter and lending approximately $350 million and that\u2019s given the trade finance transfer.","Moving on to markets, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 1% year-on-year, excluding business simplification and the gain in the prior year on the IPO of market which we previously disclosed, but with strong relative performance and rates and in equity markets.","Fixed-income revenue was $2.9 billion down 10% year-on-year similarly adjusted. In macro products, the quarter was dominated by EMEA with a bond sell off and economic and political uncertainty including Greece. This uncertainty slowed the momentum we saw in the first quarter and kept clients from the sidelines in currencies in emerging market, but drove strong performance in rates.","Credit and Securitized products were down on a continuation of general weakness in the market. And as I mentioned, equity market had another strong quarter, up 27% year-on-year on revenue of $1.6 billion with strong performance in all three regions relative to last year and outperformance in Asia, particularly China and Hong Kong on the back of client interests first to participate in the rally and later to hedge.","Looking forward, business simplification would drive a 9% decline year-on-year in third-quarter markets revenues with a corresponding decline in expenses. And as I look into the third quarter in analyst models, I see relative to our markets results this quarter you have revenues in markets going up sequentially. We\u2019re fully expecting to see normal seasonal declines in the third quarter markets revenues.","Security service revenues of $1 billion was in line with guidance, up seasonally on the European dividend season. And moving on to expense -- total expense was down 15% year-on-year at $5.1 billion and an overhead ratio of 59% and we successfully executed the expense reduction associated with business simplification and with lower legal expense. Compensation expense down 4% year-on-year comped a revenue ratio for the second quarter 30% flat year-on-year.","Moving on to the Commercial Bank. In commercial Banking the underlying businesses continue to perform well with strong loan growth, up $6 billion quarter-on-quarter and record end of period loan balances with good credit fundamentals and low non-performing loans.","We also saw continued momentum in IB revenue off of a record last quarter which was driven by a large transaction. However, we added $187 million to reserves in the quarter reflecting the select downgrades including oil and gas. Despite this, BAU credit performance at the portfolio as I said remained very strong. This drove net income of $525 million on revenue of $1.7 billion and an ROE of 14%.","Revenue was flat year-on-year driven by continued spread compression in loans and deposits, partially offset by growth in loans and flat sequentially despite the record investment banking performance in the first quarter.","Expenses were up 4% year-on-year on increased control related staffing and down slightly quarter-on-quarter. For the rest of the year for each quarter, we expect expenses to remain around $720 million.","Loan balances increased 12% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans grew 3% sequentially in line with the industry with middle market growth being somewhat challenged by strong competition, but with more strength in corporate client banking, driven by short-term financing activity and new facilities for our existing client base.","CRE loans grew 5% and continue to exceed the industry on strong activity in both commercial term lending, which had record originations in the quarter and in real estate banking.","Moving on to Page 11 and Asset Management, net income of $451 million on revenue of $3.2 billion, reflected solid growth up 6% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter. Driven by continued net long term inflows marking the 25th consecutive quarter at $13 billion with strength in North America and multi-asset flows, driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion up 4% year-on-year and client assets of $2.4 trillion.","In addition, we have record loan balances which were up 9% year-on-year. Expense of $2.4 billion was up 17% year-on-year, primarily driven by legal expense and to a lesser extent the impact of moving an asset to held-for-sale. Adjusting for those two items, expense would have been up more in line with revenue and margins in line with our targets. Lastly, we reported strong investment performance with 78% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. ","Turning to Page 12 and Corporate, Treasury & CIO reported a net loss of a little over $100 million, and other corporate reported net income of $552 million which included a benefit on discrete tax items I previously mentioned.","So on Page 13 is our outlook page, any guidance that I was going to gave I made through the presentation, the page is here for your reference. So to wrap up, strong reported and strong underlying results this quarter across our businesses and an environment that continue to remain somewhat challenging with double-digit core loan growth, with broad-based strength in our underlying drivers, and with continued execution and excellent progress against our capital, our balance sheet and expense commitments.","So with that, operator we will open up the line now for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Great. And your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Marianne Lake","Hi, Erika. Good morning.","Erika Najarian","My first question is the capital progress has clearly been solid this quarter. Last week, however, there seems to have been more support in the Fed in terms of including the SIFI surcharge in the CCAR test. And I guess the question is in two parts: one, what do you think the chances are of the -- any or all of the CCAR surcharge or the CET1 surcharge to be included in CCAR; and two, what are the next steps in terms of business model adjustments, if that did pass?","Marianne Lake","So to do -- obviously, we don't have any particular insights. I think the comments you are referring to comments about the support for evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of, and really that -- it hasn't changed relative to previous comments and the door has clearly been left open for that, but we have no further information and so far it's evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of the surcharge. So we are just going to have to, I suppose, wait and see. Meanwhile, as you know, we are -- and by the way, it happens for us, it happens for everyone and we\u2019ve shown you before not that -- good outcome, but we\u2019ve shown you before that we think that regardless the competitive peers set that we have is going to cluster at or around similar capital levels. And so if everybody have to increase their minimums, it's going to be a similar position for everyone. Meanwhile, we are continuing to execute on everything that we have already told you we are going to do to optimize our capital. And our commitment is to go to firmly within the 4.5% bucket for the surcharge and if we believe we can do it and it\u2019s economic and it\u2019s not going to hurt our clients, we may go further. So we will respond when we see the rules and we're not going to stop continuing to do the best we can to optimize our returns based on scarce resources.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just the second question is you\u2019ve clearly made also progress in terms of your deposit mix. As we potentially anticipate a rising rate environment for the back half of the year, given what the regulators have done in terms of saying, okay, here are the good deposits, here are the not so good deposits, how should we expect the pace and magnitude of retail deposit repricing or pass-through if the Fed does raise rates in the second half of this year?","Marianne Lake","So we actually haven\u2019t really changed our point of view since Investor Day and previously about the fact that we are expecting retail deposit and there are other people who have slightly different views, but we are expecting retail deposit to reprice higher and faster in this cycle than in previous rising rate cycles, given the competition so good high quality LTR compliant retail deposit, given the advancements in mobile banking, given the awareness in the general environment around low rates and the desire to participate in rising rates. So when we think about our sensitivity and our reprice, we model it in assumption that it\u2019s going to be higher -- somewhat higher.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Mike.","Jamie Dimon","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","I see your markets revenue are down 1% year-over-year the way you look at this, but I\u2019m trying to reconcile that with Jamie\u2019s comments two months ago at a New York conference where you said there is repricing in rates, derivatives, prime brokerage clearing and trade finance. I\u2019m guessing its just risk off. So can you shed more light on what type of repricing you\u2019re seeing with any specific examples, because the transparency for us on the outside is pretty weak?","Jamie Dimon","Yes. So obviously when you talk about trading, when you have two months to go in a quarter, you don\u2019t always -- you don't know the exact number. And repricing is a complex issue. I mean, I just give you some very specific things and I will tell you why it's hard to figure out exactly what shows up. Clearing, we definitely seeing people start to charge for clearing and effectively charge the balance sheet 25, 50 basis points. It is a small business. I don\u2019t think it's going to dramatically affect those lines. Prime broker, we have seen similar type of thing. Repo there seem that people are charging pretty much for repo, we need to get a return on it. Exotic derivatives, which are again very small of being repriced to, I would say, full capital and liquidity. Muni credit has probably been repriced a little bit against the small market. If you go to credit and trading, so credit we are really not seeing any repricing effectively in commercial credit. You\u2019re seeing a little bit mortgage to make up for the extra costs in mortgage. You\u2019ve seen a little bit in auto, got more aggressive not less aggressive, so trade finance you\u2019ve seen a little bit of repricing and I know these are not all trading numbers. What you don\u2019t see, Mike, is that in a lot of cases, when you may reprice a little bit, you\u2019re also sharing business so that you have -- so you are protecting your margins by because AML cost your -- you\u2019re not do certain types of business anymore. An FHA the lifetime cost of servicing, you cut back on FHA volumes etcetera. So you're protecting your margins, but you're actually shrinking your revenue in some cases. That's happening a little bit in clearing in prime broker and stuff like that. You want your best clients. In other categories, clients are like deposits we haven't seen repricing effectively. I don\u2019t think of non-operating deposits. On the other hand, some clients are saying lets restructure relationship to make more sense for you JPMorgan and I\u2019m willing to give you other business, which is not credit sensitive etcetera. So it's kind of a whole of the amount of things taking place in there, but the goal is to get a proper return to your capital not necessarily to show revenue growth in that line-item. It\u2019s very easy to show revenue growth.","Mike Mayo","And just one follow-up. When you think \u2026","Jamie Dimon","I think mostly what you see in trading is just volume related and spread related et cetera. And even in trading, spreads are narrow, but breadth is also very low, which means spreads get gap out pretty quickly which eventually could be good for trading. So it's unclear.","Mike Mayo","So when you say a little repricing, I mean, is it bigger than a breadbox? I mean, is this -- are we talking about basis points or 1% or 5%, what you're talking about here?","Jamie Dimon","I'm talking about basis points, 20 basis points, 15, 10. That's all we need is some of these things get a adequate return on capital as we currently look at capital.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Question on the deposit shrinkage. You obviously finished the program you announced at Investor Day. Just wondering if you're going to take it further what the impact on revenues has been and do you expect that the full benefit to NIM is already in 2Q or -- in the 2Q numbers we\u2019re going to see more benefit in 3Q from the actions you took?","Marianne Lake","So -- hi Betsy. So what I said and hopefully it was clear is that we actually exceeded our commitments, so we actually shrunk our non-operating deposit by more than $100 billion and not just grew our consumer deposit, but we are also able to grow also operating deposit. So we had a good mix shift both in consumer versus wholesale, but also within wholesale. And so we feel very great about that. There are two priorities off that. The first is protecting that position to making sure that we\u2019re able to not have inflows of those deposit size as the industry continues to absorb them. But the second is we will likely look to potentially push a little farther, but if we get harder and harder, each margin, the next $5 billion or $10 billion, as you get more and more closely aligned operating accounts in operating business and we have always said that we want to do this for the right reason for capital efficiency, but not do it in a way that its going to materially harm our clients. So that's the lens \u2026","Jamie Dimon","And the parts also we made in level 3 assets, derivate receivables, certain balance sheet items, RWA, so the efforts are optimized, the balance sheet for G-SIFI etcetera is not going to stop. That we\u2019re going to continue to do.","Marianne Lake","But its not -- I don\u2019t anticipate us launching another and announcing another program. We\u2019ve already done a little better. We will continue to try and do a little better. In terms of revenue impact, not very much right now as you might very well know, because you can see that the balance is much more on a spot basis than on an average basis, but the equation looking forward will be much the same as said at Investor Day, approximately 25 basis points revenue on approximately $100 billion average for half a year, but that would be some expense benefit on FDIC cost etcetera, so not a very big number. I think that was the question?","Betsy Graseck","Yes and the NIM benefit should flow into 3Q as well?","Marianne Lake","Little bit, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could remind us about the timing of your expense reduction targets in the Consumer and Investment Bank, specifically if you read the $57 billion in adjusted expenses for \u201915, how much of the ultimate cost saves does that $57 billion target for this year in Corporate? How much would you have achieved already in \u201915 and any thoughts on the trajectory for remaining saves after this year?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so let me do this in two parts and I'm going to start with the consumer businesses where the commitment is actually a couple of years old and we are sort of well low on our way to delivering against, the commitment $2 billion in \u201917 versus \u201914 and its not exactly linear, but you can consider it to flow through time and if you look at the CCB page on whatever page that is, I think we show that for the first half of the year our expenses are down over the first half of last year by $0.5 billion. So that gives you a sense where how we\u2019re tracking. On the CIB, obviously the commitment is somewhat newer at Investor Day this year 2.8 billion in \u201917 versus \u201914. I would characterize that in sort of two parts. $1.5 billion is business simplification. The majority of business simplification not all, but the majority will come out of our run rate in 2015 and we\u2019ve already seen that in the first and second quarter when you\u2019re seeing the $300 million, $400 million expense reductions in each of the quarters on business simplification. The other $1.3 billion which is all the reductions in technology and operations and headcount is going to be things. We are working on it actively. We have programs, we have people, but it's going to be more of a 2016 and \u201917 benefit. So if I have to look at the first half of \u201915 versus the first half of \u201914, take the 500 in consumer and business simplification in the CIB space, that\u2019s probably the right way to size it about a quarter so far this year.","John McDonald","A quarter of the total?","Marianne Lake","Yes.","John McDonald","Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up is on RWA. Any update to your year-end RWA targets and thoughts about how we should think about potential RWA levels longer-term?","Marianne Lake","So RWA, advance RWA is down $36 billion, $37 billion, 1536 we said a little greater than 1.5, we're still in track to be 1.5 or a little greater 1.5 advanced at the end of the year. Standardized right now is at 1.5, so pretty close to 1.5 trillion, again, the target at the end of the year 1.55. So that\u2019s a little better, but obviously on the standardized you have somewhat put pressure as we continue to grow those really great loans that we\u2019re growing. And so if you look to our Investor Day targets, we\u2019re still hoping to maintain the discipline around both of those at approximately 1.5 through time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. I\u2019m just curious in terms of your core loan growth. You mentioned that that\u2019s up about 12% year-over-year. Can you give us a sense as to where that\u2019s growing the strongest and where you are seeing a bit -- perhaps where you\u2019re seeing a bit more weakness within the core loan growth, specifically?","Marianne Lake","I would say -- yes, of course. I'll do it in three parts. First of all, it's growing pretty solidly or strongly, so either in-line or in some -- in many cases better than industry across most of the product categories. The one that\u2019s growing the most strongly because of the way we\u2019re portfolioing loans is mortgage. So that\u2019s driving some of that outperformance and the one that is most challenging, but still growing is middle market. Fiercely competitive, competitive everybody is chasing that sector. But you can go through the businesses, so we had 6% loan growth, 6% to 8% loan and lease growth in Auto, 6% Business Banking, 19% core in consumer, 4% in commercial, so 3% core in card. So it\u2019s solid to strong, pretty much across the board, most competitive in middle market and flattered by portfolio and mortgages.","Matt Burnell","Okay, Marianne. And for my follow-up I noticed I guess you were quoted in an earlier meeting today suggesting that there could be further provisions for the oil and gas portfolio. There has been some media reports prior to this week about regulators potentially looking a bit more carefully at your portfolio as well as a number of other banks. Can you give us a little more color as to how you\u2019re thinking about the potential trends there and any comment you might want to give in terms of where the regulators are focusing?","Marianne Lake","So what I said earlier is not inconsistent, it\u2019s entirely consistent with what we said last quarter. We built results modestly from oil and gas last quarter on the back of the spring redetermination of borrowing base. We built another modest reserve at this quarter, and we said we don\u2019t -- we might expect more reserves in the second half of the year, there\u2019s another redetermination cycle in the fall and its -- I\u2019m not going to say likely, but its possible we\u2019ll be selectively downgrading some time. If none of that is out of our expectations its completely sort of normal levels considering the cycle and how we think about the credit, we\u2019re still very happy. And we\u2019re not going to make any comments on regulators.","Jamie Dimon","Those reserves do not mean we\u2019re going to have losses?","Marianne Lake","Correct. So, we\u2019re reserving for downgrades, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re going to be catalysis.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks. Marianne, I just wanted to follow up on that last point. Your commentary about credit, so the second half is in line, you\u2019re $4 billion plus and you had a $1 billion of charge offs this quarter again. So, on that point just one question about, where you continue to see underlying improvements, Card obviously is still above your guidance. But can you give us some of the thoughts about where any existing improvement can come from?","Marianne Lake","So, I mean credit like charge offs have been very benign across the wholesale space. They\u2019ve reverted to somewhat more normal levels in auto. So I\u2019m not expecting that to be big step changes in the underlying charge offs in the wholesale space. We\u2019re continuing to see improvements at a slower pace in mortgage, but at 21 basis points we\u2019re sort of getting down there. And Card well, its slightly above at the 2.6% above our 2.5%, its also pretty much getting there. So, its one of the reasons why we said, expecting second half to look like the first half in terms of order of magnitude and expect net-net low for long.","Kenneth Usdin","And then to your point about not expecting to be much loss from the energy provisioning and that we could see energy provisioning, plus this quarter you had a nice $300 million release from the NCI portfolio. Is this kind of fit for reserve release, and can you talk about your outlook there?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say in the non-credit -- sorry, just to clarify the comment on oil and gas, we said they will not necessarily translate into losses and we\u2019re not going to predict which ones will or won't. On the reserves, for non-credit impaired portfolio, we are continuing to see improvements in charge-offs as well as home prices albeit a little bit more gradually. So, I would still expect there to be more reserve releases over the course of the next 18 months in hundreds of million of dollars in total, not billions any longer of course. We have $1.8 billion reserved right now. In the non-credit, in the purchase credit impaired space, clearly that life of loan model and so we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that model against parameters that we have and expectations. So that will be what it is at the time. And in Card we\u2019re not expecting any significant reserve actions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Hi. Good morning. Maybe we can just ask a question on card fees. That\u2019s been an area where growth in card fees have been pretty flat for a while as you ramp up reward spending. We saw a pretty nice jump quarter-over-quarter at some of that seasonal but it was a little stronger than what we saw the last couple of years. Are we getting to a point where you\u2019re lapping some of these higher reward costs in growth and new accounts, we should start to see that revenue line track more closely with spending or is this something unusual this quarter.","Marianne Lake","So you\u2019re obviously right, all the underlying phenomena are still there, we\u2019re still seeing spread compression, but we\u2019re seeing very strong growth in spend. We aren\u2019t quite loud yet on new accounts going through the revenue rate. We will eventually be, but it\u2019s a good thing to be adding these new accounts that would drive new strong spend in the future. So, I would say, our near-term guidance is that we\u2019re expecting our revenue rate to be at the lower end of that 12%, 12.5% range. And yes over time as spread compression abates and we continue to drive strong growth with the quality of our products and our partnerships, we would expect that to start too agile.","James Mitchell","Okay. And on the card loan side, it seemed like you saw a decent uptick this quarter. You\u2019re starting to get past some of the run off and seen more of a core driver?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I mean we told you we would hope to drive core loan growth in the card space, low single digits. In this quarter it was 3%.","Jamie Dimon","I just want to emphasis. Marianne mentioned it, but emphasis, Chase Paymentech which you\u2019re seeing really good growth probably 50% fast in the industry. But we\u2019re also signing people with Chase Paymentech combined with ChaseNet, we\u2019re running real volume across it, and we\u2019re signing up a lot of folks that act for ChasePay. So the strategy of ours is kind of coming to provision and we hope it will be a good driver, happy customers and good growth in the next 10 years.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak","Hi. Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Steven Chubak","So, first question on capital. I just want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about preferred issuance plans going forward, now that you have met the 150 basis point RWA target?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, obviously we don\u2019t give you lots of details on our issuance plans. You\u2019re right one of that, the drivers for us to issue in part not exclusively was its not -- as you know we were Tier 1 leverage constraint in CCAR, and so as a result of issuing this, we not only helped TLAP but we help our CCAR stress capacity and at we\u2019re about 164 RWA. So I mean, we\u2019re not going to talk about board issuance, but we made progress.","Steven Chubak","Okay. And just a follow-up regarding Marianne your comments about the trading outlook for at least in the near-term. Recognizing its still very early days in the quarter, since the very start we\u2019ve seen -- well obviously we\u2019ve experienced a number of global shocks and on the regulatory front we do had that, that Volcker implementation deadline which is looming. So taking all those factors into consideration, how should we be thinking about the near-term trading outlook?","Marianne Lake","So to start with Volcker, we aren\u2019t expecting Volcker to have an impact in the near-term trading outlook. We\u2019ve been talking very consistently over an extended period of time about the fact that we reshaped our business through time to be compliant in substance and in form with Volcker. And so while that was real, reshaping of the business the last 18 months has been to really focus on getting operationally ready around the reporting and the metrics, and it\u2019s been hard work and we are ready. So I don\u2019t expect it to have a direct impact on near-term trading. Clearly over time we need to continue to sort of evolve the feedback lead with regulators, but that will be entirely gradual. With respect to the trading, its too early for us to say anything specific about the second quarter -- sorry the third quarter except to say, we are -- all other things equal, we would expect to see normal seasonality from the market levels. Nothing has changed that fundamentally wouldn\u2019t have us expecting normal seasonality in the third quarter.","Jamie Dimon","I just want to point out that trading, if you look at it over a long period of time it\u2019s been -- we\u2019ve become very consistent. I think in 2014 we had no trading loss days and even this year going a hand full of trading loss days. And obviously some areas are up and some are down, but our shares are high. I think we\u2019re doing a great job servicing clients. We\u2019re adopting all the new roles, like 15% of interest rate swaps are on CES today and I think 95% of FX trading by transaction is electronic. You can do a lot of that on your mobile phone or iPad now. So, the business is actually doing fine. The returns on risk are very good. We need to report that, but kind of return on bar are very good. So it\u2019s become a much more stable business that clients need over time.","Marianne Lake","And just to add to that, I would say that we also talked about in the sort of period of transition towards more normal economy and rising rates. You might see some shops like this. We weathered both the EMEA bond sell off and China well and it just speaks about the strength of our risk management discipline, and we generally do pretty well in more difficult markets.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul Miller","Yes. Thank you very much. You guys had a very decent mortgage banking quarter in the second quarter with rates going up. We know that that the refis have started to come down but the purchase market has been stronger I think than people expected in the second quarter. What do you see going into the third and fourth quarter especially with the new regulations come out with the disclosures with [indiscernible]?","Marianne Lake","So with respect so we saw a stronger seasonal purchase market and we actually gained a little share in the purchase market in the quarter, and refi held up pretty well because of the pipeline is coming into the quarter, but we are expecting that to both seasonally in purchase and in refi to pull back down to normal levels in the third seasonally, and so no direct impact from the disclosure requirements.","Jamie Dimon","And part of the quarter, we get reserve take downs, we don\u2019t double count that, that may not be there next quarter.","Marianne Lake","Correct.","Paul Miller","Okay. And then could you talk a little bit about the tax -- or my follow-up question on the tax rate. Should we be modeling in 20% to 30% going forward, is that 25% just an outlier?","Marianne Lake","So, the way I think about it is our normal tax rate for the year is 30% or minus. Just given the way tax reserving is it\u2019s usually bias to being fairly conservative, and so as you know we have seen discreet tax gains periodically, some of them not insignificant resulting from completion of settlements and audits with tax authorities. So, not to say that you should necessarily model in directly 30%, but we don\u2019t predict or forecast the tax benefits.","Paul Miller","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","The equity trading has been very strong the last couple of quarters, both for you and for others assuming it continues the rest of this earning season. And as you step back and think about some of the drivers there, you mentioned some repricing, we\u2019ve obviously seen some deepening of some markets, increased volatility. Like can we think about there being potentially a long-term secular recovery in the equities trading or do you think its more just stocks are going up as global QE or too early to tell?","Marianne Lake","It\u2019s definitely the later, and I think it\u2019s perhaps a little too early to tell on the former.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then just separately, what type of mortgage loans are you adding. Are these jumbo? Are they fixed rate?","Jamie Dimon","Jumbo.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, over half a jumbo, the other half are conventional conforming CCAR.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Okay. And I guess are you choosing to add some mortgage loans instead of securities, because you\u2019ve got a smaller securities book than a lot of peers and it seems like there\u2019s capacity to add there.","Marianne Lake","So well we have a fairly large securities portfolio, and our decisions around that are in part driven by our overall interest rate risk positioning. But with effect to the mortgages it\u2019s fundamentally a best execution decision for us. We will portfolio alone where it makes economic sense to do it relative to distributing it other than jumbo where clearly they would always go on our balance sheet.","Jamie Dimon","And if you could put a jumbo on a higher ROE than a Fannie\/Freddie, you would do that.","Marianne Lake","Yes.","Jamie Dimon","And part of the invest proposed for liquidity and obviously because it\u2019s non-operating policy down portions of that will come down too.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. I just want to follow-up on the conversation in fixed income and I agree with you, it seems like you weathered the whole Greece and China is doing pretty well. The fill out on the lack of liquidity and the fixed income markets gets a lot of attention, you guys had the most market share, had the lowest standard deviation in the business as the liquidity provider, that\u2019s a good thing for you. But curious on how you\u2019re thinking about preparing for what seems to pretty serious issue, and how serious of an issue do you think it is that in terms of the potential disruption?","Marianne Lake","So I mean, we have -- there\u2019s been a lot of press and reports including recently on market liquidity and there are numbers of factors playing into it. Its true that liquidities in some cases has dried up quite quickly when there\u2019s been extreme volatility and its been on itself but the reality is that, we talked about the fact that that was likely to be a phenomenon and that happened more frequently as we transitioned to a more normal environment, and we are very disciplined about how we trade into our clients and generally we\u2019ve been able to weather them very well. I\u2019ve had generally community we haven\u2019t, I mean not that we know, but we haven\u2019t got any stories or clear stories around the EMEA bonds settled for other things this quarter. So I think it\u2019s definitely an issue one that we need to watch, one that has multiple recourses, and one that we\u2019re generally taking in our stride.","Jamie Dimon","And if I look at the big picture and we pointed out the financial system like in the United States banks are much more sound, trading books are more capital liquidity, the whole system is better off. So you can't look at one piece and say, what will that do? The second is that these -- obviously there\u2019s less liquidity in the market place and it\u2019s a whole bunch of factors. It\u2019s hard to tease out exactly which one. But trading books are more capital, more liquidity. I think people are little worried about potential Volcker Rule violations, they\u2019ve been a little more cautious. There are obviously structural changes in electronic trading HFT and each business is slightly different. So not every -- I would say everyone is expecting exactly the same. It\u2019s also true that system is pretty resilient to what happened with currencies, and that\u2019s a good sign. I think what we are going to be really cautious about is when markets aren\u2019t that good. So, JPMorgan is fine. We are not talking about whether or not JPMorgan is going to have a hard time with liquidity, we are not. The question I really would have is when markets are tough, will there be a feedback from this violent markets, will there be more volume or less volume. As someone was quoted other day saying their markets always pull back in when there are tough times, that is true. The question is, will it be harder and worse or will it feedback into the real economy. Its not will there be lack of liquidity. Like during the crisis, there were two market makers out there, and we were one of them, and so you need them a little bit. But it doesn\u2019t stop markets from gapping out. So, we\u2019re not saying, this is terrible but you just be very cautious about it, and we are always trying to be very cautious.","Glenn Schorr","Speaking of cautious, the last one I have is on living wills. I know we have a little bit of time before we hear anything. But if you look at the comments from the previous year what they want is you all to address. It seems like there was a massive amount of progress made. I\u2019m not sure what you can tell us, but give us your thoughts on progress made and then maybe timing on when we might hear the regulators thoughts?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I can tell you that obviously we took the feedback from the regulators as the industry did exactly as you would expect entirely seriously put loads of resources and efforts to bear in making as much progress as we thought was humanly possible over the course of the period and we feel that we made very, very significant -- I would agree with you, the industry but JPMorgan specifically made very, very significant progress in addressing the feedback between getting it and the July submission date. And obviously we feel like we have a credible plan that\u2019s not to say, that we won't continue and some of our plans and you saw it in some others disclosures, we\u2019re going to continue to work very hard at simplifying our legal entities structure over the next few years and interconnectedness and operational resiliency and all the things and reporting readiness, all the things that are going to make it even better. So, we think we made very, very significant progress. We think our plan is credible. We don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019ll get feedback probably in the fall.","Jamie Dimon","And we respond to every single thing regulators raise with the huge resources to meet their needs, and it will probably be iterative over time about whether it will make more demands this year et cetera and -- but I think this is 50 page public part that you can actually read and it shows you, that\u2019s 50 page summary of a -- I think a 200,000 page detailed report.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Marianne, you mentioned a couple of times about the competitiveness in the middle market lending space. Can you give us some color on what you\u2019re seeing whether it\u2019s underwriting standards and what kind of product type in the middle market that is most competitive?","Marianne Lake","I mean it\u2019s very broadly competitive and we compete obviously with state banks, regional banks and non-banks, and its not that we are loosing loans and deals and most often on price. It\u2019s normally on price of holds or non-banks taking whole deals or on structures. But its very, very competitive and everybody likes the sector for growth and everybody likes, so everybody is trying to make progress and we\u2019re being very, very disciplined and as a result of that slightly lower growth in the industry average. And you might not want us to always grow at the industry average; you want us to hold through to discipline.","Jamie Dimon","And remember if you look at the whole relationship side, I forgot the exact number, but if you look at middle market relationships, I think somewhat like half maybe even a little bit less of the revenues are from the lending.","Gerard Cassidy","You guys have made great progress with the penetration of the mobile banking app that you\u2019ve created as well as online banking and you can -- you showed us that your branch count is down over a 100 branches on a year-over-year basis. What do you see for the branches as you go forward? Is that trend line likely to continue as you continue with the increased penetration from the mobile app?","Marianne Lake","So the way I would characterize it is, we had a period of time following the Wampum merger where we were in new market and we didn\u2019t have the right distribution footprint where we were building. We said about a year and half ago that we felt like we had the right footprint as a matter of about 5600 and that now we\u2019re around perfecting that, which is about consolidating certain branches where it made sense building new ones where it made sense consolidating together where it made sense. So you would see, I think Gordon said approximately 150 net down in each of the next couple of years and that\u2019s probably still the right way to look at it, but its really perfecting that it worth moving branches to the areas we like, whether the high density of affluence. And then as you know really looking at the nature of branches as a footprint the way we\u2019re using them, the way we\u2019re staffing them importantly moving them to more advise and less transaction, more automation. So, definitely responses to the evolution in customer preferences and mobile and online is not only a fantastic customer experience evidenced in our experience that, but it\u2019s also a lower cost to serve. So we\u2019re also improving the profitability of the very highly transactional customers. So, I mean I think Gordon used the word omni-channel. It\u2019s, we have a place for everything in our fleet and branches are very important. And we\u2019re just going to be evolving them to continue to meet customer needs.","Jamie Dimon","And one add is that we are thinking about attacking a new city for the first time, like in a major way because we want to see how that works out.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski","Hi, I was just curious about the reduction of the non-operating deposits, and I would have expected that to come mainly out of the Corporate and Investment Bank and -- but when you look at the disclosures on your average asset level it\u2019s essentially been $850 billion plus\/minus each over the last five quarters. So, where is the shrink really happening or how do we see it?","Marianne Lake","In the non operating deposits within the wholesale deposits, the majority is the CIB, but not quite two thirds and then you\u2019ve got the Commercial Bank and you\u2019ve got a little bit in Asset Management. So it is the majority of the number, but there often sizable numbers particularly in the Commercial Bank, in the financial [indiscernible]. And then when you look at our overall balance sheet you see cash going down because of the deposits. You see securities going down but strong loan growth offsetting and then small reductions in trading and secured financing.","Chris Kotowski","But then I look at like total assets in the CIB, its $845 billion this quarter versus $846 billion last year. It just doesn\u2019t look like a whole bunch came out of there. It looks like it all came out of the \u2026","Marianne Lake","Are you doing year-over-year?","Jamie Dimon","You\u2019re starting the wrong time period.","Marianne Lake","Are you starting at the year end or year-over-year?","Chris Kotowski","Well if you go length quarter its 865 to 845, it just -- I\u2019m just curious it doesn\u2019t seem to mesh up to ...","Jamie Dimon","Well, we\u2019re getting more operating deposits too.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So we talked about the, the deposit reduction is overachieving in non-op and improving mix in operating. So, trust me and I\u2019m not looking at what you\u2019re looking at, so I do trust you but trust me that 68% of it is CIB.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. Now, where you see it in your public disclosures, its -- it all looks like its coming out of corporate and other which is down more than a 100 length quarter. So, I was just kind of curious how it all works because it didn\u2019t \u2026","Jamie Dimon","We\u2019ll clarify it off this line because we [indiscernible].","Chris Kotowski","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks. My questions have been addressed. Thank you.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, Eric.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Hi, good morning. Just following up on the markets discussion, curious whether or not you\u2019ve seen some of the drama around Greece impact the M&A discussions in Europe this quarter and maybe an update on the IB Bank backlog at this point?","Jamie Dimon","The M&A we don\u2019t Greece has expected the M&A dialogue very much, because it\u2019s been very active pretty much around the world. And mostly around the world it\u2019s also like European companies coming to America, American companies going to Europe et cetera and those conversations continue \u2026","Marianne Lake","I\u2019d say a lot to Europe.","Jamie Dimon","A lot to Europe. So Greece had no real effect in that. Greece is a very, very small percent of the Eurozone in total. So economically if not a driving factor for most of the companies they are. Psychologically maybe it\u2019s going to affect some people, but I don\u2019t see why a company that has its own ambitions is going to change them because of Greece.","Marianne Lake","And I\u2019ll just -- with affect to the backlog I would say, it\u2019s very good.","Jamie Dimon","We did see a tremendous amount of some of that, we\u2019ve almost never seen before of the EU American companies financing in euro, because it\u2019s cheaper to do that even if you swap back to dollars. So a lot of American companies go to Europe to do that.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for that. And then on security services I know that you all highlighted that it\u2019s up quarter-over-quarter on the seasonal strength for the dividend season, but it was down year-over-year. Can you help us reconcile the year-over-year decline?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I think if you go back to last quarter Brennan and take a look at the remarks in last quarter, we talked about the change in presentation of some expenses versus revenues for the ADR business, that drove a reduction but just a classification issue and then in addition we did loose a large client at the end of last year and that is having an impact. So, I think if you go back and look at the second quarter hopefully that will make it clear. And so the guidance when we did those, when we made that presentational change and obviously we talked about the client exit a few quarters ago the guidance well as given those we would expect the revenues to run between 950 seasonally and this is obviously a strong season and therefore its that through 950 to a billion seasonally and therefore its at the billion.","Jamie Dimon","Marianne gave you all very specific guidelines which you don\u2019t normally do on treasury services, investor services and expenses in the commercial bank because a lot of you have your models wrong. And Sarah finds it very frustrating that she can't get it corrected quarter after quarter. So we said here is the number that is actually our best guess. So please put in your third and fourth quarter models, and revenue mortgage revenue is another one which has been ongoing for us and what\u2019s the other one so we can just get on the table whatever it is.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy Bush","Good morning. Jamie, you made a comment about attacking new markets and that sort of tags on to what I was going to ask which is, whether there are any of the old WaMu markets where you\u2019ve not been able to expand as aggressively as you\u2019ve wanted to and you might be thinking about exiting. So, I\u2019m just wondering, can you just tell us how you feel about individual markets right now?","Jamie Dimon","So Nancy, it\u2019s really important. When we talk about these numbers by the way, RWA and branches, we are not making commitments to anybody. That\u2019s our best guess, knowing what we know it, but we reserved the right to change that on a moments notice whatever reason it makes sense for the company and the clients. And so branches, it is very important that you look at branches, city by city and do you have the right footprint. So if you remember the old AMP which never changed its locations and it never changed its sizes and it failed. So every, any retail business should always be adding in the new communities, subtracting in some, having the branches adjust the new reality was getting bigger against smaller in our cases, getting smaller. But we\u2019re not getting smaller, because we\u2019re guessing at this stuff. We are getting smaller because the less need for operations in branches now and people are doing far more on mobile phones like that. So we actually do it city by city. We don\u2019t set an overall guidelines that you have to do X, Y or Z, it\u2019s city by city. And so for the most part in the WaMu footprint I think Florida and California for the most part, city by city we went in and added what we thought we should have. WaMu, then we also added on top of that small business, private banking, some middle market, other business that WaMu wasn\u2019t even in, and those are -- was part of the expansion of those businesses too and so, when I said a new city, I\u2019m talking about what we\u2019ve never really done -- I was talking about the way back to BankOne and the stocks we did the merger with JPMorgan is going into a city De Novo, that we\u2019ve never been in. And there you\u2019ve got to look at how many branch you\u2019re going to open, how long its going to take and, so we do want to do one of those and that will be -- will have nothing to do with WaMu, because there are places that WaMu wasn\u2019t.","Nancy Bush","Okay. Another geographic question, I get that Greece is not that important to the Eurozone and events of the past couple of weeks seemed to have been a lot of theater frankly. But the events in China in the last couple of weeks have been somewhat worrisome. So, I mean, have your plans for China changed at all given what seems to be a retreat from open markets there?","Jamie Dimon","No. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a retreat from open markets there either. So remember, we\u2019ve always said about China, you\u2019ve got to look and plan for long run which we do in all businesses. So McKenzie has reports that shows that they\u2019re going to have 25% of some of the Fortune 1000 and that was 10 or 12 years, enormous growth in their company. Their company is growing overseas. Their company is doing more M&A. We did that one unique transaction where ChemChina bought Pirelli in Italy. And obviously when we have a unique network we can help the Chinese company and the Italian company at the same time. So we\u2019re building there for the long run. As a risk management tool we\u2019ve always said that the way we treat that is we will be prepared for very tough times. And I think it\u2019s a mistake not to grow because you\u2019re going to have tough times. I have never seen an economy didn\u2019t have tough times. So, if you went back to United States when JPMorgan was building JPMorgan back to 1850-1860, look every single time that you panic because America had a recession, there would be no JPMorgan. So we\u2019re not going to change. What we\u2019ve seen with the officials in China is that they\u2019re very responsive to changes and you could argue whether they should have got in that involved in the stock market and you can\u2019t manipulate stock markets and, but they\u2019re very responsive to lending to -- they have changed their reserve policies, their RMB policies, the QFII policies, the Hong Kong Shanghai Connect. Not everything they do is going to work, but they still seemed very committed to more and more market reform, more and more of taking SOE rationalization -- SOEs and taking them public, so some market discipline there, creating more of a consumer society and what we\u2019ve always said and I think they\u2019ve the wherewithal to meet their kind of short-term objectives of growth. But we expect that they will have bumps in the road. We expect that and we\u2019re going to look right through that and the fact that their -- and also the market went from $4 trillion value, so its $10 trillion economy. It went from $4 trillion market value to $10 trillion, now its back to $6 trillion. I think those are the numbers. And the American stock markets has done that roundtrip a couple of times itself. And so the American economy is $18 trillion. I think our stock market is 25. And so there will still be huge opportunities there. If they ever completely reverse what they\u2019re talking about doing, you will see it in far more significant ways than getting involved in this stock market.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Oh, hi. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. Marianne, earlier on you were talking about deposit betas and for a lot of very good reasons, expecting that deposit betas will be a little bit faster this time around. But could you round out the conversation as to how you\u2019re thinking about how your NIM is going to traject in a rising rate scenario? Because I got a few questions on whether the deposit betas being a little faster means that the NIM trajectory is likely to be different from last time rates rose for you guys.","Jamie Dimon","So Marianne, you showed a NIM thing that NIM will go back to 265 to 275. And remember when we say deposit beta, it is byproduct, by -- and it\u2019s got gamma. So the first 25 basis points, the second are a different 25 basis -- different in the third 25 basis points and it\u2019s a pretty intensive analysis trying to get it accurate. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do and it\u2019s all in that number that we present it and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed dramatically. As Marianne said, we\u2019re assuming that whatever happen in the last cycle, this one will be worse. In other words, you will gather less of the benefit from rates going up than we have in the past.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, because the last time rates rose your NIM didn\u2019t move up that much.","Jamie Dimon","Well, listen there is a unique.","Marianne Lake","Yes, its.","Jamie Dimon","There is a unique circumstance when you\u2019re at zero. I mean there are lot of things that happen when rates go to 25 basis points that there will be -- you will pass very little of that on and we also see that -- we will see that money market funds. We will see that in some forms of deposits etcetera. The Beta gets high; it gets much higher as rates go up. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say we\u2019re conservative not aggressive.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Steven Duong","Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard. Just two follow-ups. You had mentioned the credit downgrades; I believe you\u2019ve said oil and gas. Where there any other sectors and if there were just some figures on them?","Marianne Lake","Yes, the credit downgrades included oil and gas and we called it out just because in total oil and gas was $140 million of our total net 250 reserve build, but also I said that there was select names, it\u2019s like a dozen names. So not really like there is another sector, just its very discrete names.","Steven Duong","Okay, great. Thank you. And just a second follow-up, can you just give us your mortgage duration and how far you\u2019re willing to take it?","Jamie Dimon","No, no we are not going to give you that. We disclosed -- when you say mortgage ratio, obviously we build into all of our models mortgage duration and you guys can calculate that yourself by looking into disclosures in 10-K that show mortgages at 3%, 3.5%, 4% etcetera. And obviously we can change that at will with our investment portfolio and things like that. It\u2019s all in the NIM already. So obviously we have negative convexity in our portfolio.","Operator","And there are no further questions.","Marianne Lake","Thank you everyone.","Jamie Dimon","Wait. Before you all go, I just want to tell you one of these days I\u2019m not going to come in this call. I\u2019m not doing it because I want to avoid it, I don\u2019t like it. And obviously if anything is important or really bad, I\u2019m not going to ever try to avoid bad news here, because we like to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, the good, bad, and ugly. But Marianne has started to do such a good job that I\u2019ve become unnecessary to be in all of them and I can obviously go do other things. So don\u2019t be surprised if one of these days I don\u2019t show up, don\u2019t read anything into it. Thank you for being here.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call.

And welcome to the JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements which is at the back of the presentation.","Starting on Page 1, the Firm reported net income of $4.9 billion and EPS of $1.19 and the return on tangible common equity of 11% on $23.6 billion of revenue for the quarter. Included in our results with total legal expense of $1.1 billion or approximately $1 billion after tax, in large part an incremental amount for FX.","As we go through the presentation, I'll call out other notable items. For your reference, we've included the EPS impact of those here in the front page. In total, they contributed a net positive $0.12 to EPS. So adjusting for legal expenses as well as these items give net income of $5.5 billion and an EPS of $1.33 reflecting solid co performance. ","I am going to skip over Page 2 and I am going to go straight to the full year result on Page 3. The Firm reported record net income of nearly $23 billion and record EPS of $5.29 and return on tangible common equity of 13% on nearly $98 billion of revenue. Excluding legal expense which remains elevated, net income for the year were $24 billion and return on tangible common equity 14%. You can see on the page of the bottom that adjusted expense $58.4 billion in line with guidance, and down $150 million from the prior year despite the impact of incremental cost of control as well as continuing to invest in our businesses. ","A final couple of points for the year. Core loan growth was strong at 8% year-on-year and net capital distribution for the year was approximately $10 billion including record dividend of $6 billion. ","Turning to Page 4. The Firm's fully phased in as on CET1 ratio was 10.1% flat to last quarter. With earnings and portfolio run off offset by capital distribution and an increase in risk-weighted asset, were dominantly driven by high account party credit risk. In terms of 2015 outlook, we expect to add 50 basis points or more to this ratio. Similarly, the Firm's fully phased in standardized ratio not on the page also remained flat at 10.5%. The Firm's SLR was 5.6% and the bank's SLR improved to 5.9%. And given the recent FSB proposal which added our best estimate of TLAC at approximately 15% excluding Basel which will be refined as the rules are finalized.","Moving on to Page5. And we before we move into each of the businesses, this quarter we changed the presentation of preferred dividend in our lines of business and show the impact here on the page. For the company, preferred dividend was and continues to be below the line. However, we historically allocated the cost of preferred stock to the businesses as net interest expense or contra revenue. With the corresponding positive impact in corporate NI. In order to have a cleaner trends and better pay comparability, we are now presenting preferred dividend below the line at each of our LOBs, which is particularly important given recent increases in preferred issuance. You can see on the slide and the change in methodology has no impact on Firm wise financials, no on LOB returns on equity. But LOB revenue net income and overhead ratios improve, additionally the adjusted affects contra revenue ratio in the CIB. So from here throughout this presentation and also in the supplement, all numbers in all periods consistently reflect this change. ","Moving on the business performance. On Page 6, the Consumer & Community Bank. The combined business is generated $2.2 billion of net income for the quarter. And an ROE of 16% on nearly $11 billion of revenue. Excluding the impact of losses related to non core portfolio exits in card the ROE was 18%. Consumer & Community Banking continues to deliver strong underlying performance, maintaining our number one ranking in customer satisfaction among largest bank for the third year in a row by ACSI. And in addition, we continue to deepen relationship with our customers. Average deposits were up 8% year-on-year with both across regions and markets. Record plan investment assets were up 13%. Our active mobile customer base was up 22% and credit card sales volume was up 10% on strong new account originations. Across CCB, we outperformed our expense target for the year and have reduced headcount by 12,000 this year exceeding Investor Day guidance by roughly 4,000 and over the last three years headcount is down approximately 32,000 across the consumer businesses. ","Turning to Page 7, Consumer & Business Banking. For the fourth quarter CBB generated net income of $861 million up 8% year-on-year and an ROE of 31% on improved operating leverage. Net interest income was relatively flat year-on-year but down slightly quarter-on-quarter on low deposit margin. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect continue to put compression in CBB deposit margin driven by lower investment rate will drive a modest decline in NI quarter-over-quarter. Noninterest revenue continued to grow up 6% across investment, debit and other fees. With the addition of approximately 700,000 net new households. And expense was relatively flat with efficiencies self-funding fund investment. ","Finally, in business banking the momentum we have seen in recent quarters continued with loan origination for the quarter of $1.5 billion, up 18% year-on-year. Businesses remain relatively optimistic and banker performance continues to improve. ","Mortgage Banking on Page 8. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $338 million for the quarter and a 7% ROE. We reduced expenses for the year by $2.3 billion, outperforming our $2 billion target. Moving to the top of the page, production pretax income excluding repurchase was slightly positive for the quarter which was better than guidance on higher volumes and revenue margins. The origination market was more robust due to strong rate rally but we estimate it was down about 5% quarter-on-quarter seasonally. Against which our originations were $23 billion, up 8% quarter-on-quarter reflecting corresponding share gains in jumbo and conventional. So this quarter we increased volumes, we gained approximately 100 basis points of market share estimated and realized higher revenue margins. Expenses were flat quarter-on-quarter despite the increase in volumes and we continue to focus on controlling costs. ","On to servicing, net servicing related revenue of $624 million was down slightly quarter-on-quarter on low balances with servicing expense of $560 million also down slightly. On real estate portfolios, we continued to add high quality loan to our portfolio. We added another $10 billion this quarter, up from $7 billion last quarter. Recorded net charge-offs of $111 million and reserve releases of $100 million in the non credit impaired portfolio. Lastly, headcount was down over 7,500 for the year and approximately 22,000 over the last three years. ","Moving on to Page 9. Card, Merchant Services and Auto net income of $980 million, down 7% year-on-year with an ROE of 20%. If you exclude reserve releases, net income was up 2%. The strong momentum in our business continues with very strong spend as well as card balance growth of $3 billion in the year. Revenue of $4.5 billion was down 4% year-on-year, but up 1% adjusting for losses related to portfolio exit that went through the quarter's result. With an adjusted revenue rate for card shown on the page of 12.2% in line with our guidance. Strong loan and sales growth was offset by spread compression and higher acquisition cost as we continue to add more customers. In 2015, expect a revenue rate to remain at the low end of our target range of 12% to 12.5%. Expense was down 6% year-on-year predominantly driven by remediation cost included in the prior period. ","In Card, we led the industry for the 27th consecutive quarter gaining nearly 500 basis points of share during the same period. And this quarter, we saw sales growth of 10%, driven by enhanced client acquisition and reward strategies. In Merchant services volume was up 13% year-on-year driven by continued strong sales performance. And in auto, result continues to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales as well as stable used car value. This was a 13th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth with average balances up 5% year-on-year. And coming into this year, the pipeline is strong which reflects continued strength in the auto market. Finally, on credit, in card we continue to see improvements in early delinquency and we released $150 million of reserve this quarter. You can see the net charge-off rate adjusted for portfolio exit was down slight at 248 basis points. In 2015, expect the charge-off rate to decline modestly. For auto, credit losses were higher on balance growth and as a charge-off rate start to trend off from historical lows. ","Now moving on to Page 10. Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $972 million and an ROE of 5% on $7.4 billion of revenue for the quarter. Adjusting for legal expense, ROE would have been 11% for the quarter and 13% for the year. In banking, IB fees were $1.8 billion, up 8%. We continue to ranked number one in Global IBCs per Dealogic, number one in the U.S. and we moved up to number one in EMEA this year. Record debt underwriting was driven by M&A related financing, strong advisory fees for the quarter contributed to the full year increase, up 24%. And equity underwriting was down from a strong quarter last year, but in line with the overall decline in market issuance. We continue to procure on more deals than any other firm for both the quarter and the year. And the fee pipeline continues to be strong into 2015 with the favorable environment generally across most products. Treasury services revenue was up 3% and lending related revenue of $264 million was down $129 million year-on-year given mark-to-market gains in the prior year. Moving on to markets revenue of $3.6 billion, down 13% year-on-year, but as guided excluding business simplification, the core business was down 5%. Fixed income was $2.5 billion, down 14% excluding business simplification, driven primarily by lower result in credit related and securitized products and with rate markets remaining challenging. However, currencies in emerging market had a strong quarter with higher volatility leading to increased productivity and our remaining financial commodities business is doing well. In equities we saw strong performance for the quarter, up 25% year-on-year at $1.1 billion. Derivatives was very strong, one of the best fourth quarter in recent years largely driven by Asia as plan activity increased on central bank action. Cash was solid, driven primarily by EMEA on the back of a strong ECM result. With respect to markets revenue for the first quarter of 2015, business simplification will continue to drive a negative year-on-year variance. For the quarter approximately $500 million or 10% with the corresponding expense decline of approximately $300 million. Securities services revenues of $1.1 billion, was up 6% year-on-year including high NI on high average deposit. Asset under custody were $20.5 trillion, flat year-on-year with market appreciation largely offset by significant client exit. Credit adjustments and other shows a loss driven by net CVA losses as well as the inclusion of nonrecurring DVA\/FVA valuation adjustments totaling approximately $200 million. Moving on to expenses, total expenses up 14% year-on-year, compensation was down 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013 and down 4% for the year, with a comp to revenue ratio for the year of 30%. The increase is driven by non comp; none comp expense primarily by over $900 million of legal expense as well as higher control related expenses with those being partially offset by business simplification. ","Moving on to Commercial Banking on Page11. This quarter saw net income at $693 million with an ROE 19% on $1.8 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 4% sequentially and flat year-on-year excluding the one time proceed of approximately $100 million from a lending related workout that was included in the prior year. Continued deal compression in our lending but as well as the impact of business simplification, it is being offset by higher loan and deposit balances. Quarter-on-quarter, revenue increased on better fee revenue and was incredible story for investment banking this quarter with record gross revenue of $557 million, up 11% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. For the full year, Commercial Banking client generated $2 billion of investment banking revenue for the Firm, reaching our goal. Expense was in line with guidance, slightly higher year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter due to the ongoing investment in controls. In loan balances, we saw an increase of $4.7 billion, our best quarter of growth since 2011, driven by strong performance in our commercial real estate businesses as well as both in C&I portfolio this quarter. Our CRE have now grown for 15 consecutive quarters and for the quarter grew 4% ahead of the industry. C&I loans grew 3% this quarter in line with the industry and with pipelines remaining solid. Finally in terms of credit performance an exceptional year, another single digit net charge-off rate for the quarter at eight basis point and a slight net recovery position for the full year. ","Moving on to Page 12. A solid quarter in Asset Management with net income of $540 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. Last year included a mark-to-market gain of approximately $100 million. Adjusting for that revenue was up 4%, expense of $2.3 million was up 3% and net income up 5% on positive operating leverage. ","This quarter marks the 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term net inflow at $10 billion driving AUM of $1.7 trillion, up 9% year-on-year. And we achieved the number one ranking in 2014 for global net inflow in active long-term mutual fund. We continue to see strength in our multi asset and fixed income flows and although smaller equity inflows outpaced the industry. Banking had record loan balances up 11% year-on-year with growth coming from both U.S. and international market and record deposit up 6%. As reported client assets of $2.4 trillion were up 2% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, but excluding business simplification client assets would have been up 8% year-on-year. Lastly, for the full year, we will continue strong investment performance. This was a second consecutive year of long-term net inflows of over $80 billion. Driving a fifth year of record revenue and second year of record net income, with 23% ROE and 29% pretax margin. AUM loans and deposits were also record for the year. ","Turning to Page 13. Corporate & Private Equity. Private Equity reported $107 million of net income primarily driven by private equity gain of approximately $450 million, partially offset by a little over $200 million of related goodwill impairment. This past Friday we completed the spin off of one equity partner and the investment professionals have formed the new independent company OEP Capital Advisors. At the same time, we closed on the sale of a portion of our private equity portfolio through a group of private equity firm. OEP Capital Advisors will continue to manage both the investments we sold as well as the investments we've retained. And closing this transaction had no significant impacts to fourth quarter financials. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $205 million, but remember this is after the impact of the change in how we allocate preferred dividend. Firm NI was $11.3 billion flat quarter-on-quarter. And finally in other corporate, net income was $645 million, including in this result were tax related benefit of approximately $500 million, partially offset by contribution we made to our foundation of approximately $150 million and close to $100 million pretax of legal expense. ","So to wrap up 2014 was a record year for both net income and EPS, with the 13% return on tangible common equity despite elevated legal expenses and despite headwinds from capital market, mortgage and the low interest rate environment. We maintained excellent customer satisfaction result and we gained share in many of our businesses. Delivered on our commitment including business simplification, control and expense discipline and we also met our capital target for the year while returning $10 billion of net capital to shareholders.","So with that we will open to Q&A operator. You can open up the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. Hi, okay, so a couple of questions. One is on the GSIB proposal. Obviously, it looks like you are at the 450 over the 7% minimum. And I know we can't exactly see because we don't have all the rules around the short-term whole sale funding rule but I am wondering will you line up in that bucket if you are close to the low end of that range? Is there anything that you could do to move down a bucket? ","Marianne Lake ","So, Betsy, obviously two things. The first thing is that the most important time period when this is going to matter is when its in full and compliance and through the transition period in 2017 and 2018. So result in the 450 bucket as we understand is based on 2013 results that we had to work over the quarter next three years to make sure we are maximizing every basis point of GSIB and every dollar of capital to the fullest extent to deliver return. So rather say that to move down a bucket it is in general term is fairly significant thing to do. Just given the types of things are driving the overall score. But we are not complacent about it. We worked a near extreme granularity to make sure that from the very first basic point that we are certain we are maximizing the return opportunity for that within the context of the bucket we are in. So it would not be a trivial exercise to move down but we are focused on making sure that we are optimizing the resources that are our most binding constraint.","Betsy Graseck","Right. It is a bit of challenge because it is relative to global peer so how do you run the business, the follow on question is how you run the business when you have been used to trying a gain as much market share as you can but now gaining market share kind of works against you on this G-SIFI?","Marianne Lake ","I think it is probably worth mentioning that while we were in the -- or look like we might be in the highest bucket relative to our peers, there were peers that were in higher bucket and they are not constrained by GSIB but CCAR. So it is likely to be the case. We continue to believe it is likely to be the case that you're going to see the differential in required capital for a variety of reasons not being as wide as might be implied by the GSIB. And so the key question is whether we are delivering the right shareholder value and incremental capital which we clearly thing we are and can continue to do. And so it is -- we are trying to thread the needle as you say about making sure that we are as focused as we can on maximizing the use of that scarce resource but within the bucket that we end up being wherever that might be, that our key priorities to deliver the highest ROE and the shareholder value we can, particularly in the world where others maybe more constrained by balance sheet or leverage. So it is a fine dance and it's what we are working through. We'll obviously keep you updated as we continue to progress our plan. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay. I assume we'll hear more on Investor Day. ","Operator","And your next is from the line of John McDonald with Stanford Bernstein. ","John McDonald","Hi, Marianne. Just kind of following up on Betsy's questions. Your hope is to grow or I guess your expectation is to grow the common equity Tier 1 from the 10.1 today to -- did you say 50 basis points this year you hope to add to that? ","Marianne Lake ","Yes. 50 basis points or possibly more.","John McDonald","Okay. And I guess could you give us some sense of what the assumption embedded in there are in terms of RWA mitigation, I guess kind of street estimate and earnings and some expectations for capital return? And I guess is that pace enough to get what you see as the new GSIB buffers where it look to us you might have to be at 11.5, 12 or is just a timing question? And you have time to get to 11.5, 12. If you could walk through that would be helpful. Thanks.","Marianne Lake ","Okay. Let me start at the beginning which is -- if you look at our Basel III advanced RWA on the slide, it is just little over $1.6 trillion, when we were in Investor Day, last year we said that we expected to be able to provide reduction to that by the end of 2015 to get the number closer to $1.5 trillion on the back of near model related benefit and et cetera. It is still the case, so that's the direction we will move in whether we get exactly to $1.5 trillion or slightly over will depend on the timing of some of those benefits but that's direction where we are going. So call it from a little over $1.6 trillion to a little over $1.5 trillion and we will give you an update at Investor Day. With respect to the assumptions, at the end of the day we generate a lot of capital and if we need to comply more quickly than we intend to do then we can clearly pull those levers. But we have always over the last couple of years have the approach of wanting to have a reasonable sense of urgency but a measured pace to get in where we need to be over the course of a transition period as well as preserving the optionality to continue to increase dividend and do buybacks. That continues to be generally our philosophy. And if you take, I think I said this before and don't read anything into this with respect to capital asks or anything else but if you take analysts estimate for the next two three years and take a $1.5 trillion or even slightly higher RWA basis, you can continue to add 50 basis points of capital a year as well as have meaningful buyback and capital distribution capacity. And 50 basis points a year from a little over 10% over three or four years get see to the other side of 11.5. So that just an illustration of capacity we have not necessarily a sort of commitment in terms of glide path but that's the basis upon which we feel like we will be able to add 50 basis points this year which is on a fully phased and advanced basis which is we think an appropriate glide path.","Jamie Dimon ","And we haven't really started to manage GSIFI which we are going to do now. ","John McDonald","Okay. And just a follow up on that is on TLAC. You mentioned in some of the notes here that you might feel any potential short fall to the current TLAC with additional common equity tier 1 which I assume you mean as opposed to kind of debt issuance or preferred, just wondering why you think that would be the best approach since you might already being building set one for GSIB buffer.","Jamie Dimon ","John, she didn't say that. We are going to meet our common Tier 1 with the bucket we think is appropriate and we would fill the rest of TLAC with debt, supporting debt or preferred we need to.","Marianne Lake ","Yes. I think, John, it is something you are looking at that we confused you; I apologize for that -- for the purpose of clarity. We expect to grow into GSIB buffer which would be at two different TLAC with common equity and whatever they got maybe when the rules are finalized on TLAC somewhere between nothing and something more meaningful, that's likely to be in debt issuance. ","John McDonald","Okay, got it. That's what I thought. I was just looking at that footnote 10 on page 20 maybe we just we could take a look at that afterwards. ","Marianne Lake ","I apologize. We will take a look at that. ","Operator","Next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. ","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. Just wanted to talk about expenses and initially focusing on the litigation charge of $1 billion after tax. It is pretty clear as you said that the bulk of it goes to the investment bank and that it affects as you said but should this give us a sense that you now feel that it is reasonable that you have reasonable and probably basis to think in terms of what your settlement would be --say with the DOJ or are there other elements that drove the increment? ","Marianne Lake ","So, Guy, both the reserves that we take in the quarter represents our best estimate based upon facts and circumstances, as you know that must be the end of the quarter with respect to ongoing dialogue and investigations but they are not concluded so as much as we would like to, we can give you no assurances with respect to the final conclusion. And that's really what we can say about where we are on the FX matter. ","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. And then more broadly on expense, just given that we've seen another decline in net interest margin that we've got flattening yield curve environment and quite a bit of sluggishness elsewhere. And of course all the regulatory capital requirements that continue to build. Should we expect that revisit your $58 billion-ish expense target in someway to bring that meaningfully down?","Marianne Lake ","So just one quick thing on NIM before I talk about expense. Just --we kind of manage the NIM -- NIM can be reasonably volatile purely as a feature of the amount of cash that we have in our balance sheet. What you saw this quarter in terms of NIM which was five or six basis points decline whether you are looking at firm or core, is in very large part driven by incremental cash balances close to $50 billion. ","Guy Moszkowski","Which leave there for days. ","Marianne Lake ","Some of which there for days, some of which is an accretive from an NI perspective will be at modestly. So I think the more important measure for us anyway quarter-over-quarter is that our NI was flat. So and then just in terms of the flattening yield curve, we are more geared towards and so right to move and we still expecting that to happen in second half of the year. And so what really matter for us is Fed funds not withstanding the overall yield curve. With respect to expenses, yes, we will give you more updates at Investor Day. But I can continue to reiterate what we said in the past which is we would continue to expect to push our adjusted expense absolute dollars downwards over the course of the next several years. And in combination with hopefully an improving economy and better interest rate move towards the 55% plus or minus -- the 55% over head ratio over the medium term. So you would expect-- you should expect our adjusted expenses in 2015 to be down, but we continue to have albeit that we reach the peak in second half of the year, we continue to have elevated cost of control and some of that leverage will be more in 2016 and 2016 than in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo ","Hi, I'm following up on the expense question. If you look at slides 2 and 3, it looks like your adjusted efficiency ratio of 61% in the fourth quarter and 60% for the year got worse from 59% either the prior quarter or prior year. So it's gone the wrong direction and I thought you said that you had some peak in costs in midyear and I hear what you're saying about guidance at Investor Day and adjusted expenses in 2015 down, but can you give any more ins and outs on why you think the efficiency ratio on a core basis should improve?","Marianne Lake ","So a little bit it was driving efficiency ratio in second half versus the first half is seasonality in revenues and year-on-year revenues were down slightly. So obviously it is a little bit elevated relative to 59% to 60% ratio but obviously the absolute dollars on a downward trend. And hopefully what we are going to see in combination over the course of the next year or two is we will continue to look at efficiency in our controlled spend. As I say we are going to be looking at that in 2015 relative to the exit 2014 right. So you are going to see more of that leverage in 2016 and 2017. We will continue to bring mortgage cost down, cost within the branches down and but affecting against that hopefully we will have stronger performance in some of our businesses and show some expense growth. So overall trending down and but revenues are positive story and they were down year-on-year. ","Mike Mayo ","It's been three years kind of stalled progress with overall efficiency. I know you have some of your reasons with regulatory costs. You mentioned 2016 and 2017 benefits, but can investors see an improvement in efficiency expenses for revenues in 2015?","Marianne Lake ","Well, so, Mike, we will give you the low down at our Investor Day, you will see absolute reduction in dollars and we will give you the outlook for the efficiency ratio then. ","Operator","Next question comes from the line Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. You had some good loan growth in consumer and in particular credit card in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering how much of that is kind of normal seasonality versus maybe some strengthening underlying demand for the consumer.","Marianne Lake ","So I would say a bit of both actually, as obviously as you articulate, we do seasonality but we did reach an inflection point during the year where we started to see more -- a little bit more demand anyway to greater extension. But I'd say our outlook for credit card outstanding gross for 2015 is sort of modest low single digit growth not higher than that. So a little bit of both and but we are flatted by seasonality in terms of the fourth quarter.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, then just separately in terms of the sharp decline in energy in general and I guess oil specifically, how do we think about some of the puts and takes with your customer base? Obviously, this should be good for the consumer maybe mixed for corporates and institutional. There might be some risk to certain countries. Like how should we think about this holistically and how do you try and stay on top of this?","Marianne Lake ","So JPMorgan taking in three pieces. Yes, we think it's very good for the consumer on balance and also for the economy on balance despite strengthening dollar. So we think that the consumer spend, consumer even quite expenses likely to be positive as a result. From a trading perspective there are pluses and minuses. The oil price volatility contributed to the softer quarter in the credit space, but was hopeful as it related to the currency the commodity space so in fact net-net mutual to maybe even slightly favorable. And then with respect to our traditional credit exposure to the sector, it is about 5% of our overall credit exposure and well secured top of the capital structure where it is name by name analysis that we do. We feel comfortable with where we are right now. It is cyclical business and we are expecting downgrade but we are not facing any meaningful issues in the face right now. Overall, oil is a reasonable positive for the economy and consumer and so for JPMorgan from the financial perspective a modest issue, positive or negative. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. My primary question is there's clearly been a lot of ink spilled recently in conversations again about a potential breakup of JPMorgan, especially relative to the higher capital buffers that could come from the Fed. And I guess, Jamie, could you remind us of how you're thinking about the benefits of keeping the franchise consolidated for the shareholders versus some of the conversation that investors are having today about breaking up or shrinking the bank in order to step down on your capital buffers?","Jamie Dimon ","Yes. So first I dispute the fact that some investors, there are some people wrote about it as a possibility because of excess capital and that's true, you have to hold more capital, things be equal, it will reduce your returns. But even the people wrote about that, talk about these superior franchises, the benefits of synergies, the good the company brings to there. So the first way to look at a business first and foremost has been and always will be what do you for customers. Not what you do for yourself and your return et cetera. And on the customer franchise and every business were gaining shares, we have good returns, we've got good market shares. We've got good customer sat levels. The synergies are huge, both expense and revenue synergies et cetera and some not all disappear under the various schematics of a breakup or something like that. That's number one. And the question is now you are bearing after capital, how bad is that relative to that and for the most probably we will able to manage that. We've talked about products repricing and managing GSIB, managing CCAR, managing LCR, managing SLR and we are going to maintain the franchise, manage it-- we still think we get good returns. Now there is a point to which the capital drag would be so high that you may want to consider alternatives, but just remember they are not simple. Like anything you do, every company will have to have cash management, global tradability, every company general ledgers and HR things and data centers and nerve data centers inside the security and it just-- it isn't that simple process. But so far the company has earned good returns in all these businesses to wrap this crisis. And I am going back to 2010, 2011 and 2012 and that's a sign of stability. In fact, even Mike Mayo had a report which there is a slide that shows the volatility of returns. And we among the lowest with the better returns. So that is proving it. but the model works in the business standpoint, yes, we have to carry more capital and will manage that over time. ","Marianne Lake ","Erika, just add to that, we are still in a period of flux as it relates to in a broadly rule, not just capital rule and we are in a period that got to relate to the competitive environment. And it would be for us, it would premature to take these strategic decisions that we don't think would add shareholder value in what is a very sort of challenging influx and cyclical low for the environment. So we preserve optionality. We think we are generating significant shareholder value, significant synergies and any discount could arrive regardless. ","Jamie Dimon ","And remember the capital stuff is not an element is not -- what they are doing now is not a size of riskiness; this company has been a fortress company. It has delivered decline, so its diversification is the reason why you said less volatility of earnings, was able go through crisis and never loss money ever, not one quarter. And so in the real life crisis gets fine, any future crisis we are going to do fine. There is reason you have big global multi national banks. And they are so big global multi national including government. This company movies $6 trillion to $10 trillion a day, you are not going to do that as a small bank. And you are not going to syndicate out of $20 billion bridge loan and you can't do certain things globally in 20 countries if you are in 20 countries. So you got to figure out what model you have and does it make sense. And it's not necessary comparable to all other companies. So all model make sense to you, you have seen return in it.","Erika Najarian","Understood. And just a follow-up question to that, Marianne, if we look at the GSIB scoring process not the proposed Fed process and we think about the five pillars that drive the buffers, it seems like if we look at publicly available data that where JPMorgan really sticks out is under the complexity pillar. Is there any way to move that down without giving up significant meaningful revenue and is that the bucket of focus in terms of potentially managing buffers from here?","Marianne Lake ","So you are right the complexity bucket does stick out. Just for what it look, we are looking at each bucket and we are looking at a very granular level because obviously we need to look at the whole thing in combination. And the complexity bucket, Jamie said I think earlier, if he didn't I just repeat. OTC derivatives, there is now drives a large chunk of it. Clearly, we are going to do everything we can in terms of netting and housekeeping and everything to reduce stock meaningfully is to have a meaningful impact on our client flow business. Level three assets is second piece and obviously to the degree that those things are -- by definition they are less liquid and so a result -- ","Jamie Dimon ","Does that not make them bad? ","Marianne Lake ","That does not make them bad. They are just less liquid and as a result we obviously will take a look at whether or not there is opportunity to reduce that. But again it is also relative to market size. And then finally our AFS portfolio which to have in a complexity bucket is not intuitive to all of us and over time that may reduce but right now it is a very core part of how we think about structuring the interest rate, risk management of our balance sheet. So we are going to look at it but we are going to get very, very granular. And there is no silver bullet. ","Jamie Dimon ","I'd add so years we can drive it down without damaging the franchise. ","Marianne Lake ","Right. It is about looking at the first 10-20 basis points not the last three or four.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. Can we revisit the energy conversation for a sec? I mean in my experience when any asset class falls this much so quickly, it's usually pretty bad and I heard your comments and I completely agree that it's great for the consumer and net-net positive, but am I doing the math right? If it's 5% of your outstanding, is that on the $743 billion of loans?","Jamie Dimon ","That's commercial. ","Glenn Schorr","Commercial, okay. Because what I want to get at is you made a comment it's 5% of outstandings; a lot of it is secured. I'm sure you have some reserves against it. It's just -- it seems like an odd thing. I know it's early and we'll see if it stays down here, but it seems like a big deal and yet it doesn't seem like a big deal to you guys. So I just want to make sure that we talk about what your exact exposures are and why you feel better than most people I talk to.","Marianne Lake ","So our exposures are about $46 billion, about 5%, there are just no credit portfolio and about two -- 70% of its investment grade about, two third is in the sort of CIB, so these are large well capitalized company. And the others are in the commercial bank, name by name we understand that what looks like these are asset based loans, top of the capital structure, names we know and we are going to see downgrades and we are not suggesting that there isn't going to be some stress and we don't where oil may bottom. But, yes, we do have reserves. We have reserves based upon a long history of day that include cycles; it seems cycles before like this. And so we will take downgrade maybe --we may need to take more reserve but it doesn't feel like it say very significant issue or imminent series of charge -off rates now.","Jamie Dimon ","For us there will be companies that are more invested in oil that may have different issues. And then there is a secondary effect which obviously you all can predict like Russia, Venezuela. So, Russia, we have exposure. Venezuela virtually none and other countries. And there is another secondary effect. If you are talking about commercial or even consumer real estate, Dallas, Denver, Houston. As you saw in 1986, 1989 and those all slight negative. But not again -- for us they are not mutual, very well diversified. And for us who have the other side. General consumer credit will be better not worse. And you can argue and I don't spend too much time on it. But that even retail will be better. There are whole bunch other beneficiaries of this change of credit. So some will be worse and some will be better, so for net-net for us it's just not that big deal. It is a perfect legitimate thing we all be concerned about for companies which are very concentrated in oil or even commercial real estate companies concentrated in oil areas. So that's not something that we need to worry about. ","Marianne Lake ","So we are watching it closely and to Jamie's point, we are paying attention to our real estate portfolios in those geographies so that's going to be overall sector on geographical differences and how to this plays out and we are paying attention to that. ","Jamie Dimon ","It is a good example of diversity helps, yes. ","Glenn Schorr","Yes. I appreciate that. The only related follow-up I have is I don't know if the same thing is happening in oil. I know in and around October 15 when we had wild swings in the 10-year, people talked about less liquidity at the banks being a partial contributor. I'm curious to see if you think there's something to do with that on the oil side too because everybody's been downsizing commodities. And then the bigger question is does anybody care about it, are the regulators watching and paying attention and do you think some of this is contributing to the bigger volatile swings we're seeing?","Marianne Lake ","On the first point, I think there is probably some true to the less liquidity but it is more about over supply and lack of global growth simulating demand than it is I think a liquidity story from a capital market perspective. Sorry, Jamie, you are going to -- ","Jamie Dimon ","I would just add that when you are look at -- I am surprised that people so surprised when commodity moves like this. Commodities move like this my whole life. And obviously the supply and demand imbalance and Marianne mentioned that United States supply has gone up by 5 million barrels a day for the last five or six years. People are little surprised that the production that was positive about Libyan, Iran and Iraq and some other places, a lot of people need oil revenues but the other things that surprise people with slightly increased demand, not I say slightly China and some other places and the other one that surprised people is OPEC. Instead of OPEC making some kind of move to reduce supply they didn't. But to me oil commodities have kind of evolve to, oil is at even more evolve to so in the oil business you got to prepare for something like that. That is the way it is going to be. And that's the way for to us like. And yes speculation, inventory and all these things may affect in the short run. Remember, there is a focal point at which oil, the margin with dollar can be produced and I think our economies says that's $75 oil deep drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and around the world. And one data recover that because the world still will use more oil and need more oil et cetera and in the meantime you got to manage around the volatility and I don't think any of that had to do with trading. Not a -- but had to do with fundamental supply demand and balances and people getting prepared for it and taking views and not us, I am talking about oil companies and you read about countries who hedged it and countries who didn't and companies who hedged, companies who didn't and I think it is a legitimate concern about liquidity in markets that when we have volatile markets or violent markets, how much liquidity will remain but I think you there you are talking more about-- which you saw a little bit in treasuries but it is about credit. And it's possible. We just don't really know. So we are little worried about it. But we will there hopefully making healthy mortgage for our clients when the times come. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. ","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Marianne, I just wanted to follow up on some of the regulatory discussion that we've had. You mentioned back in December that you felt that even though at the 11.5% buffer there may not be as big a difference in terms of capital requirements between you and some of your US peers as the initial numbers may initially indicate. It sounded like that may have been a focus on the short-term wholesale funding buffer, which obviously hasn't been released. You mentioned in December you felt that that would be around 50 basis points in terms of at least a starting point for you all. Is it your sense that there could be calibrations above and below your level of 50 basis points or do you think at this point it could be a blanket number across all of the big banks?","Marianne Lake ","No. Look obviously we need to get clear on what the final rules and calculation that's like; I don't see it being blanket number. I think it is pretty evidence that it intended to be least measured relative to the size, if the one measure that's not measured relative to a market share but relative to the size of your operation and so consequently depending upon how the math works out, it could be differentiation for other people. But my comment were not necessarily driven by whether or not somebody else going to be more punitive, will penalize by short-term wholesale funding but by the fact that GSIB hasn't been and it is unlikely to be the binding constraint for some our competitors. For some of those it CCAR stress, for some it is leverage on CCAR stress and as a result they already are running at or above the level that maybe implied and that may continue to increase. So here we have a situation where the transition period the glide path is a four year period where it temporary run looking to put a glide path together that measures all of our objective over the next few years where others are after approaching 11%. So we will see obviously had phased out in the medium term or in short term I should say, certainly in the short term we have a reasonably level playing field. And the competitive landscape is changing and we are working very hard to make sure we are maximizing a return on every dollar we had. ","Jamie Dimon ","And the reason it went for 2.5 to 4 wasn't because a short term also funding because it doubled, it basically doubled the number on a new methodology. And so and I think when you spoke at 50 base point above you also made a short term wholesale funding buffer, you terminate buffer over required number to handle volatility.","Marianne Lake ","Yes. So the buffer yes totally volatility driven, the 50 basis point is the best estimate of what the short term wholesale contribute to the -- ","Jamie Dimon ","Added to it, yes. That is GSIB requirement also.","Marianne Lake ","We will say, my view it is not a blanket though you could see some people differentiated in that sense. ","Matt Burnell","Fair enough. And then, Marianne, just for a follow-up, in terms of your outlook for GDP, I think in December you also mentioned that you expected around 3% GDP growth is kind of your operating assumption. A little stronger in the second half than the first half. Given your comments on when you think rates are going up, it doesn't sound like that has changed very much, but given your conversations about oil and some of the other growth numbers that have come out, has that changed very much?","Marianne Lake ","So I mean obviously if you get sort of granular -- ","Jamie Dimon ","We moved into 3.1%","Marianne Lake ","Obviously if you get granular to different specific and countries you have a different answer but as a general matter, no, as a general matter for U.S. 2015 over 2014 according to 2.5% and globally closer to 3%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Jamie, you were very clear on the success of the global franchise that you guys have built and the success that you've been having with it. Is there any evidence that you're seeing some pricing increases or you can generate some pricing increases because of this franchise? And if not yet, what do you think it's going to take where you'll be able to really get some better pricing because of the value of the franchise that you present to your customers?","Jamie Dimon ","Yes, so it's a tough question to answer. We've seen some pricing changes in trade finance a little bit in prime broker not really in credit but I do think that you are going to see some in credit. So over time but that's not because of JPMorgan. That's just because the market is going to reprice some of these things it is more expensive to do. And we do expect that will happen somewhere over time. And remember the other thing which is really important, we manage this by client. So you can actually do a better job in LCRG, SIFI, CCAR by client and not change pricing just change mix. And so we are working 100 different ways to figure how to get good returns to shareholders while doing a good job for clients. Remember, we have more opportunities to do that. So whenever we talked to a client they don't want some of our balance sheet capability but they -- and they maybe willing to do other business with you to make sure they get it, even the pricing doesn't change and it might be good for us. ","Gerard Cassidy","And then as a follow-up, in the Corporate & Investment Bank, the world now has been operating under the Volcker rules since July of 2014. Can you share with us is there any secular trends that you're seeing because of that? And I noticed that your compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was a real low 27% versus 35% a year ago. Is that reflective of the changes because of the Volcker rule?","Jamie Dimon ","I mean it just a Volcker rule, so we have accommodated Volcker rule which we have to do in private equity and investment and hedge funds and Marianne mentioned that we closed the sale of couple of billion at private equity stuff. And even the CLO issue is a very temporary thing. The only question the CLO is should people be forced to sell greater than the -- they are all going to run off in three to seven years. So not a question of bank -- and that is not a material issue to us, we are going to accommodate that. The other thing that's important of Volcker is now the remaining one. How it affects market making and obviously they are the clients are going to be concerned. Do you have a good market making? There are always rules around. It would accommodate those reporting, your client demand, aged inventory, different ways of reporting volatility in trading, and now you have capital liquidity, all the trading is try to get make it safer but also so people can markets and we hope at the end day that will happen. If there needs to be adjustments because new clients are going to say, this isn't working for us. The other thing I'll mention about liquidity, spreads are kind of the same in credit. But the size you can trade is much smaller which to me it is early indicator if something goes wrong, you are going to have gap that spreads quicker and wider than it might have before. So but at the end of the day we hoped to be able to be a good market maker, earned returns for shareholders and obviously we got-- we have to playing out probably Volcker and all the other regulations stored in them.","Marianne Lake ","I think the thing to -- think about when you look at the come to revenue ratio just for the purpose of clarity if you look at the fourth quarter of last year excluding DVA and FVA, it was above 20 % to 26%, closer to in line year-over-year and that's evidence when you look at the full year ratio of last year 31% to 30%. So they are with the low end of our range of 30% but within the range relative to the performance and there was a big negative impact in the CPI on a revenue basis last year with DVA \/FVA.","Jamie Dimon ","And I just say that we always allocated capital to investment bank. And we've had HBA adjusted returns and stuff like that. So as you allocate more capital all things being equal that number comes down a little bit. As you kind of disciplined and try to do that properly. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura. ","Steve Chubak","Hi, good morning. So first question I have is on actually the debt capital markets business. Clearly, the results were quite impressive in the quarter. Certainly better than what the public proxy suggested and I was hoping you could give some additional color as to what drove this strength and then maybe how that informs your outlook in 2015 given that, on the last earnings call, Marianne, you noted that there could be some pressure on that business certainly going into next year or now this coming year?","Marianne Lake ","Well, I mean I think if you look at the 2015 dynamics there is going to be three principal things, 2014 was a year of larger deals, and 2015 is still got a good pipeline. So we are expecting to have reasonably strong -- at least start the year and probably strong year. And it is very driven in the fourth quarter and likely to continue to be so by sort of M&A related financing and so the downside we talked about is just less sort of maturities to be refinanced but nevertheless some. But we are going to continue to have support from the M&A side with respect to be fairly strong in 2015. So you got some puts and takes for what we think is going to be a solid to good year in 2015 maybe not, and maybe not a record but certainly a good year.","Jamie Dimon ","And so JPMorgan maintained a number one share in Global Investment grade, number one share in Global high yield, number one share in loans indication and which we hoped to maintain next year too. And those are very powerful positions to have.","Steve Chubak","Certainly. And switching gears for a moment just back to the capital discussion, I just wanted to get a better understanding as to what drove the RWA inflation in the coming quarter. It sounded as though it was really primarily a function of counterparty credit risk inflation. I just wanted to get a better sense as to whether that was driven by some of the pressures on the corporates in the oil and energy space and also whether your $1.5 trillion target that you reaffirmed, whether that does contemplate the potential risk for further inflation in the coming quarters if those pressures continue.","Marianne Lake ","So just I mean certainly well I think to put into context I think that the RWA growth was $12 billion so nevertheless a growth but not a huge number up. A chunk of is with regular way CVA which just in part has got to do with just no more market dynamics right now and spreads wider and volatility higher but a chunk of it is unrelated to that. And as we look forward to the end of next year at $1.5 trillion, well just to be clear I think I said $1.5 trillion or maybe slightly higher but nevertheless in a lot of big numbers the same trajectory, it more at risk from just the timing of our ability to execute on granular segmented model, model approval and internally with regulators than necessarily any sort of market dynamic not withstanding that will factor in. So I would say the bigger risk to achieving that unless sort of market pricing impact from CVA but more so ability for us to get the right timing of that model benefit.","Jamie Dimon ","Then I think like two thirds of model and one thirds is run off stuff, we know that's going to happen. And other thing as Marianne mentioned the advanced we are at 10.1% just generalize with 10.5% and yes the advance will change, spreads gap out, advance will go up but standardized won't. So eventually we think standardized can become the binding constraint not advanced. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning. My question was on the Consumer & Community Banking business. There are a couple of moving pieces this quarter with the sale of the card results, but also underneath that it looked like a couple of the fee-related areas might have been a little soft. I was just wondering if you can try to disaggregate that for us and was there anything that was also more of a one-time in nature or seasonal about those businesses this quarter.","Marianne Lake ","So obviously we talked about the cards portfolio that's driving some revenue decline also some elevated credit charge-offs. We have been experience and I think we guided to the low end of our 12.5% revenue rate change and we guided to that last quarter, the quarter before at a 12.2% in that range and what we are experiencing is spread compression is largely offsetting the strong interchange and other fee growth from the product volume, but when you acquire new customers and you pay the premium to acquire new customers that gets amortized to your results in the first year. So in years when you are net acquiring new customers, you will have a small net drag on your fees and on your revenue rate resulting from amortizing those premiums for the benefit of those strong relationships and the increased outstanding and spend sales volumes you get in future years. So we have been on a journey for the last two years and we continue to be on it way, there is some impact associated from the fact that we are now acquiring new customers each of which we believe returns hurdle for us or more than hurdle for us is accreted over a period. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. So it's a today versus tomorrow thing. And then on a follow-up, coming back to the energy discussion, you mentioned that it would be net to the consumer business and I just wanted to ask you to flesh that out for us. As you think about the benefits that you'd expect to get from the decline in oil prices, is it growth, is it spend, is it credit? How would you disaggregate that and give us an understanding of either magnitude or just time to see that benefit?","Jamie Dimon ","I wouldn't spend too much time trying to build this into your models if I were you, but it is quite clear that when you add $800 a year to the consumer cash flow statement that they consumers on average spend most of that. And I think you are seeing it in spend. And you are seeing in car sales, and you are seeing in retail spend, you've seen it -- and it is also quite clear it helps consumers. It helps their credit. I mean broadly. I mean we are not going out and saying that we are going to reduce credit cost and auto card and a bunch of stuff by kind of 15 basis points. I mean just you know it is going to be there. Just like you know was there when they are in the flipside. People spent a lot of time talking about how much gas price is hurting consumers and why shares down at Walmart, Family Dollar store et cetera. This is just the flipside of that. ","Marianne Lake ","And if you just look at the consumer spending specific, if you look at four quarter analyzed up 4.7% is the best consumer spend basis in 2003. So it is already taking effect in consumer spend and the disposable income as you say we are already expecting a new cost sales to grow next year but all of this is going to support the continued strong that we see in consumer. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research Group.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning. Just want to follow up on the card fee income discussion. If you looked at your new accounts opened year-over-year, you were flat. You're starting to seem -- you seem like you're starting to lap that higher amortization of acquisition costs. So is it fair to assume that we are at least getting closer to an inflection point where we're going to see fee incomes more track more closely with growth in spend or is there something else going on there?","Marianne Lake ","So you are right we are close to where -- we are close to lapping the acquisition cost dynamic not discloses but in the near future. But what you are going to continue to see is that we have a portfolio that in one off and as those lows run off they were loans that were high up and high rate loans than the ones we are originating right now. And as a result you are going to continue to see some spread compression in 2015 again against which you are going to see strong interchange. So I would say, yes, ultimately and in the fullness of time you are going to start to see the interchange growth outpace the spread compression but for a period of time there going to be somewhat of wash. ","Jim Mitchell","Right, but I was just speaking specifically to the fee income where you were down I think 7% year-over-year. I would think that would start to turn positive at some point.","Marianne Lake ","Yes. ","Jim Mitchell","Okay, fair enough. And maybe just one quick question on the expense side. You talked about the simplification impact on revenues and expenses. You're still at sort of a net negative about $200 million pretaxes. Should that get closer to zero? Is it just it takes a little longer to get the expenses out versus the revenues or is that going to be a permanent drag?","Marianne Lake ","So there is a -- overall the rate of income asset is not ultimately going to be necessarily zero, but when you think about in the context of the capital and the relative returns, it was not accretive our returns. And so we have the differential between 500 and 300 for the full year, it is still not zero. There is a slight lack. Clearly the slight lack taking out the expenses and but this is overall small net income impact but for overall mutual to positive benefit on the return.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, got you, thanks. ","Marianne Lake ","And regard these all that, remember, that our rationale for business simplification included a bunch of different reasons included activities that were core to our core clients' activities that were outsized in terms of operational and other risks as well as those that were returning hurdles. So there are other reasons to simply your business and they will have other ancillary benefit.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. A quick question on derivatives and equities. You guys highlighted the strength there. Were there any one-timers in those results because it certainly seemed like 4Q was volatile. Also did the uptick in equities VAR have anything to do with the revenue trends there?","Marianne Lake ","So no specific one time items in the derivative and equities derivate performance. And the uptick VAR has to do generally speaking with high levels of volatility that it does with anything in terms of risk direction. ","Jamie Dimon ","Equity derivatives largely Japan and Europe and Asia, they increase -- ","Marianne Lake ","South Asia, yes. ","Brennan Hawken","And that's true across -- ","Jamie Dimon ","That's the actual volatile -- is an example of volatility did actually help. ","Marianne Lake ","If you look at equities in total and particularly in the prime space, there was a small one time item but not in the derivative space. ","Brennan Hawken","Got it. And that change in VAR due to volatility was sort of across the board in the buckets, not just in the equities VAR?","Marianne Lake ","It is not a significant increase in VAR but yes we had -- you see increase in CPG VAR, on spread widening and volatility increase in equities, I mean just year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter we have seen an increase in volatility.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then sticking with capital markets, thinking about how we're starting the current quarter, it does feel a lot like deja vu here in the beginning of the fourth quarter where the markets are beginning with some pretty unconstructive volatility. I know we're very, very early going, but is that a fair comparison to make and are we starting off on a pretty tough foot here? Obviously there's a lot of road to hoe here, but any comments on that would be helpful.","Marianne Lake ","I mean this quarter more than any quarter, it is like really honestly too early to make any comments of any note regarding trading performance particularly given that the holiday sale mid week, so reality the situation is dramatically nothing has changed from the end of the fourth quarter, but there is no big new news in the first few days of trading.","Brennan Hawken","Great. Last small cleanup one on capital markets. I know you've mentioned that there's going to be a lag from business simplification, but was any of the declines in comp in CIB tied to business simplification here? Just trying to think about how much of that drop might have been due to some other items aside from -- ","Jamie Dimon ","It got year on clean up; it had nothing to do with business simplification.","Brennan Hawken","Perfect, thanks. ","Marianne Lake ","And I think if you look at our revenues excluding SVA\/DVA year-over-year that's on reasonably line with comp.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. ","Paul Miller","Yes, thank you very much. On the mortgage banking side, you're definitely picking up market share from probably your -- you were shedding market share up until probably the second quarter of this year and one of the chatters out there is that you've gotten more aggressive in the correspondent markets and the comment you made, Jamie, back in I think June of this year was that you wanted to get out on -- maybe not get out of, but lessen your exposure to those low FICO, high LTVs, i.e. FHA loans. I was wondering if you are still trying to lower your market share in FHA loans. Can you make some comments about being more aggressive on the correspondent side too?","Jamie Dimon ","I think they are two different issues. One is the correspondent business, properly done is fine and obviously we do look at their credit underlying because we had a back up over that 5 to 10 years correspond single loan over business and if we did a bad job we had pay for that. So you have to be more careful and do business with a proper kind of people. We have reduced our share of FHA loan just because the ongoing two reasons. One is the ongoing liability in the production side where the insurance was worthless over time. And the second is the just to cost to servicing FHA loans when they are going default and they have a much higher chance of going to default than not. So those are two reasons to do less. And that maybe I'll change over time but we are still in the same place in that. ","Marianne Lake ","And just on the share gains, they are in jumbo and commercial conforming loans not in the government space. So, yes, we are -- we are competing aggressively on price but with the right capital allocation with the right hurdle. And these are loans that are very high quality that we are willing to put on our balance sheet done with correspondence that we have confidence in the financial status off. ","Paul Miller","And then some of the rule -- on a follow-up -- some of the rule changes you're seeing coming out of GSEs that try to spur I guess loan demand is you're seeing the GSEs starting to do 3% down payment loans. Is that something that JPMorgan would go down underwritten correctly or is that just too risky?","Marianne Lake ","So I mean the GSE, you could always get loan up to 97% in the government space because in the agency space with mortgage insurance we've seen some movement from the FHA on GSEs and mortgage insurance payment. All of which I think is intended to try and help credit availability which we would generally support. It doesn't change our strategy, however, which is that we are much more focused on originating in the very high quality jumbo and conventional conforming space. But, yes, probably underwritten we will do agency loans in the programs that they have available. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Marianne, you talked about some of the loan growth that you've experienced and expect to continue to experience and also the driver of the RWA reductions. But can you just help us understand what we should expect from your GAAP balance sheet given that a portion of the RWA reduction sounds like it is coming from runoff?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, I mean look we have over the last I think two years and a quarter two plus years or so, we've seen an inflow of cash of between $300 billion and $400 billion on our balance sheet. And so our balance sheet size has grown slightly over the course of the last several quarters in the last year. But the vast majority of the growth is driven by incremental cash and there are two principal reasons for that. One is as we have been looking to become compliant with our and with U.S. rules on liquidity which we are compliant with -- and this was happened for a while, but the other is also that we've been receiving increased non operational cash flow and whole supply and so to the degree that cash is accretive from NI perspective and that we on balance sheet or leverage constraint and it is a key part of relationship with that client. That may not be a bad thing. And but to the degree that it is not a key part of the relationship that we are going to be disciplined about trying to manage that balance. So I would say underlying that we would expect our balance sheet to not be growing and certainly not significantly but cash can be the volatile factor. ","Eric Wasserstrom","Sure. I guess I was thinking about it more from the perspective of the loan portfolio. It sounds like the expectation is --.","Marianne Lake ","Yes, so we saw loan growth year-over-year 8% gross, 3% reported. We feel pretty good about the demand for loan across our business, particularly those have been performing strongly now consistently like business banking like prime mortgage on the portfolio, commercial real estate even also and we are continue to be optimistic about C&I and even cards. So, yes, we would expect to see robust loan growth into next year and hopefully on the back of a continued improvement in the economy. ","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it. So if I were to summarize all of the guidance that you gave today with those comments, it sounds like the expectation is for modestly higher net interest income, fee income reflecting whatever volatility we suffer from in the capital market space, an absolute decline in operating expense, but likely some increase in the provision. Is that generally correct?","Marianne Lake ","I do the NI one for you and on the back of robust loan demand and rising rates in the second half of the year which is our current central case and we would expect NI to be up in the second half of the year, flattish in the first half of the year, obviously those two things, if they payout then that wouldn't be the case. And I like you draw your end conclusion on rest of it.","Jamie Dimon ","You're using the implied curve effectively so that changes and obviously you will expect second half of the year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.","Chris Kotowski","You've been consistent about -- on the issue of dividing the firm up into constituent companies about the strategic benefits of it all, but I wonder if you've done any contingency planning on what if it ever came to the fact that it was too much of a drag to keep it all together? And I guess the question I have is, is it even possible to unscramble the egg and specifically the issue I'm wondering about is you've got over $160 billion of debt at the parent company level. If you were to break the Company up into a consumer bank, a wholesale bank and an asset management business just for argument's sake, is there a way to fairly allocate that debt to the three various lines of business or how would one even go about that?","Jamie Dimon ","Look the unscrambling, it would be extraordinarily complex. And it would be extraordinarily complex in debt, in systems and technology and people and where certain things go and the businesses would start competing with each other right away which I think is perfectly reasonable if they are all separates in the loan and so look we are very conscious of the narrative which had become out there about this but it is far more complex than that. The right way to look at it as we have this great franchises, we have a lot of time to manage through this. And that is our objective not unscrambling egg. We are going to manage through it and we can manage almost every single part of it over I think over a long period like five or seven years. Don't think of over six months or a year. There is nothing we couldn't settle in it, drive down, sell, manage and that would be probably far easier than the alterative. Even if it led to lower growth but it wouldn't necessarily to lower returns. So just keep in mind that obviously we can do the right things at the end of day for shareholders. It might be lower growth and better returns and managing through then not doing certain things at all. Marianne mentioned for example the amount of deposits we take in. Or it might be that we limit and restrict in our deposit we take at quarter end. We do it accommodate clients but all those non operation deposit will directly into the Federal Reserve. That's what Marianne said. We do it and maybe make some Fed gains 25 basis points there and maybe paying the client something. There are some clients we don't charge to take the quarter end. And they are doing business with us and we don't want their quarter end balances. So we have a lot of leverage, we have a lot of time and we will do it very intelligently over time. Not just damages franchises because of current narrative. And the other thing I want to point out about the current narrative which kind of surprises me that people don't mention, when you all talked about P\/Es and some of the parts P\/Es are temporary. P\/Es change over time and the real question we should asking is, is the E going to be much higher or much lower under scenario A or B not just what the P\/E going to be. So that gives a lot of scenario, your Es going to be held lot lower. And that towards the effect of the P\/E change. And PE itself is temporary. JPMorgan is already earning, it is across the capital and you compare it to P\/Es to lot of cousin who aren't earnings across the capital. I mean people expecting the dramatic growth in earnings which they will. And so you -- it is just-- you really got to have much more forward looking view over P\/Es would be, what values would be, what earnings would be, what the franchise would be than just some of the parts breakup based on current P\/Es and false comparison. Just some of the people out there feel a comparative, they are not real comparisons. We are not in the same business as those people so but we are sure conscious. It is not to say we are not going to do the right things for shareholders over time. We will, there are other ways to do it. And the other thing which I think is important too is that we compete globally. Remember, we have to be very conscious who we are competing with and what they are going to do over time. And my guess is you can have some very large, very tough global competition over the next 20 years. They are not going to wait, they may have currently lower G50 charges but I am not sure if can be true 10 years from now. Now particularly the Chinese banks get bigger and bigger and some other global competitors decide they wanted to be in there global businesses. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder of Drexel Hamilton.","David Hilder","Good morning. Thanks very much. On the question of legal costs, and I realize you'll refresh your disclosure in the 10-K, but can you say anything about whether there are other cases or buckets of cases out there that have the potential to cost $1 billion in any one quarter?","Marianne Lake ","No. I would refer you to -- I mean if you look at 10-Q from last quarter that would give you a sense for the things that are outstanding. We will obviously update and refresh in the K but I am not going to discuss specifically all of the remaining cases. ","Jamie Dimon ","David, I think again in either way people, I know we know we caused problem if you all because we have just one big quarter by quarter type stuff, I wouldn't look at this is quarter by quarter issue. If you owned a 100% of this company, the better way to look at it is, it is going to cost us several billion dollars more of somehow plus or minus another couple of billion before we get to normal-- what I call normalized legalized basis. We disclosed all that stuff in 10-K. And I think our RPL, if you ask me it is actually fairly decent way to look at what those might be. And we give you an RPL number which is something has not gone to the P&L which possible and we can't make something which is lumpy not lumpy and we can't make something which we can bucket and putting out, if you could we would all the reserves now they were done.

The several billion dollars that we are going to have to pay for legal of this-- and we want to fix it. And it is unfortunate we do these to you all but it is unavoidable right now.

Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.","Nancy Bush ","Good morning. Two questions. Marianne, we had some numbers last week that indicated rising delinquency in auto loan portfolios and I think your commentary about your losses this quarter kind of confirm that. Are the numbers right now aberrational or is this a seasoning trend or how do you see this?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, so I mean I can talk for JPMorgan very specifically that we are seeing the charge-off rate, remember we've had charge-off rates for the auto business that have been relatively low for an extended period and now we are seeing them revert back to something more normal. And when we think about pricing the business and through the cycle, we concentrate on more normal level of charge-off. So this isn't surprising to us. Having said that what we are also seeing in terms of just the broad competitive space is, is not a rationality necessarily but longer duration, higher LTV more sub prime origination. And JPMorgan, we are low LTV than the industry and very concentrated on the near and super prime space. So as a part of that we are just not participating in but even for our own portfolio, you are going to see some of those charge-off rate trends up to something a bit normal but that's how we think about the business through the cycle. ","Nancy Bush ","Do you feel confident that this is not sort of the canary in the coal mine with regard to perhaps other consumer segments?","Marianne Lake ","I mean I hate to say I'm confident about anything but that's not our expectations ","Jamie Dimon ","Again it is very good question into the full year went into the mortgage thing. We are sub prime was an early indicator freedom prime. But when we look at credit card, we don't think it is early indicator credit card. We will be very conscious. As Marianne said, auto did unbelievably well through the crisis, shockingly well, we will all say so maybe there is return to norm. But we are going to be paying a lot of attention. ","Marianne Lake ","And the lines where origination now that the very further right side of 700 FICO loans with LTV zone and the industry loan is 100%.","Nancy Bush ","Jamie, one final, hopefully final question on the breakup issue. We all listen to what you say about the strategic value of your businesses and the complementary nature of the businesses, et cetera. And it all sounds very logical. But in Washington, there is still a belief that your company in its present form is a danger to the global financial system. Is there any -- in your view, is there any level of capital that is going to mitigate the too big to fail issue or does it go beyond that?","Jamie Dimon ","I think, Nancy, views and facts are completely different, okay. This company was a -- what was a port in the storm in the real crisis in 2008 and 2009. And that was after we booked --, we had no issues whatsoever. Okay, we had a lot more capital now, we are more conservative now. We've got less credit exposure to percentage of balance sheet. We got less risk to the percentage of balance sheet, got more long-term debt, we got more liquid assets. We got more -- so it is even more too today. The fact is the company is a powerful thing. People when they talk about risk, they are just talking about stock-- lot of they feel look at the size there, it scares them. I completely understand that. But that isn't the determinant and I don't think we should be making shareholder decision based on views the people don't mess like really no. And so if the regulators then they want JPMorgan to be split up then that's what have to happen. We can't fight this federal government. That's their intend to-- maybe their intend what it is, if you are going to carry more capital, you got a modest value business model over time to carry capital. That one we think that we can earn a superior return still versus other banks and carry the higher capital and modify our business model over time without taking drastic action. And remember, again, you got to look forward in this. America has been the leader in global capital market to the last 50 or 100 years, it is part of the reason the country is so strong. I look as a matter of public policy. I wouldn't want to see the next JPMorgan Chase to be a Chinese company. And because someone is to be serving the global multi national around the world and all the things that mean the knowledge and experience and research and capabilities and so I think if you look ahead 10 years, you are going to have large global companies to compete. And you may have to be slightly small we might otherwise have been so be it. But if you can do that and do it good return for shareholders we should do that. ","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Marianne, can you tell us -- obviously, you've built up your HQLA in the quarter and your net interest margin came down. How much of the margin pressure was due to the increase in the HQLA?","Marianne Lake ","So I will tell you that - and to answer the question maybe just slightly differently but with the same basic point that we have -- we added the resorting increasing cash of about $45 billion or little bit more than $45 billion in the quarter and not drove the vast majority of the five to six basis points decline in them. ","Gerard Cassidy","And are you guys -- I notice that the deposits at the central banks as you pointed out grew very largely in the quarter. Is this a level that now you're satisfied with? And also connected with that, what as outsiders should we look at that will drive the LCR ratio either higher or lower in terms of your calculation that you're going to be doing on a quarterly basis going forward?","Marianne Lake ","So what it takes, what we have in deposit with the central bank, if any deposits that we have that is excess operating or none operating that we don't think has any significant or any liquidity value to the company. On the whole there is a rule on deposit with central bank and earning a very small amount of interest income, and there are some parts and they try net-net for something slightly accretive. And so that was driving the amount of cash to the degree that we have more non operating cash that would drive that. We complaint with LCR under the U.S. rules with appropriate but modest buffer right now. And that based upon what we think is a fairly forward leaning point of view about what true operating deposit really are. So as we think about what the cashes is in customer's account like really require to operate our businesses and know more. So we think we got a forward leaning point of view on that. So I think the rules for the U.S. final and I think our ratio for U.S. LCR right now will be stable for a period of time. And if there any changes either to the U.S. rule which we don't have any line of sight on or if we are required to make changes or require to make changes to our own internal liquidity framework that could cause us to add liquidity but that's something that will inform you as we go through time. ","Jamie Dimon ","If you look at our balance sheet, okay, we got always real stuff; we have always $500 billion at central bank around the world. We have like $300 billion plus of AA + securities of very short duration. We have like $300 billion of repo on security and stock borrow which is all secured in commodities by top credit with the proper haircut and stuff like that. And with our capital base of equity and capital $200 billion preferred stock of $30 billion TLAC of debt of $150 billion plus, our loan is just $700 billion which probably always been riskiest part of our balance sheet. And it would achieve like ","70 and so this balance sheet, this company is unbelievable. ","Gerard Cassidy","Totally agree. One last thing on those deposits of the central banks, I know some of the big custody banks indicated that they were going to charge their customers that have euro deposits because the ECB is now charging for the deposits at the ECB. Did you guys do that in the quarter and if so how did the customers react when you passed on that cost to them?","Marianne Lake ","So for Fed institutions and non bank -- for bank and non bank financial institutions, yes, we passed on the over night rate for our customers and it is basically on their operating cash flow. So it is what we are doing is passing through the cost, if operating cash for their business so there was --","Jamie Dimon ","In euro.","Marianne Lake ","Yes, in euro. So there was no significant reaction at all. It is market -- ","Jamie Dimon ","It is very hard; I mean not going to be taking deposit at a loss. That is just very temporary to help our client. So I think everyone understand that. ","Operator","And there are no other questions. ","Marianne Lake ","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jamie Dimon ","Bye, thank you very much. Talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you again for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"12227":["JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake.","Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","So starting on page one, the Firm reported net income of $5.9 billion for the quarter and EPS of $1.45 a share and the return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of nearly $25 billion up 4% year-on-year reflecting strong performance.","The quarter was characterized by constructive environment supporting growth trends and underlying performance. We saw higher levels of volatility and client activity on the back of a number of macro events, driving higher market revenues. We also saw strength across IB fees and core loan growth was strong, up 10% year-on-year. Included in the results was Firmwide legal expense of approximately $500 million after tax; outside of legal, other small and notable items on a net basis did not contribute significantly to the results, which means that a more core earnings number would have been well the other side of $6 billion.","Adjusted expense which excludes legal was $14.2 billion, down $100 million from the fourth quarter with adjusted overhead ratio of 57%. And outside of a modest reserve built oil and gas which I\u2019ll come back to, credit trends remained benign and Firmwide net charge-offs remained low at $1.1 billion.","We continued to make progress against our capital targets, reaching Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio of 10.6% while returning over $3 billion to shareholders in the quarter. Finally, we\u2019re pleased that we did not receive an objection to our capital plan and the Board announced its intention to increase the quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.44 a share and authorized gross share repurchases of $6.4 billion.","Before I move on, you\u2019ll notice, we streamlined our earnings press release for the quarter to simplify the format and focusing on key messages.","Skipping over page two, turning to page three on our balance sheet. As I said, the Firm Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio Advanced with 10.6%, up about 45 basis points quarter-on-quarter with earnings model benefit and the combined impact of portfolio run-offs and other RWA reductions being offset by capital distributions. The Fully Phased-In Standardized CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up from 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","While we made very good progress during the first quarter, the pace of capital accretion during the year would be linear, particularly given the timing of model benefit. We continue to expect our ratio to be 11% plus or minus at the end of this year. The Firm and the Bank SLR improved slightly from last quarter at 5.7% and 6% respectively.","On the next page, on page four, we\u2019ve added a new page on our balance sheet, given the objectives we outlined at Investors Day on non-operating deposits. So, turn to page four. As you look at the balance sheet, it\u2019s important to note both on an average and on a spot basis. You look on the left our average balance sheet is higher by $46 billion which reflects a significant ramp up in deposit in the fourth quarter but if you look next to that, you can see on a spot basis, the March is actually relatively flat to December. And if you move to the right, end of period deposits are also flat quarter-on-quarter but with a relatively significant mix shift towards retail deposits with other deposits down $24 billion, predominantly driven by client actions related to non-operating deposits, reflecting good progress towards our goal and what has effectively been a matter of weeks since Investors Day.","We\u2019re actively engaged with our clients and working with them to implement plans to further reduce these deposits and we expect the second quarter to be meaningful in this context. We\u2019re still committed to our goal of reducing them by up to $100 billion by the end of the year.","Moving on to NIM and NII, it\u2019s the high average cash balances on deposit growth as well as some asset reductions that drove the 7 basis-point compression in NIM. And in terms of NII, day count was a large driver of the decline.","Going to page five on Consumer & Community Banking, the combined consumer business has generated $2.2 billion of net income for the quarter and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $10.7 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by healthy growth in balances and in non-interest revenue, partially offset by spread compression. Revenue declined 2% sequentially reported or 4% if you were to exclude the loss in the fourth quarter associated with portfolio exits in card. And this decline is driven by seasonality in NII as well as fewer days in the quarter.","We remain focused on the customer experience and on our strong customer satisfaction rankings and we continue to grow households and see very low levels of attrition. And with deepening relationships, our average deposits are now over $0.5 trillion, up 9% year-on-year. We have record client investment assets up 12%. Our active mobile customer base is up 22%; part sales volume up 8% and our overall loan book grew for the third consecutive quarter with core loan growth of 15% year-on-year. And across CCB, we remain disciplined on expense management. Year-on-year expenses were lower by nearly $250 million and our headcount is down about 1,900 so far this year.","As you will recall that at Investors Day, we committed to reduce expenses by about $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014. And while it will not be exactly linear, you should assume a meaningful down-payment towards that $2 billion in 2015.","Moving to page six, Consumer & Business Banking, CBB generated net income of $828 million for the quarter, up 10% year-on-year and with an ROE of 28%. We continue to see robust performance across our drivers. Average deposit balance growth was up 9%, up $39 billion from last year. And in Business Banking, the momentum we saw in 2014 carried over into 2015 and supported loan originations of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-on-year but with average loan balances up 6% also driven by higher utilization rates.","These underlying drivers helped offset the impact of the low rate environment. NII was down 5% quarter-on-quarter, in line with our guidance, on lower deposit margin which was down 12 basis points, driven by lower reinvestment rates as well as day counts. NII while down seasonally quarter-on-quarter was up 5% year-on-year due to strong client investment and debit revenues. Expenses were down 3% year-on-year reflecting continued improvements in branch efficiency.","Mortgage Banking on page seven. You will notice we\u2019ve simplified the reporting for Mortgage Banking here; it\u2019s now consistent with the other CCB lines of business. But the additional detail by sub line of business is still available in our earnings supplement. So, overall, net income was $326 million for the quarter. Originations were strong at $25 billion, up 7% quarter-on-quarter as we maintained share in a larger market and realized higher revenue margins. And we added $15 billion of high quality loans in the quarter to our balance sheet, driving slightly higher NII quarter-on-quarter despite fewer days.","Although production was higher, our total revenue declined quarter-on-quarter on lower repurchase benefit and lower servicing revenue. Expense of $1.2 billion was down 6% quarter-on-quarter and down 13% year-on-year. But excluding legal would have been down 19% year-on-year over a $0.25 billion despite higher volumes as we continue to tightly control our costs.","On credit, we continue to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and released a $100 million of NCI reserve this quarter. And you can see the net charge-off rate of 30 basis points was down 25 basis points year-on-year.","Moving on to Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto, net income of $1.1 billion down 3% year-on-year with an ROE of 22%; when excluding reserve releases, net income was up 11%. In the quarter, we moved our commercial card loans to the CIB to align with the client relationship. This was a $1.3 billion reduction in card loan balances and relatively modest impact of less than $50 million on each of revenue and expense. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year with the card revenue rate of 12.2% in line with guidance on solid sales growth and reflecting continued investments in acquisition. And in auto, we saw solid loan and lease growth partly offset by spread compression. Expense was up 2% year-on-year predominantly driven by higher auto lease depreciation.","In card, we saw end of period loan growth of $3 billion excluding the commercial card transfer I just mentioned and we saw sales growth of 8%. This sales growth is lower than recent growth rate which has typically been in the double-digit, reflecting the impact of lower gas prices estimated to be about 200 basis points as well as generally competitive environment.","In commerce solutions were gaining share; volume was up 30% year-on-year driven by continued strong spend as well as the addition of new merchants. In auto, results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car value. It was a 14th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth with average balances up 6% year-on-year. Year-to-date the pipeline remains healthy, reflecting continued strength in the market as well as the strength of our manufacturing partners. Finally on credit card, delinquency rate and net charge-offs remained low.","On page nine, the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.6 billion and an ROE of 16%. Revenue was up 8% year-on-year as market conditions in the quarter benefited, both investment banking and market, and our businesses performed well.","In banking, our IB fees of $1.8 billion were up 22% year-on-year. We continue to rank number one in Global IB fees with 8.6% share, up 100 basis points since last year. Advisory fees were up 42% which was a strong start for both JPMorgan as well as the market with some large transactions. In fact, this is our highest first quarter on record and we saw share gains of 150 basis points. Debt underwriting fees were up 16%, driven by acquisition financing; aside from that, debt issuance was generally lower and equity underwriting fees were up 13% in a market that was up only 4%. Our wallet ranked improved to number one, both globally and in the U.S. Looking forward for IB fees, we have some notable large transaction in the first quarter and so we do expect the second quarter to be lower, although our pipeline remains strong.","Treasury services revenue of $1 billion was down 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by lower deposit NII and lower trade finance revenue. And lending revenue was $353 million, up 9%, given dividend on restructured securities.","Moving on to markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 9% year-on-year, but if you exclude business simplification, both total markets as well as fixed income market would have been up 20%. A number of macro events occurred in the quarter including central bank actions, the Swiss Bank decoupling, stronger dollar and oil price volatility which supported market performance broadly and currencies, emerging markets, rates, commodities and equity. In fact, equity had one of its strongest quarters, up 22% with strengths in derivatives and cash, in particular across the U.S. and Asia.","The first half of the quarter was particularly strong. The market has absorbed a number of macro events at this point and recent sentiment is that the Fed will act later rather than same as this year. As a result, while we are still seeing good client flow and volatility is also elevated, it is somewhat lower coming into the second quarter.","With respect to business simplification, in the second quarter, it will have an overall neutral impact to our P&L but will have or drive $300 million decline year-on-year in revenue with a $300 million offset in lower expenses.","Securities services revenue, $934 million was down 9% year-on-year, driven by two factors: First, the impact of change in presentation, supply and revenue sharing agreements in our ADR issuance business. Effective this quarter these pass-through payment declines will be treated as a reduction of revenue having formally been treated as an expense but with no P&L impact. Second, at the end of the fourth quarter of last year, there was a significant client exit and the revenue impact of this is reflected in this quarter\u2019s result. For the remainder of 2015, given those two facts, we expect securities services revenue to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion a quarter, depending on seasonality.","Lastly on expense, total expense was $5.7 billion, up 1% year-on-year, with the comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter, flat year-over-year, and an overhead ratio of 59%. Non-compensation expense declined due to business simplification, partially offset by higher legal expense year-over-year.","Moving on page t 10 on the Commercial Banks, it was a strong quarter with respect to the underlying fundamentals in this business, another record quarter for investment banking revenue with gross revenues of over $750 million. In absolute dollars, it was our strongest quarter ever for loan growth, adding over $5 billion in loans across C&I and CRE and resolved the utilization with asset highest level since 2009. Credit quality remained exceptional with continued low net charge-offs of only 3 basis points.","So overall, financial performance for the quarter was solid; net income was $600 million, on $1.7 billion of revenue and an ROE of 17%. Revenue increased 4% year-on-year driven by record investment banking revenue which was up nearly 70%, on increased equity underwriting and M&A activity was partially offset by continued yield compression.","Expenses increased 3% year-on-year as we continued to invest in controls but our overhead ratio was consistent with the prior year. We\u2019re reaching a peak in control cost in this business and you should expect expenses to stabilize from here. Loan balances increased 11% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans grew 4% sequentially in line with the industry, driven by higher utilization in our corporate client banking book. And in CRE, loan growth was 3% continuing exceed the industry on strong activity in both multi-family lending as well as real estate banking.","Finally on credit and reserve, for the full Firm, we added a little over a $100 million to reserve relating to oil and gas exposure this quarter, majority of which was here in the commercial banking. We review our energy exposure on a name-by-name basis and under a range of commodity price assumptions. This quarter\u2019s reserve build was at downgrade in the E&P portfolio and if the current price environment continues, it\u2019s reasonable to expect some further reserve builds during 2015 but relatively modest.","However, in the context of a funded portfolio of $15 billion, this is a very modest build and is fully within the range of our expectations at this part of a cycle for energy. And although we\u2019re taking reserves, it is not clear that it will translate into credit losses as the industry and our clients are not standing still but actively working to manage liquidity and leverage in the face of lower prices.","Moving to page 11 and asset management: A good quarter in asset management; net income of $500 million and ROE of 22% and 27% pretax margin on $3 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year driven by flows and higher banking balances. And expense of $2.2 billion was up 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments in infrastructure and controls and including modest legal expenses. This marked the 24th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows of $16 billion driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion, up 7% year-over-year and client assets of $2.4 trillion. This strengthened multi-asset and equity flows.","In banking, we reported strong balances in both lending and deposits. Average loan balances were up 8% year-on-year and average deposits up 6%. And we reported strong investment performance with 79% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second cortiles over five years.","Turning to Corporate and turning to page 12, Treasury & CIO reported a net loss of $221 million, but the result included a loss in the quarter of $173 million pre-tax primarily due to a timing impact of cost associated with certain non-operating deposits we planned to exit.","On Other Corporate, as we\u2019ve completed the spin-off of OEP and other portfolio sales during the first quarter, the remaining private equity business is not expected to be a significant contributor to the Firm\u2019s earnings. Therefore beginning this quarter and going forward, we will be disclosing our corporate private equity results as a part of Other Corporate. This quarter private equity contributed a modest positive to the results. Also including the results for Other Corporate was $300 million pretax of legal expense which is largely offset by a $177 million of net income on tax items.","Moving to page 13 and the outlook, I\u2019ve addressed most of this guidance through the presentation; I just want to highlight a couple of items: First, in CCB and the consumer businesses a couple of geography points relative to analyst models. We guided in the fourth quarter to expect the first quarter\u2019s consumer bank revenues to be down on deposit margin compression; we saw that this quarter as expected and we expect deposit margins to remain impressive as rates remain low.","In the mortgage bank at Investor Day, we guided for revenues to be down approximately $1 billion for the year on lower servicing revenues as well as lower repurchase benefit. We saw some of that this quarter and that guidance remains. Against that, as I said earlier, across CCB, we do expect to deliver a meaningful portion of the $2 billion expense reduction guidance in 2015. Finally on this page asset management for the full year, expect the pretax margin and ROE to be at the low end of through the cycle target range.","So, wrapping up, a strong result for the quarter in a consecutive environment, we saw strong market and transaction activity despite continued margin compression. The performance continues to reflect the strength of each of our franchises; strong market revenue and IB fees; 9% growth in retail deposit; 10% core loan growth and good progress against our capital, our balance sheet and our expense commitment.","With that operator, please can you open up the line to questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Just one quick clarification question on the performance and actually, this was great. You mentioned pretty much across the board. Do you think there is any seasonality; any one-time events; block trades, anything like that that would lift such good performance in the quarter?","Marianne Lake","It wasn\u2019t anything particularly noteworthy in terms of one-time events; it was really quite broad, particularly in derivatives and cash. The performance was I would say solid year-over-year because we saw strength in the America this year but we had strength in Europe last year. And I think the first quarter 2014 wasn\u2019t particularly strong, so I think we were flatten a little bit with a relative comparison but it was a really strong absolute and we think strong relative performance.","Glenn Schorr","And maybe just a related question but I\u2019m not sure which line it would flow through. For my understanding, you guys and others have been pushing or talking with prime brokerage clients to help improve our ROEs in the business. Is part of that following through and just better equity performance, more business with clients?","Marianne Lake","Yes, this is where it would be. I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s a driver but we are as we said and the whole industry is looking to work with clients to optimize the use of balance sheet and improve return. So we think some of that, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was a key driver.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Switching gears, in Jamie\u2019s letter, you talked about -- mentioned the need to push the new G-SIB rules to the product and the client level. And it piqued my curiosity. And I am just curious, how different is that from what you have already done? In other words, each step of the way you have been early and adapting and pushing out to the desk level. How your capital charge is? Is this just meaning more of the same, meaning higher capital charge, higher capital charge or is this something different there that you need to do?","Marianne Lake","No, I mean, it is more of the same. Obviously G-SIB took on a slightly heightened focus when we had some doubling happen in the proposal in December. So, we\u2019ve always been measuring and monitoring and tracking G-SIB at a very granular level but we are obviously on a path now to aggressively manage it, which means that we are going to be just a little bit more focused on that constraint and uniquely also with advanced capital standardized limit balance sheet caps; the like. So, it\u2019s more of the same honestly than just a heightened focus on this, given the U.S. proposal and given the impact of at least at this point, FX translation.","Jamie Dimon","And different than RWA, it affects certain products more than others and we pointed non-operating deposits, stuff like that; certain businesses more knows, we\u2019ve pointed out clearing and certain clients more than others, we\u2019ve pointed out financial institutions. So, just kind of a multivariant theme; it\u2019s not mystical. And we are actually already planning to re-price some of these businesses to get an adequate return on use of capital and we\u2019re seeing other people do that.","Marianne Lake","That\u2019s right. I mean we maybe in a different position with G-SIB but others are leverage constraint. And just generally speaking, we are starting to see a lot more discipline around balance sheet and pricing is following somewhat generally.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","I was wondering on net interest income, given outlook for how the net interest income dollars could trend from here, assuming that you don\u2019t get much help from higher rates, what are the key drivers and what\u2019s kind of your outlook for NIM and NII dollars for the year?","Marianne Lake","So, again assuming for a second that rates don\u2019t rise into the backend -- at the end of the year, I mean come back to that if you look, we would expect our NII dollars to be stable to slightly up because we\u2019re still seeing growth in our interest earning assets. Obviously this quarter, we were down some on day count; it was a big chunk of the quarter-on-quarter reduction. So, we\u2019re really going to see the biggest lift in NII when we do see rates rise, we see when that is. And similarly on our NIM, we would expect NIM to be stable, particularly given as we talked about what we\u2019re seeing early on NIM, more particularly over the course of the last year or two have been this significant increase in cash and we\u2019re going to see some of that, at least stabilizing term as we start to reduce our non-operating deposits and we should see our NIM relatively stable and again start to rise when rates rise.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your next question; it comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. On the CCAR, do you expect any potential surcharges on the CCAR to come out when the U.S. final rules on SIFI buffers come out? And in addition to that, have you learned anything from the CCAR in terms of the transparency of the process; is there progression in terms of the back and forth of the regulators as either through the CCAR process and their expectations?","Marianne Lake","So taking your first point Erika, obviously I don\u2019t know the next time we\u2019re going to and will likely get CCAR instructions including the rules and the minimums is likely to be sometime towards the end of this year for the next CCAR cycle as we get prepared to deliver that. So all I can say is what you know which is clearly the door was left opened for the minimum to be increased or potentially to include some element of the surcharge. We are hopeful that that won\u2019t be the case because we would say the surcharge should be carried in baseline times to be used in stress and to have all firms to end up well capitalized afterwards but have no more insights than that for you.","With respect to the dialogue with the Fed, it\u2019s definitely much, much further progressed than it was two years and three years ago and every year it gets better in terms of the bilateral conversations and it\u2019s constructive. I don\u2019t think however you could today or will likely ever be able to characterize it as transparent and clear, maybe potentially by designs in terms of understanding or being able to reconcile exactly what their models do and what theirs results are driven by. So, I won\u2019t be able to clarify for you what changed in there is also what this is between us and theirs but the dialogue itself is definitely more constructive and more bilateral and more continuous.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","The drop in the adjusted expense is I think about 3% year-over-year, came in little bit better than we were thinking while revenues were also little bit better. Obviously you\u2019ve got a lot of cost saving programs underway that you mentioned earlier on the call and at Investor Day. But should we think that maybe you are running ahead of schedule or that the cost saves could be more or is it just lumpiness as we go quarter-over-quarter?","Marianne Lake","I think the best way to answer that is that we are still firmly with our guidance of adjusted expenses being $57 billion plus or minus by the end of the year or for the year, sorry. Obviously we will always try and outperform that but I wouldn\u2019t characterize one quarter as a change in our guidance at this point.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then just separately, obviously a big company out there announced its exiting most of its banking assets and just wondering if there is any interest or appetite within your commercial bank to bulk up the acquisition there in terms of the asset purchases versus the complete company?","Marianne Lake","I mean the most important thing obviously in all of that is that we were delighted to be able to partner with the large company on their strategic transformation and that\u2019s the most important thing about that transaction for us. I am not going to comment specifically on whether or what JPMorgan will be interested in terms of asset purchases. We are much more focused on partnering strategically with the company.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Chris Spahr","Hi, this is Chris Spahr on behalf of Mike Mayo. I just had a question relating to your CET1 ratio guidance. Do you give any kind of guidance on the Tier 1 leverage by -- ratio by the end of this year given your CET1 of 11%?","Marianne Lake","No, we haven\u2019t given any specific guidance Chris.","Chris Spahr","Do you think there is any way you will be able to manage that ratio higher in the context of this year\u2019s CCAR?","Marianne Lake","In the context of the CCAR we just had?","Chris Spahr","Yes.","Marianne Lake","We expect our -- it\u2019s little complicated this year and we sort of articulated at Investor Day because we\u2019re going to move at some point whether it\u2019s a third or fourth quarter to have standardized the RWA be our binding constraint. So, 11% plus or minus is our target on CET1 and that\u2019s what we said.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Marianne, you mentioned that treasury service revenues were down due to the trade finance revenue area. And I noticed on the balance sheet that trade finance outstandings have dropped meaningfully on a year-over-year basis. Can you share with us what\u2019s going on in that line of business?","Marianne Lake","There is a couple of different things, one was a little specific. We had a portfolio of loans that we held for sale and subsequently exit from the balance sheet which drive some of it, but in addition to generally a competitive environment and lower demand particularly in Asia.","Gerard Cassidy","And then second, you mentioned that you obviously had a very strong advisory business in the quarter and you gained market share of 150 basis points. Do you have any sense of who you took the market share from; was it European investment banks or U.S.?","Marianne Lake","Not specifically; I will tell you that while we\u2019re obviously delighted with the performance, it was a relatively strong market and there were some larger transactions. So, we\u2019re happy with the gains but I can\u2019t specifically comment on where it came from. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim.","Eric Wasserstrom","I just wanted to follow-up on your energy comments. Could you help us understand what events it was that led to reserve building; was it company specific events in the form of bankruptcies or just something else in your internal ratings migration?","Marianne Lake","Yes, it\u2019s definitely moving assets. So basically, if you think about the E&P portfolio in particular when we think about the redetermination somewhat semiannually of the borrowing base and look those companies on a client specific name-by-name basis and with some contraction in the borrowing base networks and downgrades that drive our reserving methodology; it doesn\u2019t mean that we feel that those companies are necessarily in significant difficulty, but that\u2019s the way the reserving methodology works. And as I said, we do this on a client-by-client basis. We\u2019re comfortable with our exposures and clients looking to manage their own defensive position. So, it\u2019s not clear that they will necessarily be realized in losses, in fact it\u2019s implied curve rather than flat to long order prices is in fact how things play out, it\u2019s possible that there will be very little in a way of credit loss we\u2019d assume.","Eric Wasserstrom0","And just on the last point, your view on that is because of recovery in prices rather than restructuring actions or things that your clients are undertaking; is that fair or is it bit of a \u2026?","Marianne Lake","Both.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","I just wanted to see if I could just follow-up on the energy point. Obviously you have the reserving and then you mentioned the 200 basis-point impact on spend. I am wondering if you just expand the discussion of energy; are there positive offsets that you\u2019re starting to see in the businesses elsewhere either in terms of whether it\u2019s credit or borrowing or investment banking opportunities that maybe popping up? How do you -- can you summarize the benefit if at this point you can see any positive offsets?","Marianne Lake","First of all just on the contraction in spend given volatile prices, it\u2019s pretty typical in this part of the cycle that you would see lower energy prices in the first instance drive savings rates up and you see consumer spend for the energy dividend so to speak lag back. So it\u2019s the fact that we saw that happen in the first quarter; it\u2019s not atypical and it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t expect the spend to grow and for that energy dividend to ultimately translate into high spend also; it\u2019s more of a normal timing phenomenon is our expectation. But with respect to other activity -- yes, we saw active equity capital markets with defensive -- some defensive issuance and generally I think it\u2019s a positive overall for the businesses and for the economy.","Ken Usdin","And my follow-up question is just with respect to the security services business, you mentioned the change in presentation and then there was the client loss. Is there a way you can help us understand just what the organic growth rate of the businesses adjusted for the reclassification, just whether it\u2019s on a sequential quarter or year-over-year basis?","Marianne Lake","Not readily, but we can get back to you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just talk, go back to the capital ratio issue for a second. You noted that standardized your 10.8 and then you still feel that will be your constraining factor by the end of this year. So if you\u2019re already at 10.8, your target is 11; I know it\u2019s plus or minus, but it does seem like maybe you got three quarters and 20 basis points. So, is there anything unusual you\u2019re expecting in the coming quarters or is it just, hey, you can never know quarter-to-quarter, but all else being equal, looks like you can probably hit 11 if not better; is that a fair way to think about it?","Marianne Lake","Yes, nothing specific to call out in the second half of the year and we should hit 11 if not a little better, yes.","Jim Mitchell","And as you look at the surcharge, the G-SIB surcharge more, the proposals, do you feel better or worse; you feel -- is there any areas where you think you can pull the lever more significantly to improve that ratio or lower the charge?","Marianne Lake","I would say seven weeks or six weeks whatever it is, after Investor Day that the messaging hasn\u2019t really change which is we have every intention of aggressively managing the score, doing as we talked about earlier in a very granular way. And we\u2019re already working on that. And you see that in the most obvious state which is in reduction already to-date in non-operating deposit. But we continue to work on all of the things, so derivative notional compression, level three assets, financing and obviously we\u2019re still thinking about what the response should be in terms of risk intermediation or clearing. And so I think six weeks on from Investor Day, the story is the same. We feel we are fully committed to ensuring that we are closely within the 4.5% bucket and we may not stop that but we\u2019re only a few months into this.","Operator","You have a question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Marianne, going back to the reserve build which obviously was done for the oil and gas as you mentioned, can you share with us, in the corporate and investment bank, I know on a total dollar amount relative to the corporation, it\u2019s not significant, but there is a big increase in the non-accrual loans from 110 to 251 in the quarter. Can you give us some color on what drove that?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I would -- obviously, you noted it\u2019s from a small base, so that\u2019s notable. There are two specific exposures that were moved for non-accrual. One of them was moved on a somewhat of a technicality, sovereign downgrade which we fully expect to recover on but that\u2019s just the way we have to present it; and other smaller piece was one other isolated exposure. So, I wouldn\u2019t over think it right now; it\u2019s two exposures and it\u2019s $200 million.","Gerard Cassidy","And that was not oil and gas related obviously, it\u2019s in the CIB area that was in the commercial bank?","Marianne Lake","The first, the sovereign downgrade was -- did have oil and gas underlying exposure but again it was on a technicality rather than on the fundamentals of the company. And we fully expect to recover on that.","Jamie Dimon","But focus on the very, very smaller number.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","You highlighted the Swiss franc as a tailwind for FICC. Could you maybe size that for us?","Marianne Lake","No, I will just say overall our sense is that the market is neutral relative to the event we happened to be able to benefit from it; some others will be neutral and some may have lost that. So these things happen regular way in trading businesses and it just happens to be the case that that event and the volatility it drove is good for us and our franchise. And I think it\u2019s fair to show you that we\u2019re in a business where expertise matters and risk decision matters and we were able to capitalize on both of those, not just for the Swiss franc but also for the other macro events in the quarter.","Brennan Hawken","Sure, I know that the higher volatility of course would drive higher volume. I was just talking about the event specifically and if there was some one-time gains involved in that so that we can kind of adjust for a core figure here?","Marianne Lake","No I wouldn\u2019t characterize in this one-time gain; I would categorize in this one of a number of items that drove our performance in the business.","Brennan Hawken","And then on the energy front, a lot of the focus was on the CB and the energy exposure there but you all mentioned that there is exposures in CIB too. Can you give us maybe an update if there was any changes in any of those exposures or loans this quarter?","Marianne Lake","I mean overall in the total Firm, the reserve built that we took was a little over $100 billion four-fifth of which was in the commercial bank. So, we did experience; we do all of this on a name by name basis, so we did across our portfolios but the majority was in the CB E&P portfolio.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul Miller","On your deposit discussion about pushing out, I think you said during your Investors Day that you\u2019d like to get about $3 billion of the non-core deposits off the balance sheet. And I know you said that you hope to make progress in the second quarter. How should we model that out and what type of benefit have you modeled out to the NIM with that $3 billion of deposits?","Jamie Dimon","It was $100.","Paul Miller","$100 billion, I am sorry.","Marianne Lake","No worries, $100 billion. I mean look at the end of the day you can see that over the course of the last -- since over the third quarter of 2012, our cash balances grew by couple of hundred billion dollars and that has been a very large contributor for the compression in our NIM, not the only one. So as we push out the non-operating deposits, we would expect to see that help but remember we\u2019re still growing retail deposits. So if you look at this quarter in particular, even though we reduced our non-op deposits related to client actions by about $20 billion and the majority of that $24 billion, we have flat deposit. So, we\u2019re continuing to grow the good retail deposit. So I would say it would be a tailwind but it will be a tailwind for stabilizing and slightly improving NIM outside of rate rises.","Paul Miller","And then real quick on your professional services, professional services was down like from $2 billion to $1.6 billion. Is that mainly due to some of that legal cost maybe starting to go away from the crisis?","Marianne Lake","I am sorry, off the top of my head, I can\u2019t remember the number you are saying. But no, our legal expenses; forget the legal expense that relates to reserves that we\u2019ve taken and the settlements that we reached. Regular way, expense for third parties in legal isn\u2019t down substantially quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year just although at some point it will be.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak","Marianne, I was hoping that we could dig into the RWA progress that we saw in the quarter. And specifically I was hoping that you could just aggregate how much of the sequential decline that we saw was a function of the planned mitigation actions and model benefits that you\u2019ve cited versus actual FX driven declines? Because assuming that the U.S. dollar strength persists all else equal, one could surmise that we should expect RWAs in a long-term context actually coming out below that $1.5 trillion target that you\u2019ve cited in the past?","Marianne Lake","So, specifically with respect to the quarter, I would say that the wholesale parameter update -- our wholesale credit parameter update model benefit is up about a half of the RWA reduction with the other half coming from regular way portfolio run-off as well as some reductions in market risk associated with market risk positions; reductions in private equity; reductions in commitment systems, some position in reductions rather than driven specifically by FX. We\u2019re running above $1.5 trillion now. And we said we\u2019re going to manage both the advance and standardize to that number over the course of next couple of years. So, its FX -- its currency translation is at tailwinds and we would hope to do better but at this point, let\u2019s get there.","Steven Chubak","And another question on capital but relating to CCAR, Marianne you\u2019ve noted on this call and in the past that you don\u2019t expect CCAR to be JPMorgan\u2019s binding constraint longer term. But just given the reduction that we saw and that ask [ph] or the need use the mulligan in the last exam; I was just hoping you could cite some of the plan mitigation actions that you expect to pick so that we could see you guys get on the path towards delivering on that 55% to 75% net pay out target.","Marianne Lake","At the moment, CET1 ratio launching into CCAR was 10% or below 10%, not the 12% that we expect to run out when once we build our capital to our target level. So you are right that right now on the CCAR, Tier 1 leverage was our binding constrain, both last year and this year. So a combination of our capital strategy around how we think about the issuance of preferred together with balance sheet actions will be how we think about mitigating that limitation in medium term. But ultimately it doesn\u2019t change the fact that once we get to our target assuming that is the 12% that we articulated at Investor Day, but again we don\u2019t think we should be leveraged constrained. So we\u2019re going to work on that obviously and we\u2019re continuing to build capital but when we launched into CCAR, we won at that level.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.","Nancy Bush","Jamie, you warned in your annual letter about the possibility of another flash crash. Yesterday, I think Simon Potter at the Fed warned about it and cited HFT is one of the issues. Larry Summers warned about it about a week ago. Are these warnings going anywhere; I mean are they being translated into action anywhere in the system?","Jamie Dimon","To give it a little perspective, I also spoke in that the banking system is much stronger to start with and every bank in the system is much stronger. So just trying to think through what are the effects of some of these things. And we look at that kind of a warning shot across the bow. What I would worry about more is what happens in a stressed environment. I think people are paying attention to what\u2019s going on in the markets and there has to be changes down the road; there might be some changes that are relevant to that.","Nancy Bush","Secondly Marianne, a question about commercial banking; the returns in commercial banking have remained in sort of the high teens over the last number of quarters then it\u2019s certainly respectable sort of 17% to 19%. Is there anyway those returns improve materially or as rates go up or does that get offset by competitive factors? And are we at sort of a normalized level for that business?","Marianne Lake","The best way to think about that is through the cycle target that those that we Doug Petno put out at Investor Day which is 18%. So that doesn\u2019t mean to say that we won\u2019t benefit when rates rise in this business; it\u2019s very competitive and spreads are compressing and there is a lot of factors going on but through this cycle 18%, so with some years below and some above. The question on core growth and security services outside of presentation changes and client exists is currently in the low single-digit. So obviously a little bit muted because we\u2019re working on balance sheet optimization but certainly growing and in the low single-digit. But in terms of looking at advisory and who we are gaining share from, principally European banks. No more questions?","Operator","There are no more questions.","Marianne Lake","Thanks everybody.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward looking statements at the back of the presentation.","The firm made a net loss of $380 million for the third quarter, on the back of very significant litigation expenses. So I want to take you first to page two. We\u2019ve added this page for this quarter only, as we want to be as transparent with you as we can be and give you as complete a picture as possible of our litigation reserves and the current perspective on the evolution of our reasonably possible range of losses for litigation. And as you know, as transparent as we would like to be, we are necessarily constrained in what we can actually say. ","Having said that, on page two, I\u2019ll start by saying that we appreciate that the litigation expense of $9.2 billion is much more significant than you\u2019ve been expecting. It\u2019s much more significant that we expected until very recently. ","The reality is that over the last few weeks, the environment\u2019s become highly charged and very volatile. Things have been very fluid, and the situation escalated to the point where we\u2019re facing very large premiums and penalties, the level of which has gone far beyond what we reasonably expected. However, those are the facts we\u2019re dealing with today in our reserving actions this quarter and are trying as hard as possible to put these issues behind us. ","So let me take you quickly through the table on the top of page two, which is a roll-forward of our reserves. We started 2010 with $3 billion in reserves, added around $28 billion through the third quarter, including the actions this period, and have settled a little less than $8 billion across matters, which leaves us with $23 billion approximately of ending reserves, which relate to a broad range of matters and includes a significant reserve for mortgage related matters, including both securities and repurchase litigation exposure. Remember, our GSE repurchase reserves of over $2 billion are separate from this.","The balance at quarter end reflects the $9.2 billion we\u2019re expensing this quarter. This expense also covers a range of matters, including but not limited to mortgage-backed securities. And the impact from their income you can see is high as it\u2019s being effected by a portion of the expense estimated to relate to enforcement penalties, which would not be tax deductible.","Again, these estimates relate to a number of cases including, among other things, mortgage, as well as the recently announced CIO settlements. We do expect litigation expenses to normalize over time to much lower levels, but they may be somewhat lumpy quarter over quarter.","Finally, on this page we\u2019ve included a table which shows a revised range of reasonably possible losses. And those are losses that would be in addition to our reserves. And remember, it\u2019s pre-tax. It\u2019s very important to emphasize that when estimating this range, it\u2019s difficult, and there are significant inherent uncertainties and judgments required. ","As you can see, this was estimated at $6.8 billion last quarter, and while the range has gone down versus last quarter, it\u2019s only gone down modestly in comparison to the reserve adds. Think of it simply as if the estimate of what was reasonably possible back in the second quarter reflected our best assessment of the environment we were in and our best judgment at that time. ","But as I said, we didn\u2019t, even a few weeks ago, reasonably expect things to have escalated to where they are now, so we have therefore revised our range to better reflect the reality of this current environment, with a range of up to $5.7 billion.","And before we go back to page one, just a final comment, as we said in the press release, the board and senior management continue to seek fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues, but at this time, we are unable to report on any specifics.","So just flipping back to page one and just to finish of the front page, the other significant item we\u2019ve highlighted on the page is the combined $1.6 billion of loan loss reserve releases for the consumer businesses. And if you add the two significant items in the table, which we don\u2019t consider to be core to our earnings, they total a loss of $6.2 billion and $1.59 of EPS in the negative.","If you adjust our results for these two non-core items, we would have earned $5.8 billion and an EPS of $1.42 with a return on tangible common equity of 15%. And that\u2019s not to discount the items, but rather to show the strength of our underlying performance.","The businesses showed double-digit growth in key drivers, as well as market share gains in consumer and CIB, in banking and market. For the second consecutive year, we led the nation in deposit growth, up 10%. Credit card sales volumes were up 11%, and we maintained our number one IDC ranking with 130 basis points increase in market share. And asset management saw $19 billion of long term net inflows, the 18th consecutive quarter.","So turning with that to page four, and the details of our balance sheet and capital, first, after allowing for dividends and repurchases, our capital declined in the quarter by approximately $2 billion. As a result, our Basel III tier one common ratio remained flat at 9.3% quarter over quarter with the decline in capital being offset by lower risk-weighted assets, primarily driven by legacy portfolio runoff.","We\u2019re targeting 9.5% by the end of this year, and still aiming to run at about a 50 to 100 basis point buffer above this level over time. And our 2014 CCAR submission will take both these targets into consideration as well as maintaining the flexibility to increase dividends and to repurchase shares. And just to note, our Basel III ratio under the advanced approach is currently lower than under the standardized approach.","An update, then, on leverage. The firm-wide supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules remains at 4.7% this quarter, and similarly the bank leverage ratio remains at 4.3%. And as you know, comment letters were provided recently relating to both the U.S. [MPR] as well as Basel proposals, which included requests for revised treatment for certain assets and exposures. And we don\u2019t know what the outcome of the final rules will be, but it\u2019s possible there will be some things that improve those numbers. ","Finally, we remain compliant with LCR this quarter, and have HQLA of over $530 billion, with around $350 billion in cash at central banks. And as you know, we resubmitted our CCAR at the end of September and expect to receive feedback from the Fed in early December.","So now let\u2019s turn to business performance, and while the environment has been, and continues to be, very challenging, remember that there are more than 250,000 people in this company, focused day in and day out on serving our customers and communities. So with that, on page five I\u2019ll start with consumer and community banking.","The combined consumer businesses generated $2.7 billion of net income for the quarter, on $11 billion of revenue and with an ROE of 23%. As expected, we\u2019ve seen a sharp drop in mortgage banking origination volumes and margins. That impacted non-interest revenue in the quarter.","But taking a look at the franchise, we ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches, over 19,000 ATMs, and 1,900 Chase private client locations. And we continue to see really strong growth in the underlying drivers for the consumer businesses. Average deposits were up $40 billion year on year, an increase of 10%. ","And for the second year in a row, we led the FDIC survey with the highest deposit growth, and a growth rate more than twice the industry average, with that strength being broad-based across markets. We\u2019re number one in our three largest markets, and we gained share in 20 of the 25 largest markets.","Our active mobile customer base grew by 30% year on year. We had record credit card sales volume of $107 billion, up 11% year on year and outperforming the industry for the fifth consecutive year.","This quarter also had record client investment assets of $179 billion, up 16% year on year, reflecting the strong positive momentum of the Chase private client initiative as well as overall higher market levels.","And to close, a moment on expenses, which were down $89 million year on year, primarily due to lower mortgage banking expenses. And across CCB, we will have reduced headcount by over 15,000 for the full year of 2013.","Turning to page six, consumer and business banking, we generated net income of $762 million and an ROE of 27% on net revenue of $4.4 billion, up 2% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter.","Net interest income is up 3% quarter on quarter, driven by the strong growth in deposits I mentioned, partially offset by spread compression. But for the first time in about three years, the deposit margin has not declined quarter over quarter, meaning that rate compression is being offset by higher reinvestment rates. And at current market rates, we would expect, all other things being equal, for our deposit margins to be relatively stable in the medium-term.","On the noninterest revenue side, we continue to see strong growth in both debit and investment revenue. Expenses are up year on year, reflecting the investments we\u2019ve made in the business, including Chase Private Client as well as costs related to strengthening control and compliance.","And a minute on business banking. You can see loan balances are flat quarter over quarter, up 2% versus last year, and production levels have stabilized at around these levels with a healthy pipeline in that context.","Turning to page seven, and the mortgage bank, overall mortgage banking net income was around $700 million, with an ROE of 14%. And the short story here is significantly lower production income, offsetting higher reserve releases. But if you start at the top with production pre-tax, we guided you that production pre-tax margins would be slightly negative in each of the third and fourth quarters. And excluding repurchases, you can see that\u2019s the case for the third quarter, with a net loss of $85 million, or a net negative 21 basis points of pre-tax margins.","As you see, revenues are down over 50% quarter on quarter. This reflects both a reduction in [locks] and the impact of a mix change together driving 120 basis points of revenue margin compression in the quarter. ","While [locks] are down 40%, quarter on quarter closed loan volumes were down 17%, reflecting a pull through of the second quarter pipeline. And although you do see that our expenses are down some, around 7%, this reflects primarily the transaction level variable costs. We have taken appropriate actions this quarter to adjust capacity, which will fully hit our run rate in exit Q4. ","On the positive side, our purchase volumes continue to increase and purchase mix was nearly 50% of loans this quarter, up from 35% last quarter.","Moving on to servicing, a loss of $226 million pre-tax, excluding MSR risk management. Lower revenues were down due to a couple of items, including the exit of lender pays reinsurance. On an adjusted basis, the servicing revenue would have been up slightly, reflecting the impact of higher rates. ","Also, servicing expenses were $858 million for the quarter, including approximately $200 million of foreclosure-related matters. If you adjust for this, our core expenses would have been around $650 million, on track for the approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as we guided at investor day.","Finally, you see the MSR showed a modest loss this quarter of $180 million, which includes a negative $120 million due to further HPI improvements, which is also driving higher reserve releases in the real estate portfolios. ","So, on to the real estate portfolio. Pre-tax income of $1.5 billion includes net chargeoffs of a little over $200 million with chargeoffs expected at around that same level next quarter. As expected, a continued reduction in delinquencies, but importantly improvement in HPI, drove severity down in both NCI and PCI portfolios, which led us to release a combined $1.25 billion of reserves this quarter.","Turning the page to page eight, we\u2019ll do card, merchant services, and auto. Revenue of $4.6 billion was down slightly year on year and quarter on quarter as a result of spread compression despite strong sales volumes, with net income of $1.2 billion, up 29% year on year, and an ROE of 26%, excluding reserve releases, which reflect strong and consistent growth in sales and exchange revenue.","In card, year over year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was consistent and strong, and 11% and 14% respectively, and we saw a slight increase in average outstandings quarter on quarter. Expenses are flat year over year, and down a little quarter over quarter, but the second quarter included a one-time item.","The net chargeoff rate has reached historic lows at 2.86%, which is down over 70 basis points year on year, and we released $350 million of loan loss reserves this quarter. We expect an additional $150 million of reserve releases next quarter, consistent with our guidance for the second half of the year.","Before we move on, a few words on auto, with originations up 2% year on year and balances 4% year on year. And despite higher rates leading to increased competitive intensity, we\u2019re still expecting growth in the fourth quarter year over year.","Moving on to slide nine, the corporate and investment bank. We had very strong performance in CIB, with net income of $2.2 billion and an ROE of 16%, despite being a seasonally weaker third quarter and including a DVA loss of nearly $400 million.","As usual, we\u2019ll focus on the numbers excluding DVA. We had net income of $2.5 billion on revenues of $8.6 billion, and an ROE of 17%. In banking, total revenue was $2.9 billion, and we maintained our number-one ranking in global IB fees, with $1.5 billion, up 6% year on year. ","We were up in a market that is down overall in wallet, and captured 130 basis points of wallet share over last year. Our market share gains were significantly larger than any of the other top ten players, and supported by landmark transactions like Verizon. ","I\u2019ll take a segment to just give you some color on the strong competitive performance in ECM this quarter. We\u2019re number one year to date in terms of wallet, gaining 140 basis points of share and this quarter we\u2019re number one in volume, number one in wallet, and number one in deals.","Moving on to markets, $4.7 billion of revenue, down 2% year on year, versus a strong third quarter last year, in line with our guidance that we provided at Barclays. Fixed income markets revenue of $3.4 billion was down 8% year on year, but remember, the third quarter of 2012 did include modest losses in the synthetic credit portfolio.","Equity markets revenues of $1.2 billion were up 20% year on year, with broad-based strength across cash and derivatives and across regions. Security service revenue of $1 billion was up 3% year on year, with growth in custody and fund services partially offset by lower agent lending spreads. And credit adjustments and other of a negative $409 million was almost entirely DVA.","Expenses of $5 billion were down 7% year on year, primarily driven by comp, with a comp to revenue ratio of 27% for the quarter. Loans were down slightly, primarily due to trade finance. And finally, average CIB VAR remained relatively flat quarter over quarter at $45 million. The current quarter continues to reflect historically low levels of volatility as well as continued risk reduction.","I\u2019ll skip page 10 and take you to page 11 and the commercial bank. The quarter saw net income of $665 million on revenue of $1.7 billion, with an ROE of 20%. Revenues were flat year on year and quarter on quarter, reflecting pressure on NII, offset by favorable franchise trends.","Spreads compressed in the quarter 5 basis points or so from a relatively stable landscape in the last few quarters, across most client segments and geographies. And given the environment, it\u2019s likely spreads will continue to be under some pressure.","In terms of loan balances of $135 billion, up 9% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter. This remains a tale of two cities. The commercial real estate business continues to grow strongly, up 4% quarter on quarter with loan growth outpacing the market and growing every month for the last 13 months. Multifamily fundamentals are very strong, and traditional commercial real estate is building momentum, with both CRE and multifamily pipelines remaining robust.","However, in C&I, demand remains soft and competitive pressures high, the combination of which has continued to drive relatively flat C&I loans in the quarter. And we continue to focus on quality over growth. Every day we\u2019re adding new policy clients, clients with whom we expect to do lots of business over decades to come, and we\u2019ve added over 600 of these clients year to date. And aside from lending, we continue to cross-sell our existing clients. To evidence that, growth IB revenues were a record $448 million for the quarter, up 16%. ","Before we leave CB, two final points. Expenses were up 10% year over year, reflecting higher product and headcount expenses as we invest in front office and controls. And credit reflected a release this quarter, as the risk profile of the portfolio continues to improve. ","Page 12, and asset management, another very strong quarter for asset management, with net income of $476 million, up 7% year on year and an ROE of 21%. Revenue was $2.8 billion, up 12% over last year, and while overall high market levels did help, very strong fund performance and flows drove the story. 74% of our mutual fund AUM is ranked in the first or second quartiles of performance over five years. And we saw $19 billion of long term net inflows. This is the 18th consecutive quarter of long term net inflows.","Importantly, we saw this in every single long term asset class, in every region, and it brought our year to date long term flows to $74 billion, which compares to just less than $60 billion for the full year of 2012.","We ended the quarter with AUM of $1.5 trillion, up 12% year on year, and in banking, we continue to see deposit and loan growth across the board. And while we expect loan growth to continue to be relatively strong, it\u2019s likely to be somewhat lower in Q4 given the lower mortgage pipeline.","Expenses increased 16% year on year, as we continue to grow and invest in client advisors. And looking forward, we expect long term flows to remain positive and the breadth of our platform to enable us to grow our business and continue to sustain strong trends.","Moving on to page 13, corporate and private equity, a total net loss of $6.5 billion for the quarter, but breaking it down into its constituent pieces, private equity generated net income of $242 million, reflecting gains on certain investments in our $9 billion portfolio. ","Treasury and CIO showed a net loss of around $200 million, but you\u2019ll see that the $261 million of negative NII this quarter is lower than the run rate seen over the last several quarters, which reflects the impact of higher rates, specifically higher yields quarter over quarter, driven by mortgages and reinvestment in munis.","In the quarter, we deployed $32 billion growth in new investments, primarily agency mortgages and munis, including $5 billion of agency mortgages, which we\u2019ve classified as held to maturity. As we continue to invest, if you follow the forward curve, you should expect NII to continue to improve the CIO\/Treasury over the next several quarters. ","And finally, although AOCI ended up relatively flat quarter over quarter or even up slightly, we did obviously see significant volatility during the quarter. The other corporate net loss of $6.5 billion is driven by the $9.2 billion pretax, or $7.2 billion after tax, for litigation expense in the quarter.","If you exclude litigation, results for the quarter did include a few positive tax adjustments totaling around $500 million relating to prior period adjustments, settlement resolutions, and reserve changes, mostly BAU items.","So finally, page 14 and our outlook. We\u2019ve covered most of the outlook going through the presentation, so just a couple of things I would highlight. As expected, our firm-wide NIM, core NIM, and NII were relatively flat this quarter, and given market rates, we expect relatively flat NIM and NII in the near term. The firm is positioned to benefit from a higher rate environment, and we are starting to see that in our results.","Turning to expenses, we expect adjusted expenses for the full year to be between $59.5 billion and $60 billion, as we continue to invest in controls and compliance. Overall, our businesses are delivering in terms of leadership growth and financial performance, with double digit growth in key businesses drivers as well as market share gains. And as I said, excluding corporate litigation and releases, we returned a 15% return on tangible common equity.","I\u2019ll hand it over to Jamie, who\u2019ll go through the final slides.","Jamie Dimon ","Great, Marianne. Thank you very much, and hello, everybody. So I\u2019m going to just talk a little bit about things on page 15, because a lot of questions we\u2019re getting asked about it. It\u2019s three columns. I\u2019ll do each one shortly.","First, simplifying our business. If you look at what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re spinning off One Equity Partners, selling physical commodities, and we\u2019ve closed down a bunch of business lines. I think it\u2019s a core business principle to always simplify your business and to focus on where you could really win. It\u2019s a little more amplified this time because obviously there\u2019s a new regulatory environment, capital, and we need to focus a lot of our management mindset on controls.","You also, on that first column, you\u2019ll see we\u2019re de-risking. We\u2019re trying to meet new standards that we\u2019ve set for ourselves and the regulators want us to set to reduce risk to our company, particularly on anti-money laundering. It will have a revenue effect, so my guess is, if you asked, probably a couple of hundred million dollars across all of our businesses. ","The middle column shows you the investments we\u2019re making in control. We want to be best in class. We want to get to Six Sigma. It\u2019s become the number one priority. Just to give you an idea, we\u2019re going to spend about $1 billion more. But that\u2019s not the effort. ","The real effort, if you think about it, is how much resources have been redirected to get this right. And there\u2019s unprecedented work streams, like 500 people working on CCAR, 500 people working on resolution and recovery. We just turned in a, believe it or not, 100,000-page plan. We\u2019ve added 5,000 people. And so this is a permanent investment. These costs are not going to go away. I think it\u2019s important we get this exactly right.","If you look at the right hand column, I just want to go down that one by one. As I just mentioned, it is permanent cost structure that will stay in place, but our overhead is very competitive. We\u2019re very rigorous on expenses. And we intend to stay that way. ","So you shouldn\u2019t expect to see tremendous increases in our expense base. While we simplified our business, it does not really affect our core businesses or core products. So Marianne went through the four business lines. It\u2019s not going to affect our ability to be extremely competitive. Our [unintelligible] balance sheet is intact, and as you know, critically important to us. ","The higher levels of capital liquidity will ultimately affect pricing to clients, but we\u2019ll also be able to push down and optimize across the globe, effectively, as we adjust to the new global financial architecture. I think it\u2019s important to point out that we do have to adjust to a new global financial architecture. It\u2019s not just the [unintelligible], it\u2019s really rules around the world. We\u2019re working hard to do that. We think we will be able to do that. But we go into that with excellent franchises, good underlying growth, and a pretty good long term outlook. ","Because while we operate in violent and volatile businesses around the world, markets go up and down, the underlying growth of asset management, equity, debt, capital markets, global multinationals, U.S. consumer needs, and middle market needs in the U.S., will actually be growing over time. So we think we\u2019re in a very good place to serve them. ","Our people really have done an outstanding job persevering and performing through these kind of difficult times, and you can actually go back, and it\u2019s been five or six years. If you came to this building, I know a lot of you have, you see the employee morale is very high, and hopefully it will stay there. ","And then the last thing, investor day, there\u2019s a lot of new rules, they won\u2019t be completely finalized, but we\u2019ll know most of them, we\u2019ll be able to give you a lot more of an update on how we think this affects our businesses going forward. We\u2019re pretty optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to continue to build a great company. ","So we\u2019ll stop there and open the floor to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Just on the legal front, not sure exactly what you can say. I\u2019ll give it a shot here. Does the lack of a settlement so far with the government reflect the DC shutdown, or more the fact that you\u2019re still negotiating, or a combination of both? Any comment there?","Jamie Dimon ","I think it may be a little bit the DC shutdown, but in reality it\u2019s a complex thing. It\u2019s a board-level issue, and we want a fair and reasonable settlement if we can. And that\u2019s all we can really say about it. It involves multiple agencies. So you can imagine the complexity. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And in terms of the $9 billion provision this quarter, can you give us any sense of how much that reflects revised estimates of government penalties and fines as opposed to refined estimates for damage claims from private parties and things like that?","Marianne Lake ","No, unfortunately we did as much as we can to give you as much clarity as we can, but we\u2019re not going to be able to break that down for you.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Could you give one more shot, Marianne, at explaining how the range of possible loss doesn\u2019t go down more after such a big provision?","Marianne Lake ","The way to think about it, very candidly, is that we didn\u2019t expect, when we estimated that\u2026 Remember, it\u2019s a very difficult thing to estimate the significant uncertainty in terms of the estimates, significant judgment, and when we made those judgments in the second quarter, we didn\u2019t anticipate the environment being as volatile and escalating to the point that it has now. ","So as we\u2019ve taken our reserves, the reserves reflect today. So they reflect the current environment and the situation and facts that we\u2019re in. And we\u2019ve now taken that into consideration as we look forward, with our reasonably possible range. That\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t gone down anywhere near dollar to dollar, obviously. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Does the settlement negotiations and things that you\u2019re doing, does that affect how you project losses on other aspects of legal that you were not negotiating in the last couple of weeks? Or you\u2019ve kind of upped the projection of what you might have faced on other stuff?","Marianne Lake ","All we can say is that we\u2019ve reserved for what\u2019s probable and estimable based upon the facts and circumstances specific to each individual exposure and the overall environment.","Jamie Dimon","It\u2019s a tough environment, John, and we\u2019re just trying to reflect that.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","On the expense front, I guess Jamie just said that the things that you\u2019ve added in the control and compliance area are permanent, and that kind of drove up the expense outlook on an adjusted basis, Marianne, of $59.5 billion to $60 billion? So is this kind of the go-forward run rate, the $60 billion adjusted expenses? What would be the opportunity to bring that down over time? Are there any areas where that is kind of still environmentally elevated? ","Marianne Lake ","Just two things. And I think in the Barclays presentation there was a slide that showed that of the increase in our outlook, there was a chunk of it that related to non-corporate litigation. So it certainly isn\u2019t entirely to do with our investment in cost and control, much of which we are funding through efficiencies. Having said that, there is an incremental cost. It is in part permanent, and is going to be affecting our run rate. But there was a good, I think, $500 million of other expenses including non-corporate litigation which, as you know, we don\u2019t adjust out. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then I guess also in there would be the default servicing, which is still elevated? Can you remind us the longer term target and how that could come down? ","Marianne Lake ","The longer-term target was a $325 million quarterly run rate, but that\u2019s over the longer term. What we said about 2013 and are on track to deliver is that we\u2019d exit the year with about $600 million of expenses in the fourth quarter. ","Jamie Dimon ","Which we still expect.","Marianne Lake ","Yes, which we still expect. If you look at the third quarter run rate adjusted, it\u2019s about $650 million, down from just over $700 million in the second quarter. So that trend is moving in the right direction.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then the last thing for me is just wondering, Jamie, does the internal control issues this year, some of the headline issues at regulators, does that affect your mindset as you go into CCAR and think about how you\u2019ll think about capital return next year?","Jamie Dimon ","First of all, we\u2019re going to get there when we get there. But obviously this company is very sound, plenty of capital. We want to pass CCAR, but when you talk about capital plans, it\u2019s going to be subject to several things. One is the stock price. Subject to passing CCAR with flying colors, which is really the stress test of CCAR, and also subject to wanting to meet our own targets for capital. So we\u2019ve already said we want to get to probably somewhere north of 10% Basel III tier one capital, etc. And when we know all those numbers, do our budgets, we\u2019ll put the proper CCAR plan in place. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Just a quick follow up on the CCAR. You didn\u2019t say the exact difference between advanced and standardized, but I wonder if you could shed light on the spread between the two. I\u2019m just curious, does it play a bigger role in the process this year? Or you were just kind of pointing it out?","Marianne Lake ","I was pointing it out mainly because I think if you go back several quarters over a year ago, standardized for us was lower than advanced by a reasonable spread. And clearly when the Collins [unintelligible] Amendment is applicable, which is not for a period of time, we would be looking at the lower of those two ratios. Right now, it\u2019s higher than the advanced approach by a little more than 10 basis points.","Jamie Dimon ","We should point out when we do CCAR next year, effectively - it\u2019s not the same for every quarter - it will be based on Basel III, which is a far more volatile number, because RWA moves around under stress with the Basel III as opposed to under Basel I.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Okay, but that spread is a lot tighter, so it\u2019s less concerning. So that\u2019s good. Curious, we don\u2019t have all the answers on how the whole leverage focus is going to shake out, but it seems to be working its way through a little bit. I think your book\u2019s down 15% or so year on year, and it\u2019s less than 10% of the overall ballot sheet. But is that a correct way to think about it, that that focus is going to start impacting the repo market? And I\u2019m just curious if you could talk about, for your book, what is balance sheet financing versus real customer financing.","Jamie Dimon ","Yeah, so SLR, which you\u2019re referring to, is at 4.7%. Remember, that would go up by 50 basis points if you just subtracted the cash we hold at central banks. So until the final rules come out, I wouldn\u2019t overreact to it. Obviously, SLR will cause you to optimize differently, and a lot of products, which are very high user capital under SLR, think of those as deposits, repo, anything that\u2019s short term and low margin. Revolvers, etc. ","So it will make you optimize differently, but I think in reality the way to look at it is we\u2019ll be able to adjust to it. We\u2019ll probably be able to do it by client. We\u2019re going to get to the ratio we need to get to, and we want to do it without disrupting all of our clients. So we\u2019ll be able to give you a lot more detail on that when we know the final rules. ","Marianne Lake ","And remember, there is still the possibility that there will be changes made to reflect, I think, the [FIN 41] [unintelligible] which you\u2019re talking about, which I think would be positive, clearly positive, to the repo market.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Shifting gears, just a quickie, I saw the guidance is for flat net interest income dollars. Your loan growth was 1% or 2% quarter on quarter, year on year. But the underlying business, as you mentioned, is a lot better. Just curious, it seems like conservative guidance, but curious on what\u2019s behind it.","Marianne Lake ","On NII?","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Correct. In terms of NII dollars being flat. ","Marianne Lake ","Growth has flattened out in terms of interest earning assets. You\u2019ve seen that obviously take place over the last couple of quarters. And so our guidance is reflecting the fact that we\u2019ve seen things stabilize, both NIM and NII, and that for the near term, that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Maybe a last one. It\u2019s a world that doesn\u2019t have a lot of loan growth, has very low interest rates, and capital markets have been far from ideal. To your point, your underlying businesses are operating good, and ex the charge, you\u2019re earning that $6 run rate that people are hoping you could get to. I guess the question is, do you have more confidence than you did last year in terms of that $24 billion over the cycle? Because you\u2019re kind of at that run rate now with not ideal conditions.","Jamie Dimon ","It\u2019s your job to forecast the future. We do think there\u2019s some very good businesses, and like I said, there\u2019s underlying growth. But obviously it could be swamped in the short run by markets and events, etc. We\u2019ll report a lot more on investor day, give you much more insight. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","All right. I have more confidence. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","A couple of questions. One, just another question on [FIC]. We\u2019ve talked in the past about clearing and clearing requirements. And prior quarters we just had very few trades coming in under the new rules. Can you give us a sense as to how customer behavior has been, and how that\u2019s impacted your [FIC] line this quarter?","Jamie Dimon ","I think there\u2019s two major things. First of all, the pre-trade and post-trade rules are in place, and I think basically they didn\u2019t have that much of an effect on the business. And now you have the [steps] in place, and if I\u2019m talking to folks on the trading floor, volumes seem to be down a little bit, but not because of the steps. The steps are basically accepting data at this point. They\u2019re not making markets yet. You haven\u2019t seen a huge effect of it. And I think over time, it still remains to be seen. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then on [SLR], did I hear you correctly that you\u2019re not going to make any changes to how you\u2019re providing credit to clients until you find out what the final rule is? There\u2019s no major changes on how you\u2019re approaching the market?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah, because we\u2019re going to meet the new targets, and retain the capital, and eventually, we are actually already pushing down to the business. We\u2019re starting to push down to the business units LCR, all the capital, all this stuff. Eventually, we\u2019ll put down SLR, and that will affect pricing and stuff. What we don\u2019t want to do is do a lot of it in anticipation. But if revolver [unintelligible] SLR at 100% drawn, the cost of those would go up. And I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll go up immediately, but they will go up over time. And so we\u2019ll be able to get there. We just don\u2019t want to do stupid things in anticipation of rules that we don\u2019t know what they are yet.","Marianne Lake ","Our businesses are thinking through all of the implications. When the rules come out, we\u2019ll be able to [unintelligible]. If you think about it, it\u2019s a measured approach. We don\u2019t want to overreact. We want to see how things play out. And at the margin, there will be some changes to products and pricing, but we\u2019re going to be very measured.","Jamie Dimon ","So cash at central banks doesn\u2019t have to hold capital against. That\u2019s 50 basis points. If you took revolvers down to what we say is a normal draw, like even a stress draw of 20%, which is what we kind of saw in the crisis, that would be another 50 basis points. So we just want to be a little measured in how we deal with this.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And the second thing, on mortgage, in the mortgage servicing, relatively high charges. The foreclosure piece in there. But just wondering if there\u2019s anything else going on in the servicing expenses?","Marianne Lake ","No, there\u2019s really just the basic underlying run rate, which is about $650 million. It does include some severance, obviously, given actions taken to adjust capacity in the business, together with the $200 million item, which relates to foreclosure matters. There\u2019s nothing else.  ","","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And portfolio sale coming up at all in that?","Marianne Lake ","No, not anything of any significance. We have done some, including recently, but nothing major.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And just lastly, just another question on the litigation, on the page two. I think the Street understands the reason for taking the $9 billion charge, and you\u2019ve got the two comments on page two, which highlight the unpredictable, hard to forecast, but I guess what some folks are wondering is, should we be putting into the model just a higher run rate of litigation expenses going forward? I think over the past couple of years it\u2019s been 300-500 kind of normalized quarter, one to two on a [unintelligible] and up quarter. Is that one to two the new normal until we get through this whole thing? ","Jamie Dimon ","We would love to reduce the uncertainty around this for ourselves and for you, but it\u2019s very, very hard to do. So the way I look at it is it will probably be elevated the next year or two, not like we just went through, but it will necessarily be lumpy. So as we settle, as we negotiate, as we figure out - remember there are multiple agencies involved in every case now. So you saw in the CIO thing, that we paid four and maybe eventually five penalties, which we really did not expect. And so we just have to deal with it and deal with the reality as it is. It will abate over time, and the underlying power of the company you can see. I wish I could give you a better answer, but one day it won\u2019t be a big number.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","So, Jamie, as you think about all the litigation stuff that you\u2019ve got, can you give us a sense as to how much you\u2019re currently in discussions to negotiate, to give us a sense of how far along you think you are?","Jamie Dimon ","First of all, the big ones are really board-level type of discussions. And our preference is always to resolve it. It is very hard to fight with your regulators or the federal government, but we want them to be fair and reasonable. We have shareholders. And those shareholders, by the way, I remind people, it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s veterans and retirees, and mothers, and we\u2019re trying to do the right thing. It\u2019s very hard. We\u2019ve got the top people involved inside and outside the company, and hopefully over time we will make this a much smaller issue. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Just looking at slide 15, I think this is very helpful in terms of laying out some of the things that you\u2019re targeting to reduce, on the left-hand side. I guess as we set back that picture and we think about a couple hundred million of revenue given up on the left side, and expense pick up in the middle, and then we factor in the higher capital requirements, the higher liquidity, are you confident that both the long term earnings impact won\u2019t be that meaningful and that you don\u2019t need to adjust the model that much? And I think that\u2019s kind of most people\u2019s view, but the nickels and dimes I think there\u2019s some concern that it does start to add up as well.","Jamie Dimon ","It does, but again, we think we\u2019ve maintained pretty good margins, and pretty good capital, and we have different ways to optimize. And not all the things we\u2019re simplifying were very profitable. And so remember, it lets us focus on other things. And the other things we\u2019re doing pretty well. Like, almost every single business we\u2019re up in share. ","And remember, the reason you go up in share is because\\you\u2019re doing a good job for clients. They vote with their feet, which means you\u2019re satisfying them. And so we\u2019re comfortable we\u2019ll be able to adjust to the new world and still have great businesses. ","And again, you haven\u2019t seen all the reprice that might take place, you haven\u2019t seen the reactions and changes in business strategies. And some things may move to the shadow banking world, which is fine. We\u2019ll figure it out. Like I mentioned, the needs of our clients, consumer, small business, middle market, large corporate, are not going away. They have to be served and satisfied somewhere. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And then just separately, the compensation rate within the investment bank coming down this quarter, just by pretty good revenue trends overall, any additional color on that? I think you\u2019ve been targeting 35% longer term, or maybe 31% or so.","Jamie Dimon ","We\u2019ve said 30-35%, and remember, we do it pretty consistently, after capital and looking at value creating and stuff like that. So that hasn\u2019t changed. It just came down a little bit this quarter. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And then lastly, could you just share what the CIO losses were a year ago? I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve disclosed that before.","Jamie Dimon ","We said they were modest losses last year.","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, modest. We didn\u2019t disclose it, Matt.","Jamie Dimon ","And they were about breakeven this quarter. It\u2019s getting very, very small.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America ","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","My first question is on the new leverage proposals. I think we\u2019re hearing loud and clear that you\u2019re not going to do anything rash in terms of how you run your businesses, but given that we\u2019re still in proposal form in the U.S., and also with Basel, can JPMorgan accelerate capital return in next year\u2019s CCAR, even with the proposals fluid on the leverage side?","Marianne Lake ","Two things. One is if you just look at the firm-wide leverage ratio for a second, that 4.7%, obviously there may be changes when the final rules are issued. But just take that as a base. We\u2019re only 30 basis points from the minimum, and while we\u2019re targeting to go higher than that, clearly 30 basis points is not a great distance for us to cover. ","And then I would just reiterate what Jamie said, which is when we look at our 2014 CCAR, it will take into account a balanced set of facts and circumstances. So obviously both the quantitative and qualitative nature of the results of the stress test, but also our desire to once again get to capital levels that we\u2019ve expressed, together with maintaining flexibility through appropriate dividends and repurchases. So all those things together will be considered in the capital plan.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And my second follow up question is on the advanced versus standardized approach, as it relates to the CCAR. You\u2019ve told us that the standardized ratio is clearly lower, but as you run your models under stress, what is more punitive for your bank? Is it coming into a stress scenario with a lower starting point on standardized? Or is it the RWA inflation when you stress the advanced?","Marianne Lake ","Three things. First of all, just to clarify, currently our standardized ratio is higher than advanced, albeit not by a very wide margin. So just to clarify that point. Just generically, the advanced approach RWA sensitivity to a stressed environment would be more impacted than a standardized approach. ","But remember that\u2019s a future issue for us, for 2014 CCAR. As we understand the instructions, we will be looking at an additional test on top of the 5% Basel I that will have a Basel I risk-weighted assets for the denominator for the first four quarters, and Basel III standardized for the second four quarters. ","So for 2014 CCAR, the advanced approach isn\u2019t one of the critical tests, although it will likely be in the future. But in theory, and in reality, that will reduce more dramatically under stress than the other measure. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Three small questions, and then one larger one. First, what was the loan utilization on the wholesale side for the quarter versus last quarter?","Marianne Lake ","It was relatively flat, in the low 30s, between 30% and 31%.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And as far as the headcount reduction, you said in CCB you\u2019re taking out 15,000 jobs this year, and 11,000 in mortgage. Where are the rest of the jobs coming out from, and how are you able to do that?","Marianne Lake ","It\u2019s consistent with what we said at investor day, in terms of the remaining jobs coming out of the branch network in consumer as we implement new technology and new operation models and new branch formats.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And as it relates to slide 15, the repositioning of the business, what inning are you in for that derisking and the control agenda? It seems like derisking might be earlier innings and the control agenda the later stages? But you tell me.","Jamie Dimon ","I guess we\u2019re making huge progress on it, but it\u2019s not going to stop for years. It\u2019s permanent.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And then the larger question relates to the legal issue. How much of the investor losses for the mortgage putback in the mortgage securities relates to Bear and Wamu? I know there\u2019s been a lot of numbers in the press, but we haven\u2019t heard those numbers from you.","Marianne Lake ","Just for what it\u2019s worth, on page 2, very small, in a footnote we talk about an estimate of about 80% of NBS deal losses related to heritage Wamu and Bear Sterns. That\u2019s losses. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Okay, 80% of losses. And what\u2019s the dollar amount of losses on the mortgage putback side?","Jamie Dimon ","When you say mortgage putback, are you talking about the GSE putback?","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","What\u2019s the total dollar amount of all the losses we\u2019re talking about for this potential settlement? That must be public somewhere. For mortgage putback, in aggregate, mortgage securities, what are the dollar amounts? What\u2019s the original principal amount and what\u2019s the investor loss? Just the dollar amounts, if you can break that down?","Jamie Dimon ","I think you have to get that from other analysts who actual have published numbers like that.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","So I guess one question, if 80% of the losses are from the deals, would you have done the deals differently? Did you not read the fine print? Did you not have some additional protection that you might have had? I know it was short notice for these transactions. On the other hand, as you look back now, maybe you wish you did something differently.","Jamie Dimon ","Obviously that\u2019s true, Mike, because this is very painful for the company. So Bear Sterns, we did do quickly. We didn\u2019t anticipate that we\u2019d be paying anything for prior losses for Bear Sterns. I tell people, even at Bear Sterns, remember I think it was $80 billion of bonds were made good, which would have failed that day had they gone bankrupt. ","And we did ask. We weren\u2019t completely stupid. We did ask the SEC and only the SEC for would they please agree not to take enforcement actions against JPMorgan for things that happened at Bear, which of course they couldn\u2019t do outright, but they did say they\u2019d take in consideration the circumstances in which the transaction took place. ","And in Wamu, we don\u2019t believe we\u2019re responsible, by contract. But that does not mean that people can\u2019t come after you. So that was a little bit of a lesson learned, too. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Can you talk more about the tradeoff, then? No one\u2019s forcing you to settle. If you really think this is a bad deal, then you obviously wouldn\u2019t do it. So what\u2019s the tradeoff for not settling versus settling?","Jamie Dimon ","We\u2019re going to do what\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders, all things considered. It\u2019s a board-level decision. It needs to be fair, reasonable, take into consideration all the facts, and if possible, we\u2019d like to get it done. And if we can\u2019t, the board will make that decision. It\u2019s not a good choice either way. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And your decision to disclose the legal reserve, as we go back and ask all the other banks, \u201cWhat\u2019s your legal reserve? JPMorgan disclosed it, why don\u2019t you?\u201d What were the factors that led you to do that?  ","","Marianne Lake ","","The factor there was candidly that you were all trying to do this. You had most, or at least a large number of, analysts that published research papers trying to recreate settlements and reserves through time, and for this one time only, we felt like it was helpful and transparent and constructive to show you the magnitude of reserves after these actions, so that you can have that context when you think about the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Just a couple of quick follow up questions. First of all, Marianne, in the expenses related to mortgage production, those were down about 6% quarter over quarter. Do you have a sense if the trajectory of those costs are going to come down faster over the next couple of quarters? Several banks have discussed that in terms of trying to reduce the expenses at the same time production revenues are also coming down.","Marianne Lake ","First of all, just to give context to that, 6-7% down quarter over quarter, there is a portion of our expense base related to mortgage that\u2019s truly variable. So as production levels go down, we pay less compensation on the loans. And as a result, that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in this quarter. With respect to then rightsizing the expense base for the opportunity in the market, we have taken actions, as you\u2019re aware, in the third quarter, to start to do that. ","However, once you\u2019ve gone beyond the truly variable costs, those actions take in some cases six months to truly get through the run rate. So while we will expect to see that start to come to fruition in the fourth quarter, not completely in the quarter, more as a run rate matter. ","And then there is a portion of costs that are more fixed in terms of our ability to be able to participate, whether it\u2019s real estate, technology, and a core infrastructure. Obviously we\u2019re also taking a look at that, but we\u2019re in this business, and so there will be an element of fixed costs obviously into next year. ","But you should expect that we\u2019re still seeing, absent [locks] go down tightly into the fourth quarter, you should expect revenues may be down, but expenses will also be down for that net slight negative pretax margin that we\u2019ve guided you to. That\u2019s still what we expect.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then just a question on pipelines. You mentioned that the pipeline in commercial banking was healthy. Just curious as to whether or not that is largely due to transactions that have been held up because of uncertainty in the economy, on the part of your borrowers, or is that also being helped by more business being booked by your bankers. And also, if you have a comment on the investment banking pipeline, at this point realizing it\u2019s early in the quarter, that would be helpful too.","Jamie Dimon ","So let me brag on our commercial bank and investment bank bankers. We\u2019ve opened up branches, I\u2019m going to say, Jacksonville, Sacramento, Nashville. So we\u2019re actually in more places in the commercial bank. ","Obviously we\u2019ve been building on the Wamu footprint in Florida and California, and they\u2019ve just been doing an exceptional job. And more importantly, a high quality job. We\u2019re really happy with the quality of the business they\u2019re booking and our investment bankers. You see the numbers in equity and debt. ","And we didn\u2019t mention all the deals we\u2019re involved in, but Verizon and Sprint and Nokia. There\u2019s good pipelines and good traffic. You know that can change tomorrow, but the fact is, we\u2019re satisfied with our clients, and we\u2019re thrilled with the business we\u2019re generating.  ","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then just Jamie, maybe a question on the buyback. At this point it doesn\u2019t sound like you have any concerns about the litigation expenses in this quarter being an issue for the CCAR submission or future buyback trends. Is that what I heard?","Marianne Lake ","We don\u2019t expect or believe that there should be any repercussions, but ultimately that\u2019s the regulators\u2019 decision. So we resubmitted CCAR in September. We\u2019re still waiting for feedback. We get feedback in early December. We will do a good, thoughtful, and appropriate job of thinking through our capital [asks] as we do the 2014 CCAR. So those will be the things that we do.","Jamie Dimon ","And we\u2019re doing very little stock buyback right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","You mentioned in passing that at the investor day in February you think that there will be a lot more of the rules in place that you\u2019ll be able to discuss the impact of. I was wondering the specific ones that you think will be available by then. Volcker, for example? Is it your understanding that you\u2019ll have a good understanding by then?","Jamie Dimon ","Yeah, Volcker, more detail on SLR.","Marianne Lake ","Long term debt.","Jamie Dimon ","Some more detail on how much long term debt. I think we have almost 20% of available resources today. And then you can look at things very basic, and simple, and say, okay, well, if cost is a little bit higher, and pricing stays the same, and capital is higher, returns are a little bit lower, that\u2019s true. But that doesn\u2019t take into consideration things we don\u2019t know, which is repricing, competitor strategies, and our ability to optimize by client, by state, by reason, by product. ","So all of those things, we just can give you a better idea. We\u2019re very comfortable. We\u2019ve got a very good business. We\u2019ll just give you a better idea of what we think it means, by business. You know, for example, we\u2019re going to allocate more capital and operating capital to the businesses. We\u2019re going to ask them to optimize on SLR. And without damaging the client franchise. So we\u2019ll just give you a little more detail, that\u2019s all.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Fair enough. One thing that you alluded to a couple of times this morning is the idea of the XLR being maybe 50 basis points higher if you didn\u2019t have to carry capital or count into the leverage exposure your deposits with central banks. Since you mentioned it a couple of times, does that mean that you actually have a reasonably high degree of comfort that there will be an exemption for that?","Jamie Dimon ","No, I think a lot of people mentioned that they think it was inappropriate to apply capital to that. But the regulators will decide. Whatever it is, we will be able to adjust to it and conform to the rules. I was just pointing out that some of these things can move that number quite a bit, as a reason why you shouldn\u2019t overreact to it and just take the time and do it right. ","When we know the final rules, we will conform. We can conform very quickly. So why would you conform very quickly and disrupt clients? So just think of it that way. We\u2019re just trying to do the right thing for the client base and the company. We could go out tomorrow and say, we\u2019re not going to make any more revolvers, and the revolvers [would go up] very quickly. We just don\u2019t want to do that. It\u2019s just not a rational way to run a business. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","At this year\u2019s investor day, you identified in the investment bank a $65 billion runoff portfolio that you gave some targets of reduction for at year end. I\u2019ve also noticed that in your pillar three disclosures you\u2019ve got a very high CRM, which I have to assume is associated with correlation book stuff, which I guess that runoff portfolio is. Can you give us a sense for whether that\u2019s right, and where you are with that runoff portfolio?","Jamie Dimon ","We are going to meet our target for the runoff portfolio, which are of course a couple of things. Part of the CRM was a synthetic credit portfolio, which is I\u2019m going to say a tenth of the size it was a year ago. I just don\u2019t remember the exact number. And we\u2019re still going to be optimizing across other products. There are certain things in mortgages which use up a lot of capital, etc. So we have more to go in kind of optimizing RWA.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And that was a separate synthetic credit portfolios than what you moved over from CIO, or is this part of it?","Jamie Dimon ","No, that one. But they had a small correlation book in the IB. This is a synthetic credit portfolio that was moved over to the IB, and eventually those will probably be put together, and much smaller.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","We heard recently from some people in the industry that there\u2019s the expectation of a major counterparty default as part of the CCAR stress test this year. Are you hearing that that\u2019s going to be part of it?","Jamie Dimon ","Yes.","Marianne Lake ","Yes, we\u2019ve received instructions, and that\u2019s a feature.","Jamie Dimon ","It\u2019s a rational, idiosyncratic event that people should be prepared for. Remember, we did go through that with Lehman.","Marianne Lake ","And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve modeled such an event as part of our stress testing.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Okay, final question, it\u2019s always been very important to you, Jamie, that you have a record of not losing money in a quarter through the whole credit bubble and disaster, and yet this quarter, because of the size of the litigation reserve, you did. Not a large amount of money, but you actually had a net operating loss. Do we take that as a signal of the certainty and the timing of sort of the size of the settlement?","Jamie Dimon ","No. I mean, obviously it\u2019s very painful, for me, personally, because I agree with you, I don\u2019t like losing money, obviously, for my shareholders. We put up, and Marianne\u2019s been very clear, these are very tough numbers to estimate. It\u2019s a heightened environment, multiple agencies are involved on often the same thing. We\u2019re just trying to improve and get better and move on. Remember, these reserves relate to things that took place over multiple years. So it isn\u2019t a one-year event. And we still didn\u2019t lose money during the crisis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","Marianne, you had mentioned the CCAR resubmission. When that comes out, will that be made public? And what will we kind of be able to get from that, and how will that impact your submission going forward?","Marianne Lake ","I\u2019m not expecting that the details and results will necessarily become public. Remember, it wasn\u2019t a quantitative issue, per se, it was a qualitative issue. So what the regulators are looking for is our response to their recommendations and substantial progress in that. I do think it obviously would be public what their response has been to that, sometime in December, and we\u2019ll work out exactly when that would be. So I would expect you to understand whether our plan has been accepted or otherwise at some point in December. ","And we\u2019re already working on the 2014 CCAR submission. Obviously that submission in early January means that it will be board approved in December, and that process has started. And all of the work - Jamie talked about it. He talked about 500 people, thousands of people involved, models, documentation, [covenants], controls. All of that work that we did for the resubmission is fully being leveraged for ongoing CCAR processes, and we\u2019re building on it. So this for us will continue to become better over time, and 2014 will be another step in that process. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","And as far as other changes that you\u2019re aware of, you had mentioned the counterparty failure, are there any other kind of large items that would be a change in the way, or in addition to the way, they\u2019re approaching the submissions this year?","Marianne Lake ","Really, most significantly the other thing that we just talked about, which is that in addition to all of the other minimum levels that we\u2019ve been testing against, we have new tests under Basel III. It will be a test that recognizes phase-ins in the capital numerator, and also a slightly different denominator through time with different minimum levels of 4% in \u201914 and 4.5% in \u201915. So that\u2019s the other real big [frame up] change.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","And then related to the taking of the charge in this period, what was the actual information that changed? In other words, the accounting rules tend to require a certain standard to recognize that, and if you haven\u2019t reached that agreement yet, what actually did change that required the recognition of that in Q3?","Marianne Lake ","We obviously can\u2019t comment on any sort of discussion or status of any specifics on litigation. Yes, you\u2019re right, the framework is probably estimable, so you should obviously assume that we didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t estimate, or these events were not probable at the time. But today, our reserves are appropriate for the current environment and the information that [unintelligible].","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","And did you say at the outset that the $9 billion wasn\u2019t fully taxed because a portion related to penalties? That would imply roughly about a third of it. Does that make sense?","Marianne Lake ","We\u2019re estimating some penalties. Given the environment, we would expect that some of the expenses would come with penalty nature, and you can obviously do the math from the front page. But they are estimates, and they include a range of matters, not limited to mortgage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Can you guys talk about the commercial loan balances? I noticed that the period end balances had a nice increase from the third quarter, but your averages were almost flat. Is there a pickup in lending activity in the month of September?","Marianne Lake ","Actually, it\u2019s a great question. There is a fronting in that number of just shy of $2 billion, $1.7 billion, that will ultimately be syndicated in the short term. So I would adjust that out when you\u2019re looking at the quarter over quarter numbers. Other than that, it\u2019s relatively flat and steady performance in core middle market and strength in real estate.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And I know the litigation questions are sensitive, so I don\u2019t know if you can answer this or not. The discussion that are going on that we\u2019re reading out in the paper with the U.S. government, is it more of a factor of the dollar amounts that\u2019s holding it up, or is it more in terms of conditions?","Marianne Lake ","We can\u2019t comment.","Jamie Dimon ","We\u2019ve already said all we can say about that.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Another question is you guys, at your investor day, talked about the Visa partnership that you just announced. Could you give us some more color on how that\u2019s going, with the merge [and acquiring] and the payments business?","Jamie Dimon ","It\u2019s going well, but as [unintelligible] is still building the systems to actually do it, and come up with the products and services that we think can do a better job both for the merchants and for customers. We\u2019re still working on that. That\u2019s not going to happen overnight. We just think it could be a very good thing over time.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","I assume you\u2019ll give us a good update at the investor day in February, then?","Jamie Dimon ","Yes. We\u2019ll try.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Coming back to the asset deals, you talked about the deposit margins improving quarter to quarter earlier in your call, are we at a point where the asset yields in the securities portfolio have bottomed? Are you replacing securities with securities with equal yields or higher? ","Jamie Dimon ","Essentially it\u2019s flattened out at this point, yeah.","Marianne Lake ","And we\u2019ve begun to reinvest. We\u2019re looking at the over portfolio. We\u2019re doing some rotation. And that process has started.","Jamie Dimon ","And remember, rates did go up almost 100 basis points.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Finally, on a go forward basis, once we get over all these issues that everybody\u2019s confronting today in the banking industry, with the regulatory and maybe the interest rate environment, what\u2019s going to be the capital ratio that\u2019s going to constrain your growth? Is it going to be the SLR ratio, the tier one common? What\u2019s the one you think will be the real Achilles\u2019 heel? ","Marianne Lake ","At a macro level, just talking about the firm-wide level for a second, we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re looking at running the firm at a Basel III tier one common ratio of between 10% and 10.5%, which would imply in any case tier one capital minimums will be 11% ultimately. So we\u2019ll be at 11-plus percent in tier one capital. ","And we talked about leverage running at 5.5% over time as well. And if you think about 11%-plus tier one capital, 10.5% Basel III common, and a 5.5% documentary leverage ratio, given the ratio of our risk-weighted assets to our balance sheet, they actually can exist quite happily. ","So it is going to be a multi-variant set of binding constraints, but at those levels they exist quite nicely. Obviously the devil\u2019s in the detail, when you push down into the businesses client by client, product by product, and that work will go on. And as we do that work, as Jamie\u2019s talked about, we expect to be able to optimize, which will include some repricing and some restructuring of products, but at a macro-level, they will coexist relatively well.","Jamie Dimon ","I would just add to that, CCAR will be, in our opinion, also another binding constraint over time.","Marianne Lake ","Very good point.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And I guess coming back to the capital, on the orderly liquidation authority, as we all know, there\u2019s certain buckets of capital that have to be maintained. Do you have any clarity yet that the excess over the 9.5% over the tier one common portion, will that be applicable to the other buckets, so you don\u2019t have to maybe raise as much in preferred or senior debt? ","Jamie Dimon ","We don\u2019t know those rules yet, but presumably it\u2019s going to be equity plus preferred plus unsecured senior debt, and subordinated debt. And I think our number\u2019s already at 20% of risk-weighted assets there. So we\u2019re already in a pretty good place, but we\u2019ll see what the final rules are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Harte of Sandler O\u2019Neill. ","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O\u2019Neill ","Most things have been covered, but I\u2019m looking at the loan loss reserve releases from the PCI portfolio. Assuming credit gets better, that theory continues as well. How should we think of that going forward? Is that going to be something lumpy from time to time? Is it going to be more kind of gradual, like it would be on a normal loan portfolio?","","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019ve got to go, because I have a meeting I have to go to, but I appreciate the time with us. And Marianne can answer the remaining questions.","Marianne Lake ","Sure. The way to think about the PCI reserve release, it\u2019s the first one we\u2019ve taken, and it reflects obviously improved home prices and lower severities. But it\u2019s a life of loan model, so if all of the things from here are equal, then, you know, we are where we are. Obviously if there are significant changes, probably primarily in home prices, but also in delinquencies, then you might see some more reserve releases. These are likely to be more periodic and lumpy, because obviously we will be refreshing our life of loan forecast over time. It\u2019s possible that you may see them in multiple courses, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re expecting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derek De Vries of UBS. ","Derek De Vries - UBS","I\u2019ve just got a few questions on the investment bank. And you touched on the comp expense earlier. It was obviously very low as a percent of revenues. Excluding DVA I think it was 27%. So given revenues are down, your bonus accrual must be way down. And my question becomes, is that just coincidence that it happens in a quarter where you take a $9 billion of regulatory litigation costs, or is there kind of a cause and effect there?","Marianne Lake ","No, there\u2019s no cause and effect there.","Derek De Vries - UBS ","And then my second question, you\u2019ve talked a lot during this conference call about sort of pushing things out to clients when you have more clarity on your leverage ratio, and the rules and what not. I guess just broader, as you think back, not to the leverage ratio but all the Basel III rules we\u2019ve faced, and all the changes and higher capital requirements and whatnot, are you surprised at how slowly some of those price increases have been pushed down, and how slowly capacity has left the industry? Or do you think it\u2019s about right? Or do you think we\u2019ll see more of that going forward? Maybe you could just make some broad comments there.","Marianne Lake ","I can certainly talk [unintelligible] where as soon as we understand the rules we start to push them down into the organization so that the people who are transacting at the product and client level can make the best and most appropriate decisions to maximize returns and meet hurdles and all of those sorts of good things. ","And you\u2019re right, over the last several years, we have seen capital and liquidity increase dramatically. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve still been delivering a core underlying performance in that kind of mid-teens return on tangible common equity. So we\u2019re still competing effectively, which leads me to believe that others are doing the same thing and that that\u2019s being reflected in the competitive nature of the environment.","I think it\u2019s obviously going to continue some, as we and others have set ourselves even higher targets for capital, and then obviously new rules, including the SLR. But I also do think that these things work through the system through time pretty quickly, given the nature of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","One quick follow up on your liquidity holdings. Your excess liquidity pool looks like it increased almost $85 billion sequentially to $538 billion. Just want to know what\u2019s driving that, if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re worried about or thinking about, because I thought your LCR ratio last quarter was above 100%. And if you could just give us your updated LCR ratio, that would be great.","Marianne Lake ","Our LCR ratio last quarter was 118%. This quarter we haven\u2019t disclosed it, but it\u2019s not far off that same level. And the increase in cash is not necessarily because we\u2019re trying to do anything from a liquidity perspective, but also reflects inflows from clients, both operating builds, and importantly noncore, nonoperating deposits that we then place with the central banks.  ","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Marianne Lake ","Thank you. "],"12106":["JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through with the presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","So if you turn to Page 1, a very strong start to the year with record net income of $6.5 billion for the first quarter and record EPS of $1.59 a share, on revenue of $25.8 billion and a return on tangible common equity of 17% for the quarter.","You can see on Page 1, we\u2019ve highlighted upfront two significant items; a $650 million reserve release in mortgage and $500 million reserve release in card. And as I go through the presentation, I\u2019ll also be highlighting for you a number of smaller items some positive and some negatives.","We continue to maintain the leadership positions we highlighted at Investor Day; Number One ATM Network, Number Two Branch Network, Number Two Mortgage Originator, Number One Credit Card Issuer in the U.S., and Number One ranking in Global IBCs. And we\u2019re on track to deliver against our expense targets for the year.","On a reported basis, total loans for the company were up 1% with core loan growth, excluding run-off up 5%. Favorable credit performance continued in our wholesale and core consumer portfolios with low levels of delinquencies and charge-offs. As the housing market recovers, losses in the real estate portfolio continue to improve and this quarter, we saw 30+ delinquency decline by 14%, and severities improve.","So if you turn to Page 3 for a brief capital update, we ended the quarter with Basel I and Basel III Tier I common of $143 billion and $146 billion respectively, both up from last quarter. Our Basel I ratio is 10.2%, which reflects the impact of new market risk rules that went into effect in January and the 10.2% compares to a ratio of 9.9% the last quarter as measured on the same basis.","Our Basel III ratio of 8.9% is up from 8.7% last quarter and reflects the full impact of the rules (we understand them) [ph]. And as you know, we don\u2019t put forward the impact of passive run-off or model-enhancements, which we expect to deliver around 100 basis points of benefit this year and next.","And we still expect to reach our Basel III Tier 1 common target of 9.5% by the end of this year, including the capacity to continue share repurchases. And we\u2019ve also made progress this quarter and are on track for full LCR compliance this year. So in the bullet to the bottom of the page, the Board intends to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.38 a share effective in the second quarter and we repurchased $2.6 billion of common equity in the first quarter with authorization to repurchase an additional $6 billion over the next four quarters.","Returning to the businesses, on Page 4, we have Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.6 billion of revenue with an ROE of 23% on new allocated capital. And as we go through the presentation, all of the current quarter ROEs are calculated based upon the new allocated capital numbers that we showed you at Investor Day.","Overall, revenue was down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter driven by mortgage banking, quarter-on-quarter the reduction reflects the continuation of production margin compression. Credit costs reflect the releases in both mortgage banking and card that we referred to on Page 1.","And core expenses were flattish both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter normalizing prior periods. We remain on track to deliver on our expense guidance and head count in the consumer bank and mortgage business was down over 3,000 heads this quarter, a function of the evolution in the branch operating model and the completion of the IFR work. We ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches and closed 19,000 ATMs and as of today, we have over 1,400 Chase Private Client locations.","On Page 5, Consumer & Business Banking, net income was $641 million and an ROE of 24% on net revenue of $4.2 billion down 2% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline is due to fewer days in the quarter for net interest income and seasonality in non-interest revenue.","We continue to see pressure on deposit margins, eight basis points down in the quarter and 32 basis points year-over-year, but this continues to be largely offset by the (inaudible) growth of 11% year-over-year, which we believe is significantly faster than the industry. And this quarter we had the lowest customer attrition on record, which reflects the great progress that we are making on the customer experience.","And we were just named winner of four TNS Choice Awards recognizing superior performance in customer acquisition, retention, satisfaction and market share with consumer and affluent banking customers, which is more than any financial institution has earned in any year.","Average Business Banking loan balances of $18.7 billion are flattish quarter-over-quarter and in the drivers you can see loan production decrease this quarter, due to softer demand and higher competitive intensity. However, the pipeline in the second quarter is looking stronger.","We had record investment sales of over $9 billion, up 40% year-on-year and client investment assets are up 15%, which shows that we are penetrating our customers more deeply with 70% of those sales up from 50% last year being managed money driving strong recurring revenues.","Finally, on this page expenses are up year-over-year, reflecting the investments that we are making in the business, including new branch builds, and a one-time cost related to a contract renegotiation.","Turning to Page 6 on Mortgage Banking, overall net income of $673 million and an ROE of 14%, and if you look at the top of the table in the first blue highlighted items, production pretax income was $427 million, down year-over-year and sequentially driven by continued margin compression.","As we expected and as we talked about last quarter, gain on sale margins continue to come down this quarter and reached levels of around 100 basis points on a pretax basis, which compares to a normalized pretax margin in the fourth quarter of last year of around 180 basis points and was driven by a significant tightening in primary and secondary spreads, as well as pricing pressure, reflecting increased capacity in the market.","Strong originations of $53 billion were up 37% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. While applications were actually down 8% from last quarter, but we continue to expect high levels of refinancing and close loan volumes in the next quarter to remain solid.","Production expense increased year-on-year on higher volumes, a net repurchase of this of $81 million in the quarter reflects a reduction in realized losses, partially offset by reserve releases. We continue to believe we\u2019re adequately reserved and we do expect reserve releases to broadly offset losses over time.","Moving down to servicing, revenue of $778 million increased sequentially, primarily due to one time gains associated with buying, sharing and reselling certain delinquent loans out of securities. Servicing expenses of $737 million increased a small amount of final IFR cost as we round down in every quarter and also from severance; and if you back those costs out, servicing expenses were slightly lower than the $725 million normalized run rate we talked about last quarter. IFR costs are now out of our run rate and we continue to expect servicing costs to reduce to $600 million by the fourth quarter of this year.","MSR risk management was a modest loss, a $142 million. The driver of the net loss is an increase in our expectations for home price appreciation this year, which is a great thing, but drove an approximate negative $400 million within the model update line in the supplements given higher prepayments.","And although there is an upfront negative in the mark of servicing assets, improvements in home prices would drive lower credit losses over time that will more than outlay this mark.","Finally on this page, Real Estate Portfolios show pretax income of $784 million, which includes net charge-offs of around $450 million this quarter, and compares to a normalized fourth-quarter number of $520 million. This reflects lower delinquencies as well as lower severities as home prices improve and lead us to a release reserve of $650 million this quarter.","As you\u2019ve seen charge-off has been steadily declining and we do expect that to continue, but at a more moderated pace. We\u2019ve updated our guidance for you to expect quarterly net charge-offs to be at or below $400 million.","If you turn to Page 7, Card Merchant Services & Auto, net income of $1.3 million, up 8% year-on-year or up 33% if you exclude the change in loan loss reserve and ROE of 33%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was flat year-on-year, but down quarter-on-quarter with quarter one having seasonally lower loan balances, sales volume and merchant processing volume. Expenses were down by year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by non-core expense items in the comparable period.","Net charge-offs continue to be low and we released $500 million of loan loss reserve this quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in early stage rollouts. The net charge-off rate is 3.55%, well down over 80 basis points year-over-year was up slightly quarter-on-quarter on lower loan balances. And consistent with Investor Day, you should expect up to $1 billion of card reserve releases in the full year of 2013, including the $500 million reflected this quarter.","Year-on-year growth in sales volume was strong at 9%, and the revenue rates at 12.83% reflects strong interchange revenue and merchant processing fees, with merchant processing volumes up 15% year-on-year.","Moving onto Auto, originations were up 12% year-on-year and 18% quarter-on-quarter. Although the first quarter is seasonally stronger, this growth outpaced the normal seasonal pattern. We gained share in the quarter through increased competitive positioning in prime and auto saw a strong growth with our private label manufacturing partners.","Moving onto Slide 8 and 9 on the Corporate & Investment Bank; very strong first quarter results, and the results this quarter included a small DVA gain of $126 million that is a loss in the same quarter of last year of $900 million. Both of which you\u2019ll see in the credit adjustment line item in the table. So if you focus on the numbers excluding DVA, $2.5 billion of net income on $10 billion of revenue, down 2% year-on-year, but up 22% quarter-on-quarter, and with an ROE of 18%.","Total Banking revenue was $3 billion, up 12% year-on-year driven by higher IB fees of $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year with record bond underwriting. And lending related revenue were $500 million, primarily core NII and fees on retained lending commitment and to a lesser extent gains on positions received in loan restructuring.","Total Markets & Investor Services revenue of $7 billion, down 7% year-on-year driven by fixed income market of $4.8 billion, down 5% year-on-year, coming off of a very strong first quarter last year, and up 50% quarter-on-quarter on seasonality with continued strength in the client franchise. The P&L impact from the remaining synthetic credit portfolio included there was insignificant this quarter, but positive.","Equity markets of $1.3 billion, down 6% year-on-year, but up 50% quarter-on-quarter and the sequential change reflects seasonally strong equity derivatives results. Securities Services revenue of $974 million was flat year-on-year, and down slightly quarter-on-quarter. And while a portion of this reflects the depository receipts business, which is seasonally down, the portion that reflect our custody business has grown in line with assets under custody, which were $19.3 trillion, up 8% year-on-year.","And we\u2019re seeing positive expense trends. Year-on-year a net reduction of 2% driven by lower compensation and efficiency initiatives essentially substantially offset this quarter by litigation expenses. If you take the DVA and the restructuring gains I mentioned, as well as the litigation expense they net out.","The comp\/revenue ratio at DVA of 34% is in line with our guidance, and at the bottom of the drivers section, you can see that our average CIB VaR continued to decline this quarter to $62 million, reflecting lower levels of risk including the continued de-risking of the synthetic credit portfolio, but also reflecting very lower levels of volatility across multiple asset classes.","So on Page 9, before I step over the page, you can see that we continue to make progress, growing our international loans and deposits. Our international loan balances were up 9% since the end of 2012 with particular strength across Asia and EMEA.","Moving on to Page 10, in the Commercial Bank; we\u2019ve posted our net income of nearly $600 million on $1.7 billion of revenue flat year-over-year with a return on equity of 18%. Underlying loan growth of $0.11 year-on-year includes our C&I portfolio, which grew 12% in line with the industry, and our commercial real estate book, which grew 10% year-over-year significantly above the industry, driven by commercial term lending.","Quarter-over-quarter loan balances were generally flat consistent with the industry, partly reflecting the fact that some demand were pulled forward into the fourth quarter, but also reflecting lower level of demand and increased competition. Loan spreads held up, while this quarter remained stable to last quarter, and credit quality continued to be very strong. Lastly here, expenses up 8% year-on-year on the continued investment in the business and increased operating expenses to commercial card.","Turning to Page 11, our Asset Management business have record net income for first quarter of $487 million, up 26% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter with an ROE of 22%. 12% year-on-year revenue growth reflect an increase in management fees driven by strong long term net inflows including a record $31 billion this quarter marking the 16th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows.","We also had higher equity and fixed-income markets, up 9% based on our business mix, and still higher performance fees driven by strong fund returns in 2012. We have record loan balances up over $20 billion, driven by increases in U.S. mortgage and international loan growth.","Total AUM was close to $1.5 trillion with over $1 trillion in long-term AUM. And lastly, higher head count expenses and performance related fund contributed to a 9% year-over-year expense growth, while the pretax margin of 29% also increased from 26% last year reflecting an improvement in operating leverage.","Moving on to Page 12, Corporate and Private Equity; total net income of $260 million for the quarter and reflected a private equity net loss of $182 million including nearly $300 million of unrealized losses related to specific positions.","Treasury and CIO net income were $24 million, and included about $500 million of net securities gains offset by about $470 million of Negative NII due to low rates and limited reinvestment opportunities. Both the private equity losses and the securities gains were more significant this quarter than usual unless it\u2019s a positive $200 million pretax.","Finally, other corporate net income of just over $400 million includes $230 million of prior period tax adjustments. And finishing on guidance in CIO and Treasury, our guidance remains a net loss of $300 million plus or minus, and in other corporate, our guidance remains $100 million plus or minus of net income with both numbers able to vary quarter-on-quarter.","Turning to Page 13 on net interest margin, Firmwide NIM declined 3 basis points and Core NIM 2 basis points quarter-on-quarter. A number of items affected our NIM first were negative. The low rates environment continues to affect our reinvestment opportunities, and also competitive pressures continued to impact loan yields.","On the positive side, investment securities yields increased from higher mortgage backed securities income driven by slower prepayments and reduced secured financing. And lower long term debt cost reflected a change in mix.","Lastly, our outlook on Page 14, we\u2019ve covered most of these items already, but you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve changed our NIM and NII guidance to put it altogether on one place, and on a consistent basis.","All numbers shown are pretax and our estimates of net NII reflecting both rate compression and volume growth. So you should expect modest NIM compression during the year with absolute levels of NII very strongly supported by growth in interest earning assets, but overall NII expected to be down about 1% this year.","Lastly, you may have seen, we will redeem about $5 billion of outstanding trust preferred in the second quarter, and as it heads up, this will lead to a modest one-time loss in the second quarter, but also a lower cost of debt over time.","Backing up, we had a record quarter with high quality earnings and strong underlying business performance seeing positive momentum across our businesses.","So thank you for joining us. Operator, you can open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","James Dimon","Operator?","Operator","Our first question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.","Marianne Lake","Hi, John.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Good morning, Marianne. On the last point about NII outlook, what are the drivers of the strong growth in earning\u2026?","Marianne Lake","Sorry, John, we can\u2019t hear you. Apologies John, we didn\u2019t hear the question.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Can you hear me?","Marianne Lake","","Yes, we can.","James Dimon","Yes.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Sorry about that. Can you tell me on the NII outlook, what are the drivers of the strong growth in earning assets you expect that you just mentioned on the NII page?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So we are growing \u2013 as you\u2019ve probably seen on Investor Day and while there was a little bit of lower growth this quarter, we do expect to grow loans in our commercial bank loans and asset management, wholesale loans, mortgage banking. So we are growing our deposit very strongly. So it\u2019s really just the underlying business driver growth that we\u2019ve been seeing and expect to continue.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay. On the expense outlook, you mentioned so the kind of adjusted expenses to be down about a $1 billion, what\u2019s the base that we should look at for you to be down from, do you have that?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. So John, if I refer you back and from recollection I\u2019ll do it for you, if I refer you back to Investor Day, it\u2019s based upon our adjusted expenses, which are defined as our expenses excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters, which in 2012 was $60 billion plus or minus, I think $60.1 billion and we\u2019re expecting to be $59 billion this year and that\u2019s what we\u2019re on track to deliver.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","And what was it in the first quarter?","James Dimon","A little higher than that.","Marianne Lake","A little higher than that in the first quarter. But the first quarter is seasonally high.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Yeah. Okay, got it. And then can you just repeat your outlook on the default servicing expense line that came down a lot this quarter nicely and you mentioned the target for the end of the year?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So the fourth quarter normalized run rate was $725 million and this quarter it\u2019s down a little of that as you would expect given the IFR completion. We said that we expected the fourth quarter to be running at $600 million we said that at our Investor Day and we\u2019re still on track to do that. And we\u2019ve also said that the long-term run rate for that part of the business would be about $325 million a quarter and that will be over the next couple of years.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay. And then the litigation dropped significantly this quarter, you said I think you said it was kind of immaterial this quarter on the litigation provision, is that right?","Marianne Lake","The litigation dropped quarter-over-quarter, clearly we had a large number last quarter on the back of IFR and we did have a litigation expenses this quarter, you will see in the supplement that was just over $300 million.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay. And the last thing is on the buybacks, you did a healthy buyback this quarter, but the share count didn\u2019t shrink that much. Is the first quarter heavier than usual in terms of your issuance? And the question is getting at, would $2.6 billion of buybacks in other quarters be expected to shrink the share count in quarters when I thought the first quarter?","Marianne Lake","Yes, that\u2019s right John.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay. So your issuance is more weighted towards the first, is that right?","Marianne Lake","Yes, but also remember we didn\u2019t buy back shares in the fourth quarter or third quarter. So that was an overall, overall net $2.6 billion \u2013 $2.6 billion net of employee issuance.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","I was getting at how that translates to reduction in the share count, it\u2019s kind of offset by what you do on issuance right, each quarter?","Marianne Lake","Yes.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","And it was just a normal quarter of issuance, so $2.6 billion buyback would keep the share count flat. Is that the kind of ratio we might expect?","James Dimon","I think the issuance number is fairly level and consistent quarter-by-quarter because it is really based upon amortization of restricted stock and all that.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay. Okay.","James Dimon","And the buyback, the $2.6 billion, that was over the course of the quarter. So it averaged out to half of that through the quarter. So we can give you more detail on that little bit later John.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, but it\u2019s steady throughout the year, that\u2019s what I was getting at.","James Dimon","The $6 billion will offset how much average amortization over the same 12 month period like $2 billion\u2026","Marianne Lake","$2 billion.","James Dimon","$2 billion, okay.","Marianne Lake","Actually John, that\u2019s a good way of looking at it. The $6 billion we\u2019ve authorized to repurchase relates to employee issuance at the same period just a little bit over $2 billion.","James Dimon","For accounting purposes.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","$2 billion for the year and $6 billion for the year. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Nomura.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities (US)","Hi guys, thanks.","Marianne Lake","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities (US)","Hello there. First of all, the first deadline for compliance with central clearing came and went and it clearly didn\u2019t have much of an impact on your first quarter FICC results. So I am curious I hear commentary in the market that a lot of clients might not be ready for either the second or the third deadlines later this year. Curious what you are expecting and if you do think it could produce any hiccup in activity levels.","James Dimon","The second one is the big one. That\u2019s June 11\u2026","Marianne Lake","June 11, yeah.","James Dimon","\u2026something like that, and that\u2019s where you have a lot of asset manager, a lot of bigger client stuff like that. People are still getting use to it, so we think \u2013 I think we\u2019ve got 30% or 40% lined up to do it.","Marianne Lake","Yes.","James Dimon","They are still reading documents, sign new documents and so hopefully they will go smoothly. It\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll go smooth in the first round. The first round is really, really large participants and swap deals et cetera. So we\u2019ll have to just wait and see.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities (US)","And even on the wait and see if some aren\u2019t ready, do you think of that as a temporary and just literally a function of processing not maybe we don\u2019t need insurance anymore because it\u2019s too expensive?","James Dimon","Look I don\u2019t, we really don\u2019t know, I would say temporary, but probably still down a little bit, because of the reason you gave. Some people just say we don\u2019t need to do this anymore, and we also know all the final rules by the way, and how the SEFs are going to work in bidding.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities (US)","Right. Okay. Marianne, on the RWA front, bunch of little things in here, but Basel I RWAs were up an 11% quarter-on-quarter, but Basel III were pretty much flat. I know that it\u2019s something to do with 2.5% being starting in the first quarter, but if you can help us.","Marianne Lake","Yeah, so if you take our Basel I RWA went up about couple of hundred billion dollars that\u2019s all about the implementation of the new market risk rules and Basel 2.5, which is also why you saw our ratio go down from reported 11% last quarter. So it\u2019s really all explained by that, and our Basel III RWA was flattish quarter-over-quarter with some pluses and some minuses.","James Dimon","And that was already in there essentially.","Marianne Lake","Yeah, of course.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities (US)","So I guess that leads into the comment you made towards the beginning on any passive runoff and model enhancements are not pulled forward in your results and I think you said it could be a about 100 basis points. Is there a dollar amount of RWA natural runoff that we should be thinking about, because obviously capital is building?","Marianne Lake","Yes, from recollection. And again Glenn \u2013 forgive me if I get it wrong, it\u2019s on the slides on the firm overview in Investor Day that I think that a 100 basis points equates to about $180 billion of RWA over the next two years. But remember the passive runoff will take place over time; not completely linearly but over time and the model enhancements can be a little bit lumpier and a little bit more back ended. So we\u2019ll just have to see how that pays out. But, yes, we\u2019re still expecting for those things to happen for us to get 100 basis points of benefit from that and that\u2019s without the active mitigation, that\u2019s going to happen over the course of time.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities (US)","Okay, last one\u2026","","Marianne Lake","Just check that slide for me Glenn when you get on.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities (US)","Will do. Last one Jamie, I know you addressed some of this in your shareholder letter but between everything related to Basel III stress-test, Dodd-Frank in place already and then OLA and Living Wills coming online, it feels like we\u2019re going down to pass on containing to big sale but yet there is a steady drum beat including grounds that are to change things. Just curious on where we\u2019re headed in this and what will stop the drum beat? When is enough-enough?","James Dimon","Well, Glenn, I actually think you all on the line should be dealing with this issue a little bit because the reason you have companies is because they serve clients well at a good cost, There is a reason our numbers are good because we have cross-selling clients come to us and there are reasons for global banks just like there are reasons for community banks. I think that the real issue again, you guys do the numbers is the banking system has gotten so much stronger in the United States and it\u2019s not just capital but it capital, liquidity, oversight, sort of activities that people didn\u2019t like, [no longer] [ph] being done, derivatives going to clearing houses and the initial wave of OLA and Living Wills et cetera, those things should all work. I hope at one point we declare victory and just stop eating our young at this time.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura Securities (US)","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","James Dimon","","Hi.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","A couple of follow-up on RWA, how much of the passive mitigation was embedded within the RWA results for Basel III this quarter?","Marianne Lake","So there is a little bit of passive mitigation with a little bit of runoff and there was also some declines as we purchase that securities and those were offset by some other things. So it wasn\u2019t a very big number because as I say that wasn\u2019t leading over time and the model enhancements which were about a half of the 100 basis point benefit will be a bit back ended.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, so really that\u2019s going to come later this year is what you are saying.","Marianne Lake","Yeah. Some of it late this year, some of it next.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And then on the NIM and LCR there is obviously an interplay there and could you just give us an update on where you are with the LCR this quarter because your NIM declined, this quarter actually was a lot lighter than what we were expecting?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so we showed you at Investor Day that we had a gap to be fully compliant, we are going to be compliant by the end of the year. We did close that gap, we closed not completely by about a third, obviously we also disclosed on the slide, you will see our HQLA or high quality liquid assets which it has a relationship based on up, but that is a numerator and the denominator changes to, so think about this and we made good progress, we closed the gap by about a third and we are on the way to compliance.","James Dimon","I think it\u2019s in when she talked when Mary gave you the forecast going forward for NIM?","Marianne Lake","Yeah.","James Dimon","That includes changing how we create more LCR.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right, okay and then lastly just on the CCAR conditional approval, can you just give us a sense because I think people were a lit bit surprised to see that you had the conditional approval results and yet you\u2019re able to do the buyback and the dividend hike that you asked for, so I guess generally in question is what can you speak to with regard to what\u2019s being asked and what kind of timeframe, do you think you have for satisfying the regulatory requirements here?","James Dimon","Let me just add, on the qualitative stuff, we\u2019ve passed and that\u2019s why we got the capital plan, their criticisms were on qualitative and from what we know now and we\u2019re still doing work and we will give you more is around lot more granular type of forecasting, they want more [interesting] private type of forecasting and so, we\u2019re having conversation with them. Marianne has formed the CCAR department, which is going to become experts in CCAR.","Marianne Lake","And that\u2019s in terms of the timeline, we are resubmitting as requested in the third quarter. We\u2019re doing everything between now and then to remediate and improve our processes following that feedback. So, we are committed to being successful.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","So, just to follow-up on the question on litigation, so that dropped to the $0.3 billion. Is that potentially, are we now adjusting to a lower level or was that just like no ways in what it is extremely a volatile number bouncing around the world?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. Brennan, I think it\u2019s very hard to predict and you\u2019re right that it bounces around and then it can be noisy. We have high level of litigation reserves in the third quarter of last year and we hope that the numbers will remain low but we can\u2019t predict them for you I\u2019m afraid.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Sure. Okay. But, I guess said another way, you guys don\u2019t see anything changing in the environment that would lead you to believe or be comfortable with a lower level of assumption of litigation expenses. What do you think about?","James Dimon","I think it\u2019s always going to be lumpy because we have to do with these things in due course. I think in the prior year as we put away a lot, we won\u2019t get the same predominantly mortgage, largely mortgage, et cetera and obviously the fact that we\u2019re not doing more means we think we\u2019ve got them. We did a lot of work in that. It could always change, but we\u2019ve done thorough analysis, as a lot of you all did, by the way, we did it at the tranche level almost in, so it could be permanently low yes. It could be permanently low. It doesn\u2019t have to go higher and obviously lot of things coming our way, we have to reserve for properties as they come in.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Yes, let\u2019s hope so. Okay and then the spread in mortgage compression was kind of meaningful here at this quarter. What inning do you think we\u2019re in there ballpark, I know it is kind of tough to predict this all as well?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I mean it\u2019s tough to predict but maybe the thing is, look at is if you take off pretax spread right now of 100 basis points that compares to a longer term sort of average run rate of 65 basis points before the crisis. So we\u2019ve been setting down from a very, very high level at the beginning of 2012 and we\u2019re back to a level where frankly we are not that far away from the longer term run rate and it\u2019s driven by the primary, secondary spread which came in about 20 basis points in the quarter back to levels again still more normal. So I don\u2019t know I could say anymore in present but it doesn\u2019t feel like we have another big step change to guys.","James Dimon","So we expect it might be up a little bit next quarter not down for a variety of reasons.","Marianne Lake","Doesn\u2019t make volatility quarter-on-quarter but for this year, we can grow in and around this range.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Okay. Okay. So this is the right way to think about it, so that helps. And then last one for me, when you think about your cap markets business and depending change, you guys chatted a little bit about it with Glen on swap clearing that June seems like the bigger date, Basel and all of the subsequent changes to the competitive environment, competitors adjusting their size of the business. What have you, how do you feel about your business there particularly on the fixed side more capital intensive businesses.","Do you think that there is this presents an opportunity to maybe go through review and right size maybe increase the efficiency measures there or do you feel comfortable keeping your business where it is roughly?","James Dimon","","Lot of that business is what we call, flow business, so little bit credit emerging markets rates FX clients, when we deal the clients who are around the world, maybe need those services and you\u2019re obviously always trying to become more efficient. So when you look at FX, I\u2019m going to say 80% is electronic. If you look at rates, the electronic number is going to go up and so which is going to drive efficiency, but we still think price going to need it. There will be price to pay for and obviously everything will be adjusted to Basel III. But as you pointed out, some people are leaving the business, some are getting in the business, we think it has a good future, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America.","L. Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. I just had one follow-up question to Betsy\u2019s inquiry on capital return. So clearly we now have two years as the Stress Test behind us and you are initially approved in 2012 for a $15 billion buyback and $6 billion this year, I guess what do you, does the Fed need to see and you\u2019re building capital clearly. What do you think that Fed needs to see from you in terms of the qualitative issues to get back to the kind of capital return that they clearly in 2012, they thought you had plenty of capacity to pay out?","James Dimon","Erika, you\u2019re confusing two different things. I really took good quality they\u2019re giving us more feedback and where they say we started showing the quality like I mentioned them, idiosyncratic, more level detail, more enterprise-wide type of forecasting, et cetera. That\u2019s one issue, the second is, the actual dollar amount. The Fed has made it very clear, they want people to get to their Basel III targets, ours is at least 9.5. Ben Bernanke said on a speech he gave that the banks that they did the stress test on have more capital after extreme stress then they started with the cap in the crisis.","So the Fed I think is feeling more and more comfortable, not just individual banks but the system as a whole. And we\u2019ve reduced the 15 down to 6, because we wanted to get to our 9.5 target faster, that\u2019s why we did it.","L. Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","James Dimon","We just changed our mind, we want to get to 9.5 this year, we want to get LCR this year, and obviously they made change to stress test next year and sooner we\u2019re going to have a conservation buffer coming in, and we don\u2019t know how the interplay of those two things will work.","L. Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And, given what you just mentioned, is it too optimistic to assume for next year a buyback in the $12 to $15 billion range?","Marianne Lake","I think it\u2019s too early to say.","James Dimon","","Yeah, it\u2019s too early to perhaps tell that.","Marianne Lake","Okay. Thank you.","James Dimon","Remember, that\u2019s going to relate to how fast you grow and other request from regulators, so we will take that when we get there.","","Marianne Lake","Yeah, but we do, Erika we do expect that we will be continuing to pay capital just through this 100 basis points of passive runoff mitigation, so certainly our capital levels will be stronger and we just have to see how things play out.","L. Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","James Dimon","Good morning.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Loan growth, it\u2019s a little bit softer, and I think you mentioned there was some push forward to the fourth quarter, but you also mentioned more competition and lower levels of demand, if I heard you correctly.","Marianne Lake","Yes.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","So, my question is how much of the softer loan growth is due to JPMorgan perhaps pulling back, how much it\u2019s due to the economy?","Marianne Lake","So, if I could, little difficult to side it for you, but we did see I don\u2019t know still people thought in the fourth quarter just given the year end issues that people were concerned about, and so that has had an impact. I think it\u2019s slightly less of an impact and in terms of competitive landscape and there are deals being done with terms and conditions and pricing that we\u2019re not comfortable at the moment, and we\u2019re just remaining very disciplined, so that has had an impact for us.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","So, really on the lower level of demand, I mean what was your loan utilization in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter?","Marianne Lake","It will be flat. It will be flat at around 32%.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","I\u2019m sorry.","Marianne Lake","It will be flat at around 32%.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","32%?","Marianne Lake","Correct.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","And so what\u2019s that kind of flat or down a little bit?","Marianne Lake","It will be flat, flat.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Flat and is that just why aren\u2019t people borrowing more?","Marianne Lake","As we have, we saw declines in deposits. So they\u2019re using that cash and they\u2019re out.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay, and then a separate question, looking at the annual report, page four of the Chairman\u2019s letter said, refers to regulation, and some of the issues that you faced and said we will see more of these, I\u2019m sorry. So when you say we will see more of these Jamie, what are you talking about because people\u2019s imagination can go in a lot of different directions, are we talking Department of Justice, SEC, FBI, or you think of anything particular or general or a timeframe, and really what I\u2019m asking you to address is the regulatory tail risk of we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know in terms of potential government moves as relates to JPMorgan?","Marianne Lake","So Mike, it\u2019s Marianne, so we\u2019re in constant dialogue with our regulators, and so we know that we should be expecting some more consent orders, but to clarify for you they relate to issues that we\u2019ve been working on over the course of the last several years so even though new breaking issues that will surprise you in any material way.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay and was there anything new as part of the 11 hearings that would change the way you would think about the London Whale incident because there were some pretty damming information, some unknowns at least to those who follow the company, but from your perspective, is there anything else that you need to do as a result of the information from those hearings?","Marianne Lake","So Mike, we can\u2019t really go into the details of the reports in specifics, but we obviously respect the work of the subcommittee where we respect the findings they had and we\u2019re working very hard to fix our issues and as it relates to the proposal and the recommendation to require documentation associated with portfolio hedging, identifying the specific risks that the hedge is designed to mitigate and then monitoring over time, we tend to agree that that makes a lot of sense in the context of what we face.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","And then lastly, when you talk about some additional changes that need to take place. And I think some of these are organizational, is there anything major news that you did not cover at the Investors\u2019 Day recently?","Marianne Lake","No, actually, there was couple of things I would say, first that, we are organizing ourselves around the control and regulatory agenda, because it\u2019s a high priority for us and we are getting ourselves organized in the same way as we would around in our merger and acquisition. And in doing that we are prioritizing our work, but we\u2019re not changing our overall strategy, we are not going to change the way, we see our customers how we think about growing our businesses, but at the margin we\u2019re going to refocus our energies on making sure that we execute on the commitments to improve the control and regulatory environment.","Michael Mayo \u2013 CLSA","All right. Thank you.","Marianne Lake","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Marianne Lake","Hi, Matt, hello\u2026","Operator","Mr. Burnell your line is open. Please go ahead.","Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Sorry, can you hear me now?","Marianne Lake","Yes.","Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to drilled down a little bit on the mortgage side of things, mortgage originations were a little bit stronger than we expected up about 3% and applications were down about 8%, you suggested that you thought that gain on sale margins might be relatively flattish going through the next couple of quarters, I guess, I\u2019m just curious that what\u2019s your thoughts are in terms of the mortgage origination market away from the gain on sale issues that you have been facing?","Marianne Lake","Yeah, so, in applications, I see it come back our rates have come down a little in the second quarter and for us in particular starting there we are expecting refi volumes to stay high, we did see a little bit of an increase in purchase volumes in the applications in the first quarter a bit from a smaller base and also we did the MetLife transaction. So, we have the opportunity to be working in that portfolio. So, our view on volumes for the year is that they\u2019re going to remain solid although there will be some volatility really on the back of continued strength in refinancing and you saw the half extension so more broadly for the market, I think refi including half will be a level of support for volumes this year.","Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","And then Marianne question on NIM clearly your moves on the LCR had some effect on NIM over the last quarter or two. Can you separate what you think that that the net interest margin movements will be for JPMorgan excluding your moves for the LCR or is it just so intertwined that you really can\u2019t do that?","Marianne Lake","Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s really, honestly it\u2019s really all part of how we think about positioning the organization and they\u2019re being compliant with LCR is part of our new reality. So, it\u2019s just a part of even better into this, how we\u2019re thinking about the overall positioning of the firm, so it\u2019s not something we\u2019re separating out for you.","Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And then, just finally, we saw a fairly sizable decline in value or risk both in the CIB and overall. Can you give us a little more color as to what\u2019s going on there, what we might be able to expect in the second quarter?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s helped me, we do in the second quarter, it is a real reduction in risk across the portfolio including and not driven by that, including the synthetic credit portfolio which we continue to de-risk. But, it is important to know if you look across asset classes, there\u2019s been a very significant decline in levels of volatility, that effect, the time series around the back period, so that necessarily have bad days rolled off and better days rolled on and so when we complete our bar, pushing the bar down lower. So, as long as volatility remains lower and we continue to de-risk, there are reasons to believe they will be at or around this level, but it is going to be subject to changes and volatility as and when they happen.","Matthew Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Marianne Lake","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse - North America","Great, thanks. Couple of kind of cleanup things, when you are looking at the getting to the 9.5%, did you kind of factor in that 100 basis points or is that something that would be on top of that 9.5%.","James Dimon","It\u2019s factored in.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse - North America","Factored in.","James Dimon","It\u2019s factored in.","Marianne Lake","Yeah, it\u2019s an all-in number for us. So, to the degree that we expect that to happen by the year end, it\u2019s all part of the number including some (inaudible) the whole thing.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse - North America","Got it. Okay. And, kind of talking qualitatively about the C-Card process, also there was a pretty large impact on PPNR which it seemed to be like the Fed\u2019s looking at pretty harsh, I guess a pretty harsh look at kind of trading losses. I mean do you have \u2013 have you had any kind of clarity from them about how they \u2013 whether they are looking at that revenue stream differently than other banking revenue streams?","Marianne Lake","Yeah, I\u2019ll take the two things separately the PPNR section and trading losses. So, on the trading losses obviously there is a number of different [stresses] that we do and while our number was different. I don\u2019t think we feel like there is anything about our processes that is in the period you\u2019re going to change that as it relates to PPNR. We did get feedback that we need to look at certain of our revenue models and we need to look at them more centrally and as Jamie said, with a slightly more negative view at it idiosyncratically and we are going to do that.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse - North America","Okay. And then lastly, on the mortgage business, you look like kind of in the core production, the expense reduction was about half of the revenue decline. How do you think about the \u2013 as that business continues to normalize? As you said, it\u2019s probably mostly normalized from a gain on sale perspective although you probably have some volume issues as we go through the rest of the year. I mean, how do you think about the cost structure of that business as you go forward?","Marianne Lake","So, couple of things, one is we are expecting to and hoping to, we set a target for ourselves to gain share. We do expect volumes to be supported by refinancing this year, so that is our expectation that could change of course. And then as it relates to the cost structure, obviously that comes down a little bit more slowly over time but we\u2019re making progress. And we talked about the fact that we expect that to be down at $600 million run rate for the fourth quarter and down to $325 million sometime over the next couple of years. And we\u2019re actively working on optimizing our servicing business both the core performing servicing and so that obviously with the (inaudible) sale, but also where it would make sense we would be open to doing sales on sub-servicing of delinquent loans and we\u2019re working two of things to try and get the cost structure to the best as it can be.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse - North America","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research","Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Matt.","James Dimon","Good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research","I thought this is one of the cleanout quarters in a while, so I just had one follow up here. In the private equity you took some losses on the private portfolio just wondering what drove that. And then also the outlook for this business under Basel III and Volcker even though we don\u2019t exactly know what Volcker is yet.","James Dimon","You know private equity, we\u2019ve always told you this won\u2019t be and it\u2019s just mark-downs and write-downs of existing positions, and we don\u2019t go through the specific names, but obviously we hope it will earn a profit, so it just wasn\u2019t a pretty big quote to private equity. And, the private equity legally can survive Volcker and all those things, so we like the business, we would like the people and you just have to do it in a different basis, that\u2019s all.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research","Is there any seasonality in terms of getting on a year-end or mid-year statements on the private portfolios?","James Dimon","No, there is no seasonality in private equity. It\u2019s constantly being reviewed.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Marianne Lake","But it\u2019s lumpy.","James Dimon","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Good morning. First thing I wanted to ask was, if we could dig in a little bit on the repurchase losses within mortgage servicing, such a big swing versus the fourth quarter an $81 million, it sounds like a reserve build, because I think, I heard you say that your actual realized losses were not significant and yet the guidance remains that it should be kind of a net zero. So it just seems like there were a lot of moving parts there. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little sense for why you have the $81 million hit?","Marianne Lake","Yes, absolutely. Guy it\u2019s a big change for the fourth quarter of with the small number. So not to diminish the size of the numbers that positive 50, negative 80 and sort of plus or minus around the zero level, and what are the factor of Guy is that the reserve release is based upon our model and realized losses is based upon agency activity, and so the timing isn\u2019t exactly perfect.","So realized losses came down from about $200 million to a $180 million, and we\u2019ve didn\u2019t build reserves, we\u2019ve release them just not at the same order of magnitude and it\u2019s really to do a timing, which is why we say that we do expect over time they will met the zero last quarter and with the small positive this quarter, it\u2019s a small negative nothing to read into it.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. Thanks for that. With regard to the CCAR process and some of the changes that the Fed is asking you to make. First of all just qualitatively, can you give us a sense for the amount of dialog that you have with the Fed one as you work towards satisfying their request, so that you really know exactly where they thought the deficiency were, or is there a lot of guess work for you on that?","Marianne Lake","So were in terms of dialog with regulators, we obviously can\u2019t comment on the specifics of our conversations with them. We have some very constructive conversations as we came out the 2013 CCAR process, and on the basis of those we\u2019re actively working to make the improvement they want us to make. We\u2019re also expecting to continue to get more and more detailed feedback and actually hope to get some industry best practice information too. So we\u2019re going to working and part of sit with them in terms of dialog all the way through this year, so that we can be clear on what CCAR looks like.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","And just if I can follow-up on, I think it was Moshe\u2019s question about the PPNR, it sounded like you were saying that many of the deficiencies that they were focusing on were in the inputs to the calculation of the stressed PPNR specifically is. Can I understand that right?","James Dimon","Guy, we haven\u2019t got a lot of feedback yet. So there\u2019ll be more to come. But we\u2019re going to be geared up to do it, and I think we want to be best-in-class with CCAR. The answer is absolute part was in PPNR, I mentioned just one (inaudible) product exposure and risk in PPNR, so if when you\u2019re going to addressed as you could assume that your company is just dealing with all those macroeconomic factors, which you forecast, you\u2019re going to assume, your company is going through as macroeconomic forecast plus you want to some other kind of stress, you can lose market shares. Obviously that would change your PPNR. So we\u2019ll be having more dialog in front of figure out make sure we do the right thing here.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. I hope it doesn\u2019t sound too crazy, but just to think about at the other way, is there any chance that after the resubmission or as part of the resubmission given how close you are to your Basel III targets and with some of that 100 basis points coming in. Is there any chance that you would ask for and could get an increase for this year?","James Dimon","Well, this is just a resubmission of the progress program, and then like to see qualitative improvements. This is not to change your request at all, this is the one Marianne referred to that will be in the third quarter. . .","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Yes, yes, yes that\u2019s what I talking about.","James Dimon","Obviously doing other CCAR in January.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Got it. And then final question, you mentioned Jamie in the shareholder letter that just because you don\u2019t have big fancy names cost-cutting programs, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not very focused on cost reduction. Is that what we\u2019re seeing in the fact that if you look at the CIB, your comp was down 7% versus your revenue being plus or is it that you did something different in the way you think about through the year accruals.","James Dimon","Through the year accruals it\u2019s almost exactly the same as based upon it is a lot of stuff, because of that number, but that really hasn\u2019t changed that much.","Marianne Lake","And I see you couldn\u2019t normalize out to DVA, which was an odd loss last process if you normalize that our out revenues are down. So it\u2019s not come down on that number.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Yes, that\u2019s fair. That\u2019s fair.","James Dimon","As referring to that we\u2019re constantly putting a new operationals, new systems to reduce overhead. Marianne already mentioned there were a bunch of things. We\u2019re doing in mortgage. We\u2019re seeing similar efforts in consumer. That\u2019s a constant effort. We do have names for some of them by the way, I\u2019m just not mentioning here.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. But there\u2019s nothing different like you said in terms of the way you accrue for bonuses within the investment bank?","James Dimon","No.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning. I had some questions on the commercial banking line of business. You had a nice increase in the real estate lending area in the first quarter, it look like it was about $9 billion after four quarters of essentially flat to down real estate loans. Can you give us some color on where the growth was?","James Dimon","Well, I think you\u2019re referring to the CTL\u2026","Marianne Lake","Yeah.","James Dimon","The Commercial Term Lending, which is lending against multi-family, and we have seen growth in it. Remember that was like 65% LTV. It did great through this last downturn, so we\u2019re very comfortable with that kind of lending.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Are you guys finding greater demand? Or are you just more comfortable with it now than you were maybe a year ago?","James Dimon","I would say a little of both.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Following up on your guidance, the answer about corporate deposits dropping in the quarter, which obviously is a good sign if companies are using this for capital improvements. What\u2019s your outlook? Do you expect that to continue? Should we see that as a continued positive trend?","James Dimon","Are you talking about the commercial bank or the total company?","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Our commercial bank.","James Dimon","Well, we would expect to be kind of flat to down a little bit, as companies used their, I mean they have a lot of deposits, so I think we at our Investor Day and earlier told people they were kind of really high and we expect to come down, particularly before people start using the revolvers, so they do relate to each other.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I agree. I mean are your guys in the front-line hearing that from your customers that they expect to use more than for the reminder of the year do you think?","James Dimon","I don\u2019t know the answer to that.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Coming back to loan loss reserves, obviously, you\u2019ve got a great capital position. You\u2019ve pointed out that Bernanke has indicated that the banking system is super strong going through the stress test. With the current limit of loans of about $729 billion, what would be a normal reverse level in normal times compared to where you are today?","Marianne Lake","We did a whole page for you on where we thought the cycle reserve levels should be by business. Now some businesses most obviously that still have a way to go and there are other businesses in the wholesale side and the commercial banks that are below that through the cycle. So I would refer you back to that page, if you do the numbers from recollection on an annualized basis, our charge-off would be more or like $7 billion or $8 billion which more or less is not dissimilar the charge-off we\u2019ve seen it for different reasons, so I would refer you to take a look at that page.","James Dimon","Note that it\u2019s mostly mortgages will come down.","Marianne Lake","Yeah.","James Dimon","Think if everything else is close to normal, mortgage which in total is $9 billion eventually a lot lower than that, but that should take a couple of years.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Yeah. Thank you very much. I know a lot of my questions have been answered, but we saw yesterday that they extended to HARP out another two years and there is also some discussion coming out of the White House really that they could put some type of PR plan behind HARP to try to get more people to HARP. Do you think this will have any impact at all in getting more people of the sidelines and refine to the HARP programs?","Marianne Lake","Yeah. I mean let\u2019s talk for us specifically as you probably know we\u2019ve been very successful and proactive as it\u2019s relating to HARPing our own book. And by the end of this year, we fully expected to have been as successful and mind that as far as possible they will carry on. And that\u2019s not the case in the industry, so it\u2019s great news that HARP was extended out to the end of 2015. It will allow for other services to get there adopting their own, potentially to have cross service the HARP, which in turn should be good in terms of volumes although I don\u2019t think it will be at that change. And for us we\u2019re not expecting it to be a significant difference in our production or in our MSR values.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","How much, I mean, I don\u2019t know if you can disclose this or not, but how much do you think that you have HARP eligible and how many of those are HARP eligible loans that you do on a percentage basis? Do you think you\u2019ve touched most of them already?","Marianne Lake","Yeah, so we talked about we peaked into the HARP volumes in about second quarter of last year. I think overall, the first half of last year was high, came down slightly over 15%. Last year, we talked at our Investor Day that we thought that we go down to the high single digit this year and it is in terms of percentage of our production. And we are very, very active and have been very proactive in mailing our HARP population and expected to have completed the program by the end of the year. So we were on track and this doesn\u2019t change our expectations.","James Dimon","The total, if you take all mortgages, I think the numbers are $4 million will be HARP report today if they went to it, and I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 some inspired that more people don\u2019t do it to tell you the truth.","Marianne Lake","Yes.","James Dimon","But only the government can do either PR or I think a cross servicing is a bigger one and will make us slightly better. They are just things that slightly better, it\u2019s not going to dramatically change mortgage.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Yeah, I think a lot of companies have told us that they think that they\u2019ve got through most of the low hanging fruit with HARP, and that the people that aren\u2019t HARPing they doubt they will ever HARP. And so I\u2019m just wondering if there is a big PR push, if some of those guys will wake up and say, oh, maybe this isn\u2019t, maybe I need to look at this program.","James Dimon","Yeah, we hope so.","Marianne Lake","Yeah and I\u2026","James Dimon","Because we don\u2019t know any better than you. I mean\u2026","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Yeah.","James Dimon","Yeah.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nancy Bush of NAB Research.","Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC","Good morning.","James Dimon","Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC","A quick question sort of back to the brown that are stuff that\u2019s kind of hanging around out there, I mean I\u2019m reading what everybody else is that they are looking at sort of a 10% capital ratio with the possibility of another 5% tougher on top of that and basically touring away the concept of risk weighted assets and more or less of this rating Basel III as far as I can see. I mean, do you guys have any sense where this sort of 10%, 5% number comes from? Is there some sort of empirical evidence, or is it just sort of a backdoor way to try to get the biggest banks the break up?","James Dimon","You really have to ask them and we\u2019ll leave this to them and the regulators again.","Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research, LLC","","Well, is there, I mean, do you have a sense where the numbers are coming from?

Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2016 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.","We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $5.5 billion, EPS of $1.35, and a return on tangible common equity of 12% on $24 billion of revenue; and despite the general market backdrop and energy, our results this quarter were quite good and pretty straightforward.","Consumers remain on solid footing leading to robust growth in business drivers and strong financial performance. In Consumer we saw double-digit growth in deposits year-on-year, healthy loan growth across products driving 17% core loan growth for the firm, and high single-digit card sales volumes.","The wholesale businesses performed in line or better than expectations expressed at Investor Day and delivered decent financial results in challenging markets with significant volatility and global macro uncertainty.","The firm's results included one significant item, $773 million of wholesale credit costs, of which $529 million related to Oil & Gas reserves and $162 million related to Metals & Mining reserves, which were generally in line with our guidance. But we also experienced some charge-offs this quarter in these sectors totaling $48 million, which were already contemplated in the Investor Day guidance of up to $4.75 billion of charge-offs this year.","While oil prices have improved somewhat in March, they do remain near historically low levels and the market is not expecting the recovery to be strong. Further natural gas, which is a meaningful portion of our portfolio, does remain depressed. We don't feel that current prices are sufficient to spur a meaningful restart of production, and many of the cost reductions and conservation actions that have been taken are not easily and quickly reversed. Therefore, the impact of oil prices is somewhat asymmetric on credit costs.","Reserves are name-specific. They're based on downgrades reflecting the actual financial condition and liquidity position of borrowers. As such, we likely will see some incremental reserve build for the rest of the year, but they will be increasingly situation specific, and our ability to estimate them will improve over time.","However, using reasonable stress assumptions on draws, downgrades and considering spillover effects to closely related companies, those incremental reserves could reach $500 million plus or minus this year, but with a very high degree of variability around that number.","We continue to believe, overall, our client base is relatively well-positioned to weather this downturn, and we will be there to support them whenever feasible. We also monitor for contagion and aside from experiencing a couple of name-specific issues in very closely related companies and observing some general stress in oil regions, we are not seeing anything broad-based and would not expect losses to be significant.","Moving on to page two, pausing on this page for just a moment, a few comments on overall revenue and expense. We told you that the first rate hike together with our strong loan growth would drive 2016 NII higher by $2 billion and the $700 million increase in net interest income year-over-year, that you see here, is in line with that. However, sequentially NII was only up slightly as expected given the absence of certain securities gains that we had in the fourth quarter, as well as day count.","Noninterest revenue was down $1.5 billion year-on-year primarily driven by the market environment in both the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as Asset Management with the biggest drivers being lower IB fees and Fixed Income market's revenue in both case versus a very strong prior year. Adjusted expense of $13.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year on lower performance-based compensation while continuing to self-fund incremental investments and growth.","Turning to page three. The firm's fully phased-in advanced CET1 ratio was 11.7%, with standardized at 11.9%. The improvement to both ratios was driven primarily by net capital generation. Recall that we ended the year with very low levels of inventory and as expected, we did see that reverse with our spot balance sheet up $70 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting growth in deposits and an increase in trading assets and secured financing activity. This also drove a slight increase in RWA net of runoff and model calibration. Firm SLR improved to 6.6%, and we returned $3 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1.3 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 per share.","Lastly, the Fed did not object to a $1.9 billion increase in our capital plan giving incremental capacity for repurchases next quarter.","Moving on to page four in Consumer & Community Banking. You'll notice that we consolidated Consumer into one page, and for your reference we've included the old pages in the appendix. CCB generated $2.5 billion of net income and an ROE of 19% with strength across all lines of business. And TNS just announced that for the fourth consecutive year, we are the number one consumer retail bank reflecting our ability to attract, satisfy and retain customers.","The fundamental business drivers remain strong, with average loans up 12% year-on-year and core loans up 25%, driven by mortgage and auto, but with strength across products. And we saw record deposit growth of $50 billion, up 10%. We added over 1 million households since last year, and our active mobile customer base was up 19%. Revenue of $11.1 billion was up 4% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially if you exclude from last quarter nearly $200 million from the Square IPO and a branch sale.","In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 4% year-on-year, reflecting that record deposit growth I mentioned, as well as higher account and transaction volumes and investment revenue up 4% despite the challenging environment. Mortgage revenue increased 7% on higher MSR risk management and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was up 2% on strong auto loan and lease growth, 8% growth in card sales, and 12% in merchant processing volumes, all of which more than offset the impact of card renegotiation.","Expense was down 2% year-on-year with an overhead ratio improving to 55% as we continue to make progress against our commitment, more than offsetting $200 million in incremental marketing and auto lease growth. Finally, credit trends in the consumer businesses continue to be favorable.","Now turning to page five and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $8.1 billion and an ROE of 11%. In Banking, IB revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24% year-on-year, driven by lower equity and debt underwriting fees, but in line with the market which was down 27%. We continue to rank number one in global IB fees and rank number one in three regions, North America, EMEA, and LatAm. It was another strong quarter for advisory, up 8%, versus a wallet that declined 15%. We gained share, ranking number one as we benefited from a number of deals that were announced in 2015 and closed this quarter.","Equity underwriting fees were down 49%, in line with the market, as volatility kept issuers on the sidelines. We maintained our number one rank globally and increased our lead. Debt underwriting fees were down 35%. And while we were down more than the market, it can be explained by a tough comparison, with several large acquisition finance deals in the first quarter of last year, as well as being conflicted out of several large deals this quarter.","In terms of the outlook, we expect a sequential decline in M&A to be more than offset by an increase in debt and equity underwriting if the recent market improvements continue.","Treasury Services revenue was down 5%, driven by business simplification. Lending revenue was down 31%, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes on both hedges of accrual loans and securities received from restructuring.","Moving on to Markets, Markets revenue was $5.2 billion and was down 11% year on year, reflecting decent performance given the environment and especially in light of the strength in the first quarter of 2015, where we saw elevated client wallet and trading, particularly in January last year, particularly around the Swiss franc event. In fact, if you'll indulge me, adjusting for our outperformance year over year, results would have been down by mid-single digits.","Fixed income revenue was down 13%. The first couple of months of this quarter, as you know, were challenging across markets, but some stability returned in March. And overall, I would characterize the quarter as seeing reasonably solid client activity, but given the market backdrop, it was more difficult to monetize flows. We saw better performance in rates and lower performance across other asset classes.","Equity Markets revenue was down 5%. And although flows were steady, idiosyncratic events and sharp moves were tough for our clients both on the way down and back up. Asia equities continued to outperform, driven by market volatility, particularly in Japan.","With respect to the second quarter, the relative stability we saw in March has continued into April so far. However, it's also the case that markets are still quite illiquid in certain parts and will be prone to somewhat abrupt corrections. So while investors have started to deploy cash and capital markets are wide open for well-understood names, there is still remaining caution for more challenging issuers. Although there has been noise in the data globally, there is an emerging belief that it's fundamentally better but we need to continue to see no downside surprises. And as such, we remain somewhat cautious about the second quarter.","Securities Services revenues was $881 million, in line with guidance. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $336 million, mainly driven by CVA on spread widening. Credit costs of $459 million were driven by reserve builds for Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, as discussed earlier. And finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 15% year on year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower legal expense, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 32%.","Moving on to page six and Commercial Banking, the Commercial Bank generated net income of $500 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 11%. Outside of credit costs for Oil & Gas, the first quarter was very solid performance. Revenue was up 4% year on year, driven by higher loan balances and deposit net interest income, offset by lower IB revenues versus a record last year. Expense of $713 million was up 1% year on year and down 5% quarter-on-quarter, but in line with recent trends if you exclude the impairment taken on leased corporate aircraft last quarter.","We saw strong growth in our loan book, with average loan balances up 13% year on year and 3% quarter-on-quarter and with portfolio spreads relatively flat for a couple of quarters now.","Our Commercial Real Estate business continued to exceed the industry with growth of 18% year on year, reflecting superior execution while maintaining credit discipline. In C&I, loans were up 9% year on year, driven by robust originations in Corporate Client Banking. Finally, on Credit, we added $300 million to reserves, mostly related to Oil & Gas, but we continue to see very low net charge-offs.","Moving on to page seven and Asset Management, Asset Management reported net income of $587 million with a 30% pre-tax margin and 25% ROE. Revenue of $3 billion was down 1% year-on-year, driven by weaker market and lower brokerage revenues.","Excluding the impact of the sale of an asset this quarter, which contributed $150 million to the revenue number, adjusted revenue, AUM and client assets were down each generally in line with lower market. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 5% year-on-year largely driven by lower performance-based compensation.","Despite these lower markets, we saw positive long-term flows of $12 billion this quarter with strength in fixed income, multi-asset and alternative and including the benefit of a large mandate being partially offset by outflows in equity products given volatility. Our long-term investment performance remains strong with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Loan balances of $110 billion were up 7% year-on-year with record mortgage balances up 20% and solid growth in traditional lending.","Before I move on, as you're aware the Department of Labor issued the final fiduciary rule last week. It's a long and complex set of requirements and details will matter. It will take time to fully digest. On first read, there are no significant new provisions from the proposal that would change our position, which is that we've been a fiduciary for over 150 years and based on our current advisory business, we are confident in our ability to adjust and be successful. Perhaps one of the biggest positives is the longer time to implement, which allows us to be even better prepared.","Skipping page eight, as we actually have nothing significant to call out on Corporate, I will move onto the outlook on page nine. We've included our guidance from Investor Day on the page. And it's unchanged, so I won't go through it. So just two new points to highlight. For Asset Management, the first quarter revenues adjusted for the $150 million were a little over $2.8 billion. And assuming relatively constructive markets, we would expect those revenues in the second quarter to be flat to up but to be less than $3 billion. And obviously, expense will also be flat to up in line with those revenues on performance-based compensation.","In the Commercial Bank, we expect revenues will be up modestly on continued loan growth. But we also expect expenses to increase to about $725 million as we add bankers and execute on our technology and product investment strategies. The upshot of which is we expect pre-provision net revenue for the Commercial Bank to be relatively in line with the first quarter.","Before moving to Q&A, I want to make a few comments about the news this morning regarding living wills. Obviously, we were disappointed with the conclusion reached by the joint agencies on our resolution plan. We have taken this planning process very seriously and we believe we've made substantial progress. Having said that, the most important thing is we work with our regulators to understand their feedback fully and in more detail. And we are fully committed to meeting their expectations.","So wrapping up, despite challenging market conditions, we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments and be there for our clients.","Operator, you can open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Burnell. One moment. Please go ahead.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Marianne, maybe a couple of questions on energy. You noted that the provision was slightly above your guidance this quarter relative to what you mentioned you thought it might be in late February. I guess I'm curious in terms of what your expectations are in terms of your guidance relative to potential drawdowns, particularly in the $10 billion of high-yield loans that you have undrawn, and what your ability is to potentially mitigate potential drawdowns based on the financial condition of your borrowers?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, hi, Matt. So the first thing I would say is with respect to Oil & Gas, honestly, I think $529 million is pretty close to $500 million plus or minus, so that was pretty much in line. Where you are seeing it be a little bit higher was on Metals & Mining. We're expecting close to $100 million, and there were a couple of extra downgrades that came through in the quarter, and that kind of timing is going to happen. It doesn't change the overall sort of perspective for us.","With respect to draws, when I gave some sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve builds, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental draws. And clearly, we will work with borrowers to try and help them such that that may not be necessary and in other cases we can reduce our exposure in redetermination cases.","But we will expect to see some draws and that's contemplated in our guidance. And I want to make sure that everyone understood that we tried to be very complete, so this is not just Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining. As the NAIC codes would suggest, we've looked at very closely related companies in shipping and marine transportation and the like. So we're trying to be very complete.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we've yet to take a loss.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have taken a couple.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(20:00)","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Nothing \u2013 not very much.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Fair enough, that makes sense. But that dovetails nicely actually into my follow-up. In terms of the wholesale non-accrual balances, those were up about $1.2 billion quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us a sense as to how much of that was energy and Metals & Mining? And were there other areas of the portfolio that added to that? And what's your outlook for wholesale non-accruals over the course of the next couple of quarters?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So of the $1.2 billion, $1 billion was a combination of Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, so the vast majority. And outside of that, consistent with my comments on contagion, there's not any sort of thematic, other noteworthy thing to mention to you.","And obviously, as we continue to watch the sort of cycle play out over the next several quarters and reevaluate some clients that may be experiencing stress, it's likely that we will see some more NPLs. But I gave you context around what we're expecting to see in terms of reserves, so they will go up, but not to numbers that I would consider to be large in the context of our wholesale portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi. Just one follow-up. What was the drawn-on energy facilities this quarter? It doesn't seem to be too big. And then related to that, what's the reserve as a percentage of drawn credit right now?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The draws were about $1.3 billion in the quarter, so some but not excessive. And after the reserves that we put up in the first quarter, the coverage ratio is 6.3%.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","6.3%, all right. I also think...","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","what is the number on balance sheet?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That is on the balance sheet.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","And then maybe a little bit of different question...","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sorry, Glenn, just on that 6.3%, that's the firm. If you look in the Commercial Bank, obviously, it's higher. So you've got a sort of different portfolio mix in the Commercial Bank versus the CIB. So for some parts of our portfolio, it's closer to 9% or 10% and in other parts it's lower. Sorry, your second question?","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","I appreciate that and I thank you.","Yeah. The other question is on growth. We've been waiting for a long time, but you've been seeing great growth across a lot of different products. I mean, CRE up 18%, in the Commercial Bank, C&I up 9%. At this stage of the cycle, I appreciate the Consumer has shown a lot of strength, is there any growth where we scratch our heads and said, wow, is that growing too much? It sounds funny for me to be asking for less growth, but just curious to get your thoughts.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a perfectly reasonable question. And obviously, when we look at growth in CRE or the Commercial Real Estate businesses of 18%, it's an obvious question are you doing something different? And the answer is no, we're not. We haven't changed our geographies. We haven't changed our risk appetite. It just simply indicates that we have a good process, and we are continuing to focus on our sort of core capabilities and our core risk segments. But we've been able to take advantage of the opportunity because our process is better, and to a lesser degree, but nonetheless to a degree, given that the CMBS market has been somewhat disrupted.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. Good morning.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I have a question on the living wills. The indication today was that there were four areas that you needed to enhance. Liquidity was one of those, and I was a little surprised to see that given the strength of your liquidity book. I guess what I'm wondering is does the living will submission and the changes that you have to make have an impact on your current business at all? In other words, do you need to build liquidity to meet the requirements that the regulators have, or this is in an obviously worst-case scenario you would build at that time?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Betsy, obviously, with having only received the specific feedback less than 24 hours ago, we still have to get into the analysis phase about what it all means. I would start with your opening comments that considering our liquidity you were surprised, this doesn't appear to be a statement about the adequacy obviously of JPMorgan's liquidity, which is very significant, as you know; but it's really about how we analyze and think about that at the material legal entity level and the inter-affiliate nature of how we fund our entity. So I can't tell you with any clarity exactly what will be required as we get into the analysis. It wouldn't be my core expectation that it would require us to do a meaningful overall new liquidity action, but we have to do the work.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So as we think about the implications of this morning's announcement, it's around your planning and procedures as opposed to a likely impact on the business operations today and the results that you can generate. Is that a reasonable conclusion?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, just based on our preliminary read, I think there's going to be significant work to meet the expectations of the regulators and our plan already had us doing a lot of work around actual real simplification of legal entities and other things. So I don't know that there are going to be significant changes. It's not my primary expectation that there would be, but we do need to have a moment to go through the details.","Operator","Your next...","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The liquidity of the company is extraordinary. We have $400 billion in central banks around the world, $300 billion of AA+ short duration securities, just about $300 billion of very short-term secured, really top-quality repo type of stuff like that. The trading book is $300 billion, which is mostly very liquid kind of stuff, so the liquidity of the company is extraordinary.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I would say just, again, we need to do the work and we need to figure out, obviously, what the response to that will be. But it is encouraging that some plans were found to be credible for large systemic financial institutions. And if they have been able to adequately show their preparedness, we're confident we should be able to do the same. We just need to make sure that we understand the details of what it is that we don't have in our plans today that we need to change, and we're committed to doing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Marianne, can you expand upon your comments in your opening dialogue about the energy exposure? You're not too worried about the contagion risk, but you did say that there are a couple of specific issues relating to some very closely related companies. Can you give us more color on what you're referring to?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, absolutely. So I just want to \u2013 if you use the industry codes the way that you could if you weren't to expand your thinking to just what is technically considered to be an oil and gas company, you would miss out on, for example, a marine shipping company that all they do is ship oil. And therefore, their financial condition and their performance is going to be directly related to the health of the energy sector. Those companies, we have identified them specifically, they are managed within our energy risk team. They are not managed by a different team. So I was simply saying that some of the companies that we are watching and in one or two small cases that had experienced some stress, are not traditional energy companies but their condition is directly related to oil and gas.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. And then on the loan growth, which is obviously very strong, what are your people on the front lines saying about commercial real estate? Are there any changes in terms of underwriting metrics that your front line people are seeing since we are starting to see in certain markets like multifamily, which you guys have already identified have some weak spots, are there any other underwriting issues that are cropping up now that you didn't see three months ago or six months ago?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, and obviously not for us, I would say that it's competitive. The C&I space is very competitive. Commercial Real Estate is also competitive, but it's not irrational and we aren't seeing, or at least we are not seeing very irrational proposals on structure and risk. Meanwhile, we haven't changed our risk appetite. We haven't changed our underwriting standards. We continue to have lower LTVs and higher debt coverage ratios pretty consistently, consistent geography. So speaking for JPMorgan specifically, there has been no change in our underwriting standards. In fact, if anything since the last crisis, obviously, or the last recession, we've tightened our underwriting standards and we've moved away from some of the riskier types of that business, so homebuilders and a lot of construction loan business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. That was a very serious CEO letter you had in the annual report, but two questions related to that. One would be, you, Jamie, indicate the potential for higher interest rates, and I'm just looking for some more color into why you think that's the case, and if you're preparing the bank for a scenario of higher rates or if you're just trying to just set a tone at the top or perhaps be contrarian. I know you gave some technical factors in the CEO letter.","And then the second thing is just the contrast between what you have in the CEO letter, liquidity, trading governance oversight with the living will letter that came out today. And just to follow up on the earlier question, do you simply have to write a better resolution plan, or might you have to change a little bit the way you do business? And does this make you have a more conservative CCAR ask?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Mike. I'll start and then Jamie can add to it. So on the interest rate point, the comments are pretty consistent with what we said over time, which is we have the belief that the U.S. economy is continuing to move in the right direction, that the consumer is on solid footing and that despite the noise in the data and some of the volatility in the markets, global growth will continue, albeit at a moderate pace. And obviously, stability in the markets in March has continued to help us with that thesis. And so that coupled with the fact that the Fed themselves \u2013 while they're dovish in their narrative in the minutes and also their dots are continuing to talk about gradual increases, and the debate around negative rates is quieting.","So we don't particularly run the company with a day-to-day view on what's going to happen with interest rates. We are positioned for rising rates, as you know, and have been, but we also understand what the performance of the company looks like if there are no more rate rises or when we stress our portfolios in lots of different ways. So we are positioned for rising rates. It is our central case that that will happen. The market is pricing less than one hike in this year. The Fed dots say two. Our research says two. We're just going to have to wait and see.","I'll also start and then Jamie can jump in on the living wills thing. We have to take it at face value in discussions with our regulators that we need to meet their requirements, whatever they may be, all of the rules, whether it's capital, whether it's liquidity, whether it's stress testing, whether it's resolution plans. And if we do that and satisfy them, then we can continue to operate the company the way that we think is best for our clients and communities around the world. And so at this point, we need to remediate and address the issues and the feedback they've given us and resubmit a plan for assessments that we hope will be credible. And that's certainly what we will commit to do, and that's what we're focused on.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Was there anything else from Jamie on that? Because if we compare and contrast the CEO letter to what the regulators just said about you guys, it's not completely consistent.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think it's inconsistent. We're trying to meet all the regulations, all the rules, and all the requirements. We've been doing that now for five years or six years. It is five \u2013 it's been six years since Dodd-Frank was passed. They have their job to do and we have to conform to it.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I know it's easy to overlook the first few statements where there's an acknowledgment that progress has been made. And none of the feedback in the letter negates the significant progress across the industry on capital liquidity, stress testing. So it is consistent, but we have more work to do and we'll do it.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And on the interest rate stuff, I wasn't predicting it. I'm simply saying I think there is a chance it will be different than what people expect and it will be a little \u2013 as I said, it will be gradual until it's sudden.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, good morning.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP","I wonder on trading. I appreciate that you reported first so you haven't seen the market yet, but two questions around the whole thesis, the last man standing versus restructures. One, do you have any sense of whether your performance overall on really FICC represented market share gains or not this quarter?","And then two, with some of the guidance coming out of the European banks in particular being very poor and some of the restructurings may be accelerating steam, is there any thought around comp and maybe using that as a lever to improve returns over the remainder of the year and into next?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So obviously, we're the first to read out. And it's very difficult when you think about performance because you also have to think about the relative performance in the comparable periods and prior years and the like. So I would say that down mid-single digits adjusted for what we would consider to have been outperformance last year is really quite good performance. So I don't know that we gained share, but I certainly think we've protected share. And it may differ across the different product sets, but I think in general, we feel pretty good about our performance, and we don't know anything to the contrary.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I would just add that $5 billion plus of sales and trading in a quarter like this I'd look at it as good. We're earning decent returns. We have good margins. I'm not quite sure about share, but it was quite \u2013 I would look at it as quite a good performance, and trading losses were, what we had was six days you said to me, or...","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Six days, yeah.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Six days, they...","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",".","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","They were (34:59) like $40,000. So the actual results are just \u2013 that's really good. I look at that as a very healthy business.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And then with respect to the sort of restructuring and whether that presents opportunities for us broadly defined, including in compensation for better performance, we pay for performance and we pay risk-adjusted returns, and we're not looking to try and make changes to what we've been very consistent about over time. And you can see our comp to revenue ratio of 33% (sic) [32%] this quarter is in line with the ratio in the first quarter of last year and in fact the first quarter of the year before. So lower, obviously, on lower revenues, but a fair pay for the performance. And obviously, we intend to ensure that we are competitive, but we're not going to take any direct action as a result of that in terms of the...","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We also got some big deals done near the end of the quarter in Western Digital and Numericable, which is part of sales and trading. And we also got a \u2013 we did this I thought a very creative Chase. I'll probably call it Chase Trust. It's the first real securitization in a long time in a mortgage business where you do revenue risk-sharing, and I think it's quite good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Just a question on expenses. First, was there any legal expense in the quarter? And then just a broader question, Marianne, are the incremental expense saves you're getting from your programs falling to the bottom line, or is it \u2013 some of it getting reinvesting? Like in CCB, I noticed the head count is up a little bit on page 11 just the last couple of quarters. Does that reflect like reinvestment of the cost saves? And then just on the legal side if you had anything this quarter. Thanks.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on legal, I would \u2013 so the number is circa zero pre-tax. It's actually slightly positive after-tax. We did some true-ups so far, assessment on penalties. So actually, net-net about zero this quarter, which I'll take it for the quarter, but it doesn't necessarily predict the future.","In terms of expenses, so we talked at Investor Day, Gordon in particular but also Daniel, that we are continuing to invest in our businesses and across the board, in fact, adding bankers and technology and digital, digitizing, et cetera. So we continue to do that across the businesses. And I mentioned in the CCB page that the net expenses, albeit down includes self-funding $200 million of incremental investments year-over-year and growth. But you did notice the head count in the Consumer Businesses is up slightly and that's a combination of the investments we're making in technology and digital; that's about 500 of the heads, and the other 1,500 is increasing part-time staffing in the branches so that we have flexibility to make sure that we have loading at the right times of day for making sure the customer experience is good. So I would characterize it all as very consistent and yes we continue to invest, and that is in part what you're seeing in the head count in CCB.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And you saw a new credit card, Freedom Unlimited, 1.5% back. We're doing a lot of stuff in Chase Pay. You heard \u2013 so, the Starbucks thing, we are part of top digital site \u2013 and we continue to win awards in the consumer banks, so we will always be investing there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning. You're fielding a lot of questions on energy credit quality. But taking a step back, given that the delinquency statistics outside of energy still remain fairly stable, could you give us an outlook for how you think credit quality trends will play out for the rest of the year if the base case is slow growth in the U.S.?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it is our expectation across both the Consumer and the Wholesale businesses outside of energy that the credit trends will remain favorable. Credit will be relatively benign. We're not expecting to see material increases except for the fact that we're growing our loan portfolios. So when we did Investor Day we talked about charge-offs this year will go up year-on-year, and they'll go up to potentially as high as $4.75 billion, but half of that would be on the back of the fact that we're growing our portfolios. And so you will just have natural sort of BAU levels of charge-off from that and then the over half would be on energy. So we're not expecting or seeing at this point anything other than good credit quality the rest of 2016 outside of the obvious.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And just one more follow-up question on the living will, could you help us understand what you think the regulators meant in terms of if the remediation is not met by October 1 of this year that there could be more stringent prudential requirements? Could that possibly mean higher capital or liquidity standards if the expectations aren't met by October? I guess we always thought of the living will as more of a cost issue rather than a further tax on regulatory ratios.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I will start by saying that as you know our regulators have extraordinary powers over a wide range of requirements for us regardless, and many ways of influencing those, and you're familiar with most of them. It is absolutely the case that as you look at the resolution process that there are provisions that talk about if a remediation is not satisfactory with or cured within a two-year period, there is a possibility that the regulators could jointly decide and may jointly decide to take other actions that could include capital or liquidity or leverage or operating model discussions. So obviously, they do have those powers, October is not that far away. We're going to do our very, very best to make sure that we put our best foot forward and remediate the issues. And then we have another submission in July of 2017.","So not to suggest that we won't fully remediate to the very best of our ability, but the living will process I expect to continue to be somewhat iterative over the next several cycles, and we will continue to push ourselves to raise the bar, and I'm certain that the bar will continue to be raised on us as it should.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","If I look at the first quarter net interest income, which was at least better than what I had, good NIM and think about your full-year outlook, if I take it literally, it implies flattish net interest income dollars from here. And I'm just wondering if that's too literal of interpretation or if maybe there are some offsets to the loan growth we say over the long-term rates as we think about the rest of the year.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So we talked about the fact that if there's no change in rates and if we continue to grow our loans we'd expect our NII to go up by $2 billion. And so you're right, if you look at the run rate right now that would be relatively flat from here.","I think in our favor because of the easing that's still going on around the rest of the world and the sort of dovish Fed comments there has been a lower re-price just in the industry generally, so that's in our favor but \u2013 and you know we're much more sensitive to the front-ended rate. So while we're not suggesting that the long end of the curve has no impact, it's relatively modest, so $2 billion may be a little more, the biggest driver of significantly higher NII above that guidance would be if we had another hike earlier than December.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then just separately, any comments on the Treasury's ruling on inversion as you think about M&A kind of broadly speaking for the industry and for you guys specifically and if you can frame how much that's driven your M&A revenues in the past or the industry. Any color around that would be helpful.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I'm not going to talk specifically about the Treasury's actions other than saying that we would support fair tax reform in general.","With respect to the impact on our business, either historically or going forward, it wouldn't be zero and it wouldn't be significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Maybe we could talk a little bit about CCAR. I've had some investors express concern about the Fed's inclusion of negative rates. Have you found that to be difficult in terms of modeling?","And overall I guess given the improvement in \u2013 on the flip side given the improvement in your capital ratios, do you think that there's \u2013 you should be able to see some improvement or increase in CCAR into \u2013 now that you've looked at it for a few months?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So obviously, I'm not going to be able to talk specifically about our plans that we've submitted because we just submitted them and we haven't had any feedback and they're confidential. But I will tell you that, obviously, negative rates. It was the first time this has been in the scenario. It is not the first time we have talked about it and it's not the first time that we've experienced it, at least in other parts of the world, in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere.","So we have had continued discussions. We understand broadly what we think we would do and what would happen to our balance sheet. We can model it and we can effect it. So in that sense now, I mean, obviously, we'll continue to work that process through if it continues to be a feature of CCAR.","You're absolutely right that year-over-year our launch point is a higher level of capital. And our balance sheet and our credit quality continues to improve, and our risk levels have not materially changed. So as a general matter, we would hope and we've also added prefs. So as a general matter, we would hope to have incremental capacity, but nothing inconsistent with what we have said externally, which is that the board would like over time to continue to have the capacity to potentially increase dividends, and that we would likely take capacity to within a reasonable range, repurchase our stock and that's the framework that we have used to submit our plan.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So, Marianne, within the Asset Management segment, you noted that the revenues were down in line with the market. But if we isolate the fee income components to exclude some of the IB (46:03) gains you highlighted as well as other income, the revenues declined by double-digit both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, which is a bit more pronounced than what we had expected. And I was hoping you could speak to maybe some of the factors outside of the market declines that are maybe impacting revenues in that business, specifically what you're seeing in terms of retail engagement and maybe whether you've seen any improvement in sentiment now that the markets have recovered pretty nicely off the February trough.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So if I do the sort of \u2013 I don't want to use the word core. If I adjust for the full impact of the asset sale that was in the quarter, not just the $150 million in this quarter, but also the revenues that were present with respect to that in the first quarter of last year, my adjusted revenues are down about 4% to a market that on average, while I appreciate that it recovered in March, but the market on average for the quarter was down around 5%. So we would characterize that as generally in line.","And similarly, if you do adjustments on the balance sheet side, the assets under management and client assets. So certainly, you can speak to Jason afterwards and reconcile our numbers so that we're not confusing each other. I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","The retail engagement.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Retail engagement, so retail engagement picked up in March, as you would expect. We saw positive flows. We obviously saw a negative flow for the quarter in equities, that's not surprising. And then we saw positive flows, particularly in multi-asset, so we did see some reasonably healthy retail flows in the quarter, but primarily in March and somewhat offset by outflows in equities.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Excellent, thank you.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, Marianne, a quick question on NIM here. Can you talk about how sustainable you think the NIM expansion might be and whether or not there's anything one-time in the numbers we should adjust for?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As luck would have it, in this quarter there is nothing one-time that you need to adjust for. Last quarter there obviously was, and so we would expect that our NIM should be stable to improving over the course of 2016, the extent to which it would improve obviously depending upon what happens in terms of gradually rising rates.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then on the energy exposures in the loan book, can you comment on maybe whether or not some of the equity capital raising that we've seen in the energy space has perhaps taken some of the tail risk away from that book? And then is it possible also to update us on the criticized exposures in oil and gas? I believe in the 10-K it was somewhere around $4.5 billion at year end.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, so with respect to equity capital raises, obviously to a degree that would be true, although those companies that were able to access the equity capital markets are not those that are experiencing the most stress. So obviously all other things equal, it's a positive, but I'm not necessarily thinking it's going to take significant steam or the pressure off. With respect to the second part of your question? I'm so sorry.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","C&C.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jason will get back to you. I'm sorry, I don't have the answer.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","No problem, thanks so much.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Marianne, can you comment on what competitive conditions are like in the credit card market currently and if there has been any change around the intensity of competition for co-brand and rewards? And I think, Jamie, you alluded to the launch of a new product. I'd love to get an update on your initial thoughts about how that's going.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So no, nothing has changed in the card competitive landscape, including in co-brand. It's still very competitive, albeit that we are \u2013 we saw a little bit of deceleration in sales growth year over year last year and we've seen that trend back positively for us this year. So we feel good about that and we've been increasing our marketing spend. And as Jamie just said, we launched Freedom Unlimited quite recently. And it has been quite recent, but early feedback is very positive with respect to Freedom. We're seeing 50% increases in activity and interest. There's going to be a degree of cannibalization of other products. We would expect that, but so far so good. And we just like to give our customers choices, and it's been favorably received.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great, thank you. And auto has been a big area of focus, and you touched on it certainly during your Investor Day. But in the mid-cycle range, is there anything going on, on a macro level that would suggest some significant likelihood of credit quality deterioration?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, the Manheim is down slightly. We continue to believe and expect that it will continue to trend downwards. And so losses per unit will continue to trend upwards just given where it is today and also the amount of leased inventory that will ultimately go into the used car space over the course of the next several years. However, the fundamentals are still good. The market is still solid. We had pulled back on subprime a while ago. It's a small part of our originations. And so other than seeing some delinquencies pick up as expected in some of the energy-related space but not very significantly, there's nothing at the moment that's on the burner.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For us.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","For us.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I do think you'll see issues in the market, though.","Operator","Your next question comes to line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, thank you very much. In the Mortgage Banking segment, you wrote down the MSR by almost $0.9 billion. Were there any hedging gains? I couldn't find them in the documents. Any hedging gains to offset that?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the MSR P&L for the quarter was a positive $124 million, and they're a combination of BAU immaterial factors that added up to that. And probably about half of it was a combination of hedged performance in the market.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And then on the Mortgage Banking side, have you been seeing \u2013 you saw the MBA today release that purchase applications are the highest since 2010 or something on that order. Are you seeing the spring buying season, especially on the purchase side, starting to pick up?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so our purchase applications are up 30% I think year on year. We're continuing to see positive momentum in that space, and we are seeing spring activity continuing to be robust as expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning, just two quick follow-ups on the fee side. Understanding that market dependence is built into the outlook to get to $50 billion of fees for the year, I'm just wondering. Have we now run-rated the combination of the business repositioning, the card revenue run rate, and the toughness of this first quarter? I guess the question is really what are the things that you expect to get better from the first quarter on the fee side outside of normal seasonality?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So in terms of run-rated, the two biggest drivers of the walk that we gave at Investor Day were the card co-brand renegotiations and the Mortgage Banking non-interest revenue. I would just point out that while we are seeing some of the incremental impact of card renegotiations, that will play out over the course of the year.","But on the positive side \u2013 and on the positive side, Mortgage Banking just given where rates were over the quarter has sort of been positive relative to the central expectations when we did Investor Day.","So those two things are worth noting, but we are seeing really quite good drivers in noninterest revenue drivers across the Consumer space generally in debit, investments, in fees and accounts in the sort of 4%-5% range and sometimes in the range higher than that. So we're continuing to see exactly what we expected which is the majority of our businesses will continue to deliver mid to high single-digit growth and they seem set to do that. The Card impact will be what it will be and Mortgage NIR will end up down year-over-year, whether it's $700 million or $600 million, we'll see. And so the biggest driver of what the end result will be is going to be Markets.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yes, okay. And I know it's a smaller line item, but just noticing the guide for security services to be flat from here. There's always some seasonality in there too, but I'm just wondering if you can just give a comment about what you're seeing in that business and are there any incremental challenges that leave you kind of with a flat outlook.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, look, the business is not immune to markets either. So obviously, as you look at their performance for the quarter, our fees have been impacted by lower asset levels, and we also have got the tail impact of some business simplification just getting the tail of that out of their performance.","We are also seeing the benefit of higher rates, so I would characterize the majority of those negatives on lower fees and simplification as being behind us, so the trajectory if rates continue to rise would be upwards, but that's why we said market-dependent. We were not expecting our performance to go down from here, flat to up but depending on rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities.","Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP","Yes. Good morning. The question is really on the compensation ratio. You've obviously done a fantastic job on the cost base, but one of the issues that strikes me is clearly with the reduced revenues, particularly in the capital markets business, your comp down about $400 million compared to the first quarter or the quarter of last year. And obviously, what we've experienced generally is you holding the ratio reasonably steady for the second to third quarter and then truing up with a lower ratio in the fourth quarter. If I'm looking at the estimates we have for revenues on a well-known provider of data, we've got pretty flat revenues being forecast by people like me whether we're right or wrong. Should we be thinking about how you're going to build a bonus pool against this background and whether we should be looking at thinking or thinking that you're going to have to retain the comp ratio at a pretty similar level through the year if indeed we don't see any uptick in revenues and they remain reasonably flat?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the comp...","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd just use 32%.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Well, we've given the range 30% to 35%. We've been at the lower end of that range when we performed very strongly. We could drift up if we performed less strongly. We pay for performance, and I think we did a good job in the first quarter.","Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP","Okay, thanks.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have among the lowest ratios and we're paying our people properly as well.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And consistently.","Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP","Yeah. But I'm by no means arguing about the quality of the ratio. I'm just intrigued because clearly what we're seeing on most leaders and indeed in Europe is the difficulty of building a pool when you've been so used to having a very strong first quarter, obviously, makes it quite difficult.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, but...","Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP","Maybe just as a follow-up, which is vaguely related, could I just ask, what you talked earlier about where there's a question earlier about competition and picking up market share which indeed you clearly have. But one of the questions I perhaps just wanted to ask is an area you've been pushing hard on is equity, cash equities in particular. My sense is that actually a lot of the players including the Europeans who were doing massive restructurings are putting more capital into equities on the back of the fact that it's a lower capital business. And therefore they think they can get higher returns and just maybe that's why Nomura pulled out of European equities yesterday. What are you seeing in the equity space in particular because I don't \u2013 I'm not seeing as much sort of withdrawal as we have done in the fixed space?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that's very fair and we've talked about it pretty often that people when they restructure, they restructure out of the things that they were less strong at, less profitable at and in many cases they double down where they continue to have strength and we are seeing that and that's what we mean when we say there's always someone less to fiercely compete in every part of our business and equities is no exception, it's not the poster child for that. However, the equities business here at JPMorgan, we've rebuilt our technology platform. We have rebuilt the prime \u2013 when we built the prime brokerage international capabilities. The two of those work hand in glove, and we have every opportunity to continue to gain share and win.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we've done very well gaining share in electronic trading and the prime broker has been built in Asia and Europe where we had some weaknesses. So you've seen our share go up and we intend to win it. We have top-notch research, which obviously helps drive the equity business, too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Marianne, just as a follow-up, I just want to make sure I understood you correctly on the $500 million of incremental reserve build for energy for the remainder of the year, that's for the total of the following nine months. Is that correct?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I mean, give or take?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Give or take. And \u2013 that's right. Obviously, there's a high degree of variability around it. If we had complete ability to understand it, we would lean into those reserves, but there's a \u2013 it's name-specific. It's situation-specific. It would evolve over time. We just wanted to give you an indication that there's likely to be some more costs. It could be plus or minus quite a bit from that, because we've had to make some stress assumptions in there, but $500 million for nine months, yes.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you and then I know there was the energy-specific Shared National Credit exam that the first quarter results for the industry will reflect similar to your own. But we also have the traditional Shared National Credit exam that's been done for 20-plus years. Any color on how that's going, the normal Shared National Credit exam?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. No, Gerard, I'm not going to make any comments about SNC, except to say that everything that we know about SNC is reflected in our results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Two quick follow-ups, Marianne. I'm getting a couple of questions about just the math on the energy reserve ratio. I think you mentioned 6.3%. Just to be clear, is that the reserve for loans, over-funded loans, and then there's an additional reserve for unfunded commitments?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct, yes.","John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. And then could you tell us the size of your energy commitments and whether they've changed at all this quarter?","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They changed by a couple of billion dollars on a single name that we like. Up.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks very much.","Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, wait.

This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby.","At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.","Doug Braunstein","Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which as you know is available at our website and if you refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements in the back of the presentation, I will kick us off on Page 1.","We generated record net income of $5.7 billion, that\u2019s on record EPS of $1.40 per share for the quarter. That came on revenue of $25.9 billion, up 6% year-on-year, 13% quarter-on-quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 16% for the quarter and in the back you will see a return on Basel 1 risk-weighted assets was 1.7% for the quarter.","We characterize the business across all of our lines of business has strong performance this quarter and I want to quickly highlight upfront a few contributing factors we\u2019re going to talk about as we go through the presentation. First, we really had positive franchise trends in market share that we have been talking about for several quarters as we continue to invest in our businesses.","We maintained our #1 rank in year-to-date global ID fees, we had record deposits in CDB, record production revenue in the mortgage bank, sales volume of 11%, increase in Card, record revenue in the commercial bank, record assets under custody in TS&S.","Secondly, we saw positive year-over-year loan growth, although modest decline quarter-on-quarter; and that is despite the fact that we continue to experience the runoff from our various consumer portfolios we\u2019ve talked about. On a reported basis, total loans for the company were up 4% year-on-year; and if you look at core loan growth excluding the runoff portfolios, on a comparable basis to the presentation I did at the investor day, core loan growth was up 10% year-on-year. We have record loan balances in the CB up 15%, record business banking loan balances in CDB up 8%, record asset management loan balances of $75 billion.","Third theme you\u2019ll see is credit. We continue to see the same core trends in the past couple of quarters; consumer loan losses still very high by historical standards, continue to improve in both our real estate portfolios as well as Card and losses continue to remain very low in the wholesale side.","And then the last theme is strong capital generation for the company. We ended the quarter with a Tier 1 common of 135 billion, that\u2019s up 5 billion quarter-on-quarter, strong Basel 1 and Basel III ratios of 10.4% and 8.4% respectively. That estimate for Basel III of the 8.4% is post NPR and it compares to the 7.9% we recorded last quarter. I would also note we continue to work with the regulators on the implementation of the Basel 2.5 rules that were recently announced. And that\u2019s going to allow us to continue to refine our estimates as we go forward.","Finally, you see as we always do put a number of significant items up front here for the quarter. I\u2019m going to discuss these where relevant in the financials, but I also do want to remind you that there are, in addition to these larger items, there are always positives and negatives that run through the P&L. So for example, we didn\u2019t highlight the 200 million negative of DVA because it wasn\u2019t significant enough for us to highlight up front, despite the fact I just did.","If you move on to the businesses on Page 3 in the Investment Bank, we have circled net income of $1.6 billion for the third quarter. That\u2019s on revenues of $6.3 billion. If you take out the DVA, it was $6.5 billion in revenue for the quarter. That\u2019s up 45% year-on-year, 8% sequentially, $1.7 billion of net income and return on equity of 17%. IB fees for the quarter of $1.4 billion were up almost 40% year-on-year. We had particular strength this quarter in the debt issuance activity; given the favorable rate environment our clients are taking advantage of funding both going long and increasing their funding capacity.","Markets revenues of $4.8 billion were up 24% year-on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter. Very favorable performance in Fixed Income, up 33% year-on-year, 7% quarter-on-quarter. And we saw broad-based strength across the Fixed Income product set and particular improvement in our credit-related products this quarter.","Included in Fixed Income for the quarter, and going forward on a P&L basis, was the impact of the synthetic credit portfolio that we transferred to the IB at the very beginning of the third quarter; and I want to highlight three items here about the synthetic credit portfolio. The first is the IB did book a modest loss this quarter in the position, that\u2019s included in the $3.7 billion of revenues in Fixed Income. We did continue to reduce risk in that position this quarter. And you\u2019ll also see the IB bar for the quarter was $122 million; that did reflect the addition of the synthetic credit portfolio as well as a model change we implemented this quarter and then a reduction of the diversification benefits for this quarter as well.","If you look at equity, markets revenue of $1 billion, essentially flat year-on-year. Cash volumes continue to remain a challenge but it was offset by good results in equity derivatives as well as our Prime Services business. Last comment on the IB, if you look at the comp to revenue ratio x DVA, 32% for the quarter, 34% year-to-date.","If you turn to Page 5, Consumer and Business Banking, CBB, you see circled net income of about $780 million. That\u2019s on revenue of $4.3 billion, down 7% year-on-year. This will be the last quarter we talk about it on a year-over-year basis but it was impacted by the Durbin Amendment as well as the theme we\u2019ve been talking about of narrowing deposit margins. If you look quarter-on-quarter, excuse me, revenues were flat. And it really reflects those core-business trends that have been offsetting margin pressure. So the positive growth of 9%, we had a recent FDIC deposit survey that showed our deposit growth at several times the industry average. And the way we analyze that data it actually showed, we grew share in our consumer deposits in all of our 50 top markets this year.","The record business-banking balance is $18.6 billion. We opened over 1 million additional checking accounts year-over-year, 2.5 million more active-mobile customers. We continue to make progress on CPC. $155 billion of client investments under assets on the balance sheet and we opened our thousandth CPC location actually on October 1 so it did make it into the 9\/30 numbers.","And just a final word on expenses. Consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, you see expenses here were turned back to first-quarter levels. And you will continue to see overhead ratios remain elevated in the near-term given the rate environment.","If you turn to Mortgage Production and Servicing on Page 6, circled net income of a little over $560 million this quarter. Record production related pre-tax income of $1.1 billion in investment driven by a couple of items. Volumes were $47 billion this quarter up 30% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter, driven by the favorable rate environment for refinancing as well as HARP volume. You\u2019ll also see current margins really remained well above historical levels. We would expect those margins to compress over time.","Repurchase impact was essentially neutral for this quarter, similar to what we talked about last quarter. And then you\u2019ll see on the Servicing side, we continue to be challenged by very high default-related expenses including the foreclosure-related matters and the ongoing costs that are associated with the settlement and consent order. We do unfortunately expect these expenses to remain elevated longer and that is consistent with the general expense guidance that we gave you last quarter, certainly through the end of this year.","If you turn to Page 7 for real estate portfolios, you see net income of $60 million. Revenues are down 13%. That\u2019s the same theme we\u2019ve been talking about, decline in NII as we ran off $22 billion of loan balances in the portfolio, 11% reduction year-on-year. And we\u2019re going to continue to see this trend impacting our annual NII by about $500 million plus or minus. And this quarter was consistent with that.","Circled credit cost of $520 million on aged really reflects three items. First, we had a modest improvement in the credit-quality trends and that resulted in a $595 million charge-off number on a comparable basis to how we reported last quarter. As a result of that, going forward you will see our guidance for net charge-offs is $600 million plus or minus on a quarterly basis.","Second, we recognized an incremental $825 million of charge-offs we believe one time based on new regulatory guidance. And I\u2019m going to talk about that on the next page. And as a result of all of that, we reduced our reserves by $900 million this quarter, essentially reflecting our improved expectations for losses going forward.","We have included, by the way, reserve analysis that we discussed last quarter. It is on Page 20 of the appendix. And you\u2019ll see on an unadjusted basis, based on all of these actions, we continue to have a very healthy loan-loss reserve of 234% of our annualized net charge-offs on an adjusted basis.","If you turn to Page 8, we thought we\u2019d give you a little more description on the regulatory guidance. It essentially required that substantially all the loans that we have on our books discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy be written down to their collateral value. And that\u2019s regardless of the current delinquency status. So that impacted about $2.8 billion of mortgage balances, predominantly in home-equity loans.","And that\u2019s what added the $825 million in charge-offs for the quarter. I just want to highlight a couple facts we have on the page: 97% of those loans that we just wrote down to collateral value were current, 85% are actually paying principal, 50% have been making payments for at least two years following bankruptcy, 80% for one year, and 85% of the portfolio despite those scores has all improved since bankruptcy about 75 points on average.","If these loans perform the way we expect them to, we would expect to recover a significant amount of the current net charge-offs for this quarter over time. The guidance is a result of this action impacted on non-accrual loan balances, as did the previous regulatory guidance we implemented in the first quarter on junior liens. If you see at the bottom right, we tried to give you a pro forma trend analysis. And if you look at absent these changes, the circled number of 5.1 billion on non-accrual, that\u2019s the number to compare apples-to-apples to the third quarter of last year and so you see a reduction of a little over $1 billion in non-accrual balances.","Page 9, Card services and Auto, circled net income of $950 million, that\u2019s up 12% year-on-year. That\u2019s on revenues of $4.7 billion. It\u2019s down slightly year-on-year but up 4% quarter-on-quarter. I mentioned before we saw strong sales volume in Card. In fact, we have now had double-digit sales growth for the last seven quarters if you exclude the Kohl\u2019s portfolio. We continue to believe this is market share growth as we get a larger percentage of consumer spend and the United States.","The revenue rate you see on the page of 1246, based on strong interchange revenues and lower reversal this quarter and consistent with the guidance that Gordon had given you on investor day. Net charge off rate continued to decline, 357, that is down in absolute dollars, $380 million year-on-year. Just a quick moment on Auto, it had very solid performance originations up 7%, 9% quarter-on-quarter. That\u2019s really been based on the improving Auto environment as well as continuing strength in used car pricing.","Final note, on expenses, they are down 9% year-on-year and that\u2019s largely due to lower marketing costs. If you turn to Page 10, the Commercial Bank, circled net income was $690 million, that is, as I mentioned, on record revenues of $1.7 billion, driven by record loan balances. CNI growth for our portfolio continues to exceed the industry average.","It was 19% year-on-year versus a 13% industry average growth. Record million market loan balances now for the tenth consecutive quarter up 15% year-on-year. I will note, utilization continues to remain relatively flat. And given the strong cash positions on a number of our customers and the current environment, we are not sure that we haven\u2019t reached a new normal here in terms of utilization. The Credit environment continues to be very benign in the commercial bank and so excluding recoveries it\u2019s nine basis points of charge-offs this quarter.","Treasury and Security Services on page 11, net income of $420 million, that\u2019s up a little under 40% year-on-year but down on from a seasonally strong second quarter. Revenues are up 6% year-on-year and that is really the result of the higher deposit balances you see, particular growth by the way in international deposits and higher average trade finance loan volumes international trade loans grew almost 25% year-on-year. We also had record assets under custody during the quarter.","One note here on investment spending, as we continue to invest this is now beginning to be offset by some of the efficiency initiatives that we talked about in prior quarters so it actually reduced expenses year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter and the impact you see is improving margins year-over-year.","Asset management on page 12, $440 million of net income, up 15% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter. That\u2019s on revenues of $2.5 billion. The results of the quarter were really driven by the improving markets as well as the continuation of long-term product flows. You will see it is our 14th consecutive quarter of long-term flows, almost $21 billion this quarter. We\u2019ve had a little under $60 billion over the last 12 months into long-term portfolios. And that\u2019s really based on continued strong investment performance as well as the banker build-out we have been investing in. Loan growth, as I mentioned, is up almost $20 billion year-on-year. And that\u2019s really from increasing contributions from mortgage production as well as international.","If you turn to Page 13, Corporate and Private Equity, net income for the quarter totaled $220 million. It reflects really a number of things. So in Private Equity, you see net income loss of $90 million. That is principally mark-to-market positions for the quarter. In Treasury and CIO net income of $370 million, that\u2019s on revenues of $713 million. I\u2019m going to talk about that revenue in a number of items.","First, we had almost $900 million in revenues from the extinguishment of the gains on the redeemed trusts. We told you about that during our second quarter call.","If you, second, look to mark-to-market losses in CIO, it was a loss of $200 \u2013 approximately $250 million, and included in that loss was $450 million from a loss on the remaining index positions that we left in CIO. And that really reflects credit spread tightening that we had this quarter and you\u2019ll note that we effectively closed those positions out now by quarter end.","Third, we did recognize $460 million of pre-tax gains through securities gains, and in addition, while not on the page here, we did mention last quarter our AFS-related AOCI, so that\u2019s our security portfolio gains with $8 billion pre-tax, that number actually increased to $11 billion, a $3 billion increase on a pre-tax basis, $2 billion after taxes.","And then the final component here is we did book negative NII given the low rate environment. And given that environment and the reinvestment opportunities which I\u2019ll talk about on the NIM page, you would expect to see this line item be a loss of $300 million plus\/minus for next quarter, and that will obviously have an impact on NIM as well.","The last piece is other corporate here. We booked $700 million approximately in pre-tax costs for additional litigation reserves. And that was largely offset by a number of items including some tax adjustments this quarter.","So if you turn to Page 14 on NIM, you see that NIM declined four basis points quarter-on-quarter, our core NIM declined eight basis points quarter-on-quarter. And a number of items affecting NIM for the quarter on the negative side, prepayment speeds impacted the yields of the mortgage portfolio in our AFS portfolio. Secondly, as I mentioned, ongoing low rate environment and the impact on reinvestment opportunities impacted NIM as well as repricing of our floating rate instruments in that portfolio given the low rate environment. And then the third is really a mix issue. We increased our average deposits for Central Banks this quarter, primarily in the Fed, and that impacted NIM as well.","Now on the positive side, we did have a reduction in cost for deposits that were paid across our deposit-taking businesses this quarter. And the last note here is our long-term debt balances and interest expense were down on average quarter-on-quarter, but the long-term debt rate benefit that we got from repurchasing \u2013 redeeming the trusts was more than offset this quarter by the impact of accounting, primarily FAS 133 hedge in effect in this that we have talked about over a number of quarters.","And given all of what I just talked about going forward, and the current rate environment, we\u2019d expect to see continued modest pressure on NIM for the next several quarters. I think I\u2019ve covered the significant points on Page 15 and have talked about all the issues in terms of outlook on Page 16.","So with that, operator, can I ask you to open the lines for questions for Jamie and myself.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura","Hi. Thank you. Obviously great mortgage production. Curious if you can parse out how much related to HARP versus the overall rate environment? And if you think you have any visibility as we head into the fourth quarter and next year?","Jamie Dimon","So Refi was about 75% and HARP was about 15% in total. And next quarter will probably be pretty good because you still have low rates and the pipeline stuff is still pretty high, the applications.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura","Okay. Thank you. Same with the mortgage theme. I guess the overall message seems like, in your words, housing has turned and you lowered reserves a little bit. You\u2019ve got a lot more reserves to go. So what things do you look for, for that to continue? And is it apples and oranges when you look at the other side of the coin and see that repurchase claims are up, litigation reserves are up? And there has been a whole lot of press lately about some cases going against the industry or some court rulings going against the industry on the put-back side.","Jamie Dimon","Yeah, so, Glenn, maybe I can separate out. On the mortgage reserves side, we said in outlook is if the trends continue the way they are you should expect to see more reserve releases. But that is subject to the current trends. On the repurchase side, that data in the back of the supplement is both GSE and private label. So the trends we talked about last quarter on the GSE side have run through the mortgage lines continue. And so you saw our actual paid claims of 230, our reserve release I think of 218 if I\u2019m recalling correctly. We expect that, subject to obviously certain changes, to continue. And then on private label, we have told you based on what we knew that we thought we were well reserved for those issues but obviously circumstances can change. And that will change our reserve policy when and if appropriate.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura","Okay. Last quickie. Is there still about a 30 base-point delta for what you\u2019re showing us on the advanced approach on Basel III, Tier 1 common? And if you used the standardized?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah, so are you asking, the delta has shrunk. If you\u2019re asking \u2013 which we didn\u2019t put in the impact of the NPR on Basel I, that delta has shrunk as well.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura","Okay. Cool. I can follow the rest off-line.","Doug Braunstein","The only thing I want to say about capital, the 8.4% Basel III, which obviously is an estimate, up-front phases in everything that we know of today. It does not phase in what we know about our own runoff and create new models down the road to reduce it. So we would estimate if we did all that, we were close to 9-5.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura","Close to 9-5 ?","Doug Braunstein","In other words, we\u2019re phasing all of the bad stuff up-front and not any of the good stuff. The good stuff is the runoff that we know is going to happen in the next two years. And obviously there\u2019s no models to have better RWA outcomes on CRM and some other issues. It\u2019s just not in there yet.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura","And just a last one. On the re-submission, is that a November event for when we get thumbs-up, thumbs-down from the Fed?","Doug Braunstein","We don\u2019t know. They\u2019ll let us know. Remember this only affects the first quarter buy-back, which is not that substantial for our company. And we have to reapply for the full year CCAR, which would affect what we can do after March 31st, which we\u2019ll be doing soon. That\u2019s the more important number.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Question on just the reinvestment strategy. Doug, you mentioned going through Page 14 the challenges. The question is, do you at this stage continue re-investing in RMBS to the extent that you have the runoff occurring today? Obviously the front of the curve collapsed there on RMBS. Or do you go into more treasuries and Ginnie\u2019s given the fact that you are a little light on that asset class anyway? Relative spread has improved. Or do you loosen the credit box and try to drive up the loan growth?","Doug Braunstein","Well, number three definitely, which the loan growth is probably more important. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s loosening the credit box, it\u2019s maybe just being a little more competitive on pricing. Treasuries, no. And the benchmark for the reinvestment portfolio would be Fannie\u2019s or Ginnie\u2019s or Freddie\u2019s. But obviously there are issues to that about the convexity it creates when you do that. And the other thing, which we are obviously working through with new RWA, you\u2019ve got to combine liquidity need with the RWA charges. So right now we\u2019re staying fairly conservative. There will be other opportunities down the road.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And on the loan side, you think you can drive some incremental loan growth through just pricing activity? Just being more competitive on rate?","Jamie Dimon","I think Jumbo yes, just be more competitive on rates. And we think there are very good credits going forward. And you can see we are growing the Commercial Bank. We\u2019re growing Auto. Card, we hope to grow. We want to grow all those things. And we\u2019ve got good margins. We want to push the loan growth a little bit.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So then, switching gears, just talk a little bit about Thick. Thick\u2019s result were very good this quarter. The question on the outlook has to do with some of the structural changes that are going on as we move into next year, in particular clearing where there is some debate around collateral requirements, collateral shortfall, not going to be able to re-hypothecate as much going forward as you did, as you are able to right now. So how are you thinking about that Thick line? And what are you doing to try to maintain the kind of run rate that you\u2019ve got given those pressures?","Jamie Dimon","We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be a \u201ccollateral\u201d shortfall. It\u2019s not quite clear yet. And the rules for collateral for, I mean for liquidity stuff is not quite clear yet. Clearinghouses is both an opportunity and a risk. And so we hope to get, we\u2019re building the system so we can provide cross collateral for clients and ease of transaction and cheat-transactions for clients. Obviously it may change some of the volume to go through other things. But I\u2019m not sure in total that, that\u2019s going to change a lot in the Thick line. Our experience has been that things go to clearinghouses or during execution sometimes volume goes up and makes up for it.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. I\u2019m good. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group","Good morning. Jamie, I\u2019m really interested in getting your view on how you think QE3 overall is going to impact JPMorgan specifically. We can see, obviously, the short-term benefits of a lot of mortgage origination revenue potentially a positive impact on the economy. But, of course, the negative is lower mortgage rates, lower MBS rates and what that does to the margin. So I\u2019m interested in getting your view on is QE3 a good thing or bad thing for JPMorgan?","Jamie Dimon","You basically laid it out already which is lower rates you referred to a little bit. That obviously helped mortgage origination and ultimately housing prices because low rates can drive that part of the economy a little bit. If it were to drive the economy and I\u2019m not sure it will, that would be a plus for us. I think they are doing their job not to help things or hurt things but to try to drive the economy and drive jobs. If that works, it\u2019s a good plus. I personally think that the fiscal policy is going to be more important than the Fed policy soon. The Fed needs help with rational fiscal policy.","Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group","How do you think about this idea that in the near term clearly you are going to mint a lot of money on the mortgage refi boom, but once that\u2019s behind you, you are simply left with a lower margin. How much does that concern you or not?","Jamie Dimon","Not a lot. If you look at the margins in production are very high. They\u2019re well over 2%. A norm would be under 1%. So obviously one day that\u2019ll normalize. In the meantime you get volume and higher spreads. On the other hand, we have huge excess servicing costs, which probably would more than offset that. And when Housing recovers charges will come down. So to me if the economy gets better, we\u2019re fine. We may lose some production income, but everything else will be better.","Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group","And then finally, there\u2019s a lot of big banks that are sort of framing a component of their operating expenses that they think is abnormally high right now. Based on the extra mortgage servicing, the foreclosure, all things related to continuing through the end of this credit cycle. Is there any number or range that we should think about for JPMorgan in terms of those excess mortgage related costs coming down as Housing continues to recover?","Jamie Dimon","The big one to look at is the excess servicing costs due to the high level of default and high-cost default and consent orders and look at that number. It\u2019s about $500 million a quarter, a little more than that. That number will eventually be zero. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going down to zero, it\u2019ll probably take eight quarters before it goes down to a number approaching zero, maybe more. It\u2019s going to take a while to work through all of that. But, that number will disappear.","Production income will also come down at one point for all the reasons you said. When rates go back up you\u2019re not going to have all the refis we have today. And you\u2019ll probably have more competition and purchase money originations reducing margins. And obviously when the Housing recovers, the losses we are burying in charge-offs will reduce too, just owning the real estate portfolio.","Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up actually on that question from Ed in the eight-quarters that you indicated Jamie. Any idea that\u2019s actually a pretty \u2013 it\u2019s obviously an extended time period, any idea what the trend line would look like or is it too early? Is it going to \u2013 is most of the benefit that comes from that reduction going to be backend weighted or will it be pretty linear? Any idea about that?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah, I expect none the next quarter, I expect a little bit in 2013 and a lot in 2014. But those are just \u2013 I\u2019m just \u2013 this is just rough estimates. We don\u2019t really know.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Of course. Great. That helps. Thanks. And then the $700 million of litigation this quarter, does that mean that you guys had adverse development or was it largely one-time items there? I guess said another way, is there an adjustment from the previous views that litigation reserves really don\u2019t need to be built from this point?","Doug Braunstein","No. I think we\u2019re separating. When we talk about mortgage to private label stuff we said we felt we were substantially fairly well done. But there is other mortgage stuff that the goes in and out we adjust for and constant other litigation. So when we know we have something we can estimate what it is we put up litigation reserves for it. Unfortunately, I think litigation costs will stay high for a while too. There\u2019s just constant development in litigation, it\u2019s not all mortgage related.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then thinking about CCAR application, not just this quarter\u2019s but also next year\u2019s, are you approaching it any differently or is there any increased caution when you think about the fact that there was a material weakness of internal control at JPMorgan? I mean it seems like there might be something that could really sharpen the pencils at the regulators and so we\u2019re just curious as you approach the application whether or not that adjusted how you thought about your application at all?","Doug Braunstein","Listen, it\u2019s obvious we had a gap in the armor here. Like I said, an arrow went right through that gap. But other than that gap we think we have pretty damn good controls in stuff like that. That material weakness will be fixed. We have huge \u2013 we\u2019ve got a great company. We\u2019ve got huge cash flows, huge capability and we could probably buy back a lot of stock next year and still hit the 9.5% Basel III at one point. And so I think a rational thing to do is that the stock is at the right price to buy back stock. Obviously we will apply. We don\u2019t know the CCAR rules will change next year so when we see those rules we\u2019ll decide.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Yeah, early going, understood. I just was curious whether or not that was going to adjust to your approach at all.","Doug Braunstein","I would hope not. I would hope that when you look at the company in total you see pretty good disciplines and pretty good controls.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Fair enough. And then last one for me, I know that nothing is official but I don\u2019t know whether or not you or Doug might want to comment on the story in the Journal that got some attention yesterday about maybe different roles for Doug in the future or anything or who might be successor if Doug decided he wanted to do something different?","Doug Braunstein","Yeah, well, obviously, I find it truly irritating that people yatz the press like that. But Doug is a top professional. He ran our U.S. Investment Bank coverage for many years. He is a top CFO. We have no, we will let you know when and if we intend to make changes when we make them, not through gossip in the press. I should point out that we have a very strong bench in this company. We got a lot of talented people so if and when we make decision like that we\u2019ll make it. I also want to point out we always have conversations with senior people and everybody about the future for them; their career, what they want to do next, when the timing makes sense for them in the company. That\u2019s kind of a normal conversation. I would not put that as an abnormal type of conversation.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Fair enough. Actually one more, sorry. Trying to think about the implications of this announcement, the Bear suite, the Bear lawsuit that was announced. As I thought about it, wouldn\u2019t this if you have the ability to come after a firm that acquires a troubled financial institution at a time of crisis, after the fact, opportunistically, with perhaps political motivations, I mean shouldn\u2019t that raise concerns from a safety and soundness perspective from the fed? I mean isn\u2019t that kind of a key tool that the Fed uses in times of crisis? And shouldn\u2019t that sort of created an issue for this lawsuit?","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019m not sure it creates an issue for the lawsuit but I agree with you as a policy matter, it\u2019s going to make it much harder in the future for companies to buy a troubled company.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. Kind of following up on that a little bit, Jamie, you made some comments earlier in the week about kind of the ongoing costs of some of those, or the total costs, I should say, of some of those acquisitions. I would assume that some of the costs in the quarter, book litigation and otherwise, you\u2019re still kind of feeling that. Have you ever sized or are you willing to size what that might be?","Jamie Dimon","So let me further \u2013 I also want to mention when the government bankrupted GM, you do remember they did bankrupt GM, they absolved GM of all prior legal liability. So the government\u2019s being a little inconsistent here.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Clearly.","Jamie Dimon","So when I made a comment publicly on another forum that when we did Bear Stearns, remember we put up substantial reserves in purchase accounting. So it didn\u2019t run through the P&L for closedown costs, litigation, consolidation and materially risk management. Like we can get down the risk that we got in Bear Stearns. And so included in that number instead was what we did put in purchase accounting. Since then, we put on more reserves related to stuff. Some related to Bear Stearns, some related to WaMu, some related to JPMorgan Chase itself. And so it\u2019s increased the cost to us. And that\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s life. And we have reserved for the things we know about and we think about now. So it\u2019s in our numbers, the comments I\u2019m making. But we\u2019re not future looking at additional reserves.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. On a separate matter, the Card business had pretty strong revenues this quarter. Is there anything you can call out in terms of what drove that improvement? Is there something going on there? And can we expect that to continue?","Jamie Dimon","Well, first of all, the losses there are very low. And you shouldn\u2019t expect much improvement from year-to-year. There are historical lows. But what we are really proud of in the Card business is the new products from Sapphire, Freedom, Ink, products like Blueprint, our rewards programs, are doing very well. We\u2019ve been gaining share every single year for four years now on Card. And you see this spend numbers. Not the outstanding numbers but the spend.","So spend was up like 11%. And you compare that to a lot of competitors and that\u2019s more than double the growth of the average competitor. And that is obviously driving revenue. You also have a merchant process in there representing, if I remember correctly, 18% that\u2019s in the revenue line. So the Card business has been doing very well. If I\u2019m making up the years that they didn\u2019t do very well.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","And just a follow up, at the Investor Day, I think Gordon had mentioned that you expected kind of marketing spend to be kind of flattish in 2012. And I think Doug had alluded today saying that part of the reason costs were down was that marketing spend was down. Given that performance, is that something that you\u2019re going to start marketing more aggressively? Or is there just enough spending going on?","Jamie Dimon","Marketing was high last quarter and normal this quarter.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it.","Jamie Dimon","That\u2019s the way I look at it. But marketing to me is an investment in the future. So if we come up with plans, marketing plans, but we think they\u2019re going to have very good returns, we\u2019re going to spend the money. That\u2019s what we do. We don\u2019t sit here and set a marketing budget and meet it. We actually try to review all of the programs we have and when we have attractive things to do, we\u2019re going to do them, even if it reduces the current quarter profits.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor\u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","Jamie Dimon","Hi.","Matt O\u2019Connor\u2013 Deutsche Bank","You spoke a bit about getting more aggressive on loan pricing, in part because you feel better about the economy and part because of just the lower, flatter interest rates. But what do you need to see to lower lending standards a little bit, specifically on the Consumer side, as you think about Mortgage and Card and maybe even Auto?","Jamie Dimon","Can you repeat the question again?","Matt O\u2019Connor\u2013 Deutsche Bank","In short, what do you need to see either macro-wise in the economy or from a regulatory point of view to loosen some of the lending standards, which I think for the industry are quite high on the Consumer side?","Jamie Dimon","Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, so mortgage is high. Okay? And mortgage is high, appraisal stands are too high, the verification income is extreme. And that\u2019s since we don\u2019t know the rules of securitizations and secure M. I think it\u2019s going to loosen over time. I think doing mortgages today you get very good credits, very good underlying collateral. Remember, a lot of credits can\u2019t get loans today. It will lose over time. And I think you just need a stronger economy.","And some of these decisions, some of these regulatory rules, or even some of the Basel rules, could create kind of cliffs in mortgages so that the risk-weighted assets \u2013 I think if you go below 680 FICO, dramatically jumps. This should incent us not to do any mortgage below 680. And so I think some of those things, hopefully, will be sorted out in the next six months or nine months. And Credit Card, Auto, Student, and other, I think don\u2019t think you should expect to see major changes.","Matt O\u2019Connor\u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just separately, as we think about other levers because rates are to stay lower for longer, anything on the expense side that you\u2019re thinking about or could talk about?","Doug Braunstein","Yeah, we are doing budgets now and we\u2019re always drive efficiency and expenses and our expenses what I like about our expenses is in those numbers is constant investment. You see that, more bankers, more branches, more systems, more countries, more \u2013 that is what\u2019s important for driving the future of the company.","So obviously, we \u2013 some expense will be going up because they are good expenses and the bad \u2013 and some expenses are coming down to become more efficient and we\u2019re always trying to drive down what I call bad expenses. Expenses driven by bureaucracy, stupidity and stuff like that so we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019ll fine tune it and when we have investor day next year we\u2019ll probably give you a better outlook for what we expect. But right now an expectation would be kind of level, the plus, what we can save will offset the investments.","Matt O\u2019Connor\u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just lastly on some of the servicing related cost, I realize there is a lot of puts and takes, I often get asked the question home prices are starting to go up. How quickly do these costs come down? And obviously the time to foreclose is actually increasing I think versus six, nine months ago. What\u2019s the one or two key macros data points that we can watch to be somewhat of a leading or even coincidence indicator for these servicing costs?","Doug Braunstein","Okay. So in servicing, it $5 million a quarter which will eventually go to zero and the real driver of that is things in default, delinquency or foreclosure. As those things come down, you\u2019re going to see those costs come down. And second, we have to finish the consent order in that but I think they\u2019re all kind of related. In real estate, home prices going up will reduce real estate losses or jobs reduced real estate losses. The number of homes underwater is two million less now than it was like a year ago. So obviously those things are all big pluses. I think you just need a good economy and you\u2019ll see charge-offs start to come down more \u2013 faster than they have been coming down recently.","Matt O\u2019Connor\u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Hi. Good morning.","Jamie Dimon","Good morning.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","First question is what is the loan utilization this quarter versus last three quarters?","Jamie Dimon","You guys, can you turn up your \u2013 Mike I can\u2019t hear you Doug.","Doug Braunstein","You can\u2019t hear me?","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019m sorry.","Doug Braunstein","Can you hear me now, Jamie?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah, we got you.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Yeah, okay. So what\u2019s \u2013 yeah, go ahead.","Jamie Dimon","So, Mike, it\u2019s loan utilization in the commercial bank.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","However you can give it to us.","Jamie Dimon","We typically talk about utilization in the commercial bank particularly in the middle market. It is in the low 30s and it hasn\u2019t changed much. And I mentioned that\u2019s because most of those companies are very flush with cash as well. So, until they start to really invest more you\u2019re going to see those utilization rates around where they are.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay. And your margin guidance, it seems a little bit worse than before. Is that simply due to QE#3?","Doug Braunstein","Our NIM guidance is largely identical to what we said last quarter. Modest pressure.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","But you say for a few more quarters it seems like it\u2019s pressure for longer or no?","Doug Braunstein","It could be because the implied curve has pushed lower rates out much longer so the pressure can go on a little bit longer than we would have thought before.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","And...","Doug Braunstein","But Mike remember that also relates to decisions we are going to make. How long the duration of our portfolio is, what we do in making loans, how we want to manage the risk-weighted assets. So there\u2019s been a lot of changes in the business, we\u2019ve got to adjust of those changes.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","And part of that adjustment is that being more competitive on pricing for loans?","Jamie Dimon","I would say competitive but not necessarily more competitive. So we try to stay competitive in most pricing, you know get under \u2013 due to credit right and being competitive on price is more important than beat competitive pricing but I mean don\u2019t be competitive prices but have bad underlying credit standards.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","So are you lowering pricing on your loans?","Jamie Dimon","On home equity \u2013 on jumbo loans we did a little bit. Mostly on...","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","And what about...","Jamie Dimon","Most of the loans probably not.","Doug Braunstein","Yeah, Mike, I will tell you in the NIM this quarter, if you look at the loan yields, relatively flat across the company. But again, as the environment, low rate environment and people looking for assets to put on the balance sheet we\u2019re going to have to remain competitive.","Jamie Dimon","Actually In the jumbo I would say, actually we just reduced rates to meet the market. We were probably a little high.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","I guess what I\u2019m leading to is half elastic is loan pricing. I mean if you assume that the lack of loan growth in aggregate for the U.S. is not due to the supply of money but is due to the demand for money, will lowering pricing actually improve that demand? And I know it\u2019s a difficult question to answer but it goes to how much lower you might want to price your loans.","Jamie Dimon","We are not going to price a lot lower to create demand or something like that. No. I think it\u2019s a little elastic. We see the elastic in Jumbo. We\u2019re not going to change our underwriting standards in Card. We\u2019re not going to change our underwriting standards in Pricing. We got a little more competitive in Auto. But, again, that\u2019s just following the business. These are competitive businesses and we have to compete. We have to decide if we\u2019re going to meet lower prices or not. So in Auto and Jumbo we did. I would say that in the Commercial Corporate side, probably not much.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","And then one more question on the margin as it relates to mortgage. I know this is a tough question. How much longer do you think the mortgage margin should hold up in terms of the gain on sale? Or what factors should we think about when modeling that?","Jamie Dimon","I think as long as rates stay low, refis will stay high. And volume will be high. And very high volume clogs up the system and allows higher pricing. I think that once you start to see rates go up, which I personally think will probably happen sometime in 2013, but I don\u2019t know that. You\u2019re going to see lower refi and more competitive pricing, more home purchase but more competitive pricing. We don\u2019t expect to count in the high margins and mortgage origination forever. Maybe you\u2019re going to have it next quarter or maybe for a couple quarters after that but it won\u2019t last for that much longer.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning. Jamie, first maybe a pretty big picture question, given that we are heading towards the fiscal cliff by the end of the year, what is your outlook particularly in the Investment Bank and in the Commercial Banking segments for the fourth quarter and into the first half of next year, given some of the political risks that we face over the next few months?","Jamie Dimon","When you talk about the fourth quarter, it\u2019s only the Commercial Bank. You can pretty much project the results for the next quarter. So the fiscal cliff isn\u2019t going to change this, and I hide loans in the books and from treasury deposits and things like that. The investment bank would be more sensitive to what the market reacts to if they get very scared about the fiscal cliff. But we just don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to be prepared. JPMorgan will try to be there for clients regardless. And I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to drive the fourth quarter results that much. I think the only place you will see it really drive it would be in the Investment Bank because volume has dropped dramatically. But I can give you arguments why fiscal cliff could drive volumes up in the short run.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo","Doug, maybe a question for you on the Investment Banking bar, which was on a reported basis up about 70% plus. There appears to be a methodology change in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Can you provide a little more detail as to how we should think about that? And what you are thinking about the bar in the fourth quarter?","Doug Braunstein","Yes, so, as you say, much of that increase was a transfer of the Synthetic Credit portfolio which we expected some other mix changes. The model changes, we updated models for that portfolio based on Investment Banking models, which we believe are a better indicator of risk. And there were a little less diversification benefits this quarter. These bar numbers are well within the numbers that the IB has operated in before. And we did, I think, qualify at a company-wide level the impact of the model change, our reduced bar company-wide by a little over $35 million.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then a question on your deposit costs. They\u2019re down about six basis points, quarter-over-quarter as you mentioned, Doug, in your prepared remarks. One side of the question is how much lower do you think you can get those? And if you\u2019re not able to drive those down, what affect does that have on NIM pressure over the next couple of quarters?","Doug Braunstein","It\u2019s likely we\u2019re getting close to the bottom there. And so to the extent other factors continue to have pressure, you\u2019re going to see a little bit more flippage. I will say some offsets that we didn\u2019t get the benefit of from a hedge accounting standpoint is our financing costs. We would expect to see some improvements there absent the account changes.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then finally from me, you noted that peripheral European exposure on a net basis was a little less than $12 billion this quarter versus a $6.3 billion net number last quarter. It looks like most of the increase came in at Italy and Spain. Is there any color you can provide on what\u2019s going on there?","Jamie Dimon","The increase is mostly from the reduction in short positions at a synthetic credit portfolio.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks very much.","Jamie Dimon","The rest is kind of business-as-usual in Italy and Spain. We are still doing business there.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay.","Jamie Dimon","You should see that exposure go up a little bit in the near-term too.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erica Panella with Bank of America.","Erica Panella \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning. I just had one follow-up question to Brian\u2019s question. So, Jamie, you\u2019re entering this stress test in 2013 with more capital and more earnings than you did for the 2012 CCAR. And you also mentioned that it will be business as usual in terms of how you formulate your ask. So if the synthetic credit loss is really going to impact the process in your ask, is it safe for us to assume that you will ask for at least as much as you did last year if not more?","Jamie Dimon","First, we don\u2019t have the final CCAR rules yet. And they\u2019re going to change some of them and we\u2019ve got to see that before we see it. And we\u2019re also working through all of the new RWA rules of Basel 2.5, the NPR Basel III, and all the new liquidity rules elsewhere. We\u2019re going to get it all right and then we\u2019re going to apply. I think we\u2019re going to buy back a substantial amount of stock and meet the 9.5% Basel III in 2013, by late 2013. But I can\u2019t give you the number right now. It may be more or less than last year what we applied for.","Erica Panella \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of is Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","Yeah, thank you very much. Jamie, going back to mortgage originations on the correspondence channel you\u2019ve really been increasing market share. Is that something \u2013 I know there is a lot of opportunity out there with a lot of guys exiting that business. And I know in the past that you\u2019ve shrunk that a little bit. But is that something that we should continue to see if the mark-to-market remains healthy to grow market share on that channel?","Jamie Dimon","I think we did shrink it. Again, I\u2019ve got the number 2,500 down to 700 or 800. We are looking at the complete relationship in correspondence. The correspondence I think is a pure economic transaction. Other people get out of the business and we\u2019ve probably just ended up with a little more share for that reason. It\u2019s not a big strategic thrust. If the Morgan folks come in and say that they can generate a lot of servicing and a great economic rate and do more, we would do more.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","Okay. And then another question is you saw Wells Fargo get hit with the Department of Justice suit on FHA originations. And I know there\u2019s been a lot of litigation to all these institutions. Have you had any talks with the Department of Justice on what \u2013 I know B of A has settled with these guys with the same issues. Have you had any thoughts that have been disclosed? Any talks with the Department of Justice on these FHA-type originations?","Jamie Dimon","We haven\u2019t disclosed anything but I would expect when these things come out everyone\u2019s going to have to have something of the same order. This is a new ordinary course of business. But it\u2019s unlikely that you have three people get it and not the fourth.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","And then lastly, you talked about...","Jamie Dimon","But we were not very big in FHA.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","Yeah, okay. And then the other last one is, you talked about \u2013 Mike or Mary asked, I forget who \u2013 that you don\u2019t see anybody really doing FICOs below 680. Is that just putting on your portfolio? Or 680 and selling to the GSEs? I mean we know that...","Jamie Dimon","Conforming loans, you sell them, that\u2019s fine. You meet their standards. What I was referring to is that some of the new Basel rules create these little cliffs on risk-weighted assets. And if I remember correctly, one of the cliffs is created when you go below 700 or 680 or 650. And that therefore it\u2019s going to be harder for certain people to own mortgages even if they are very well underwritten, even 60% loan-to-value is below 680 because of the high risk-weighted-capital charge. I think some of that is stifling mortgage origination to those folks. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. And I think it should loosen up over time. And I\u2019m not sure the regulators intended that when they put out the new Basel rules.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","Okay. Thank you very much, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW.","David Konrad \u2013 KBW","Good morning. I just had a question regarding the comp ratio and IB. It came in at least lower than I expected at 32%. I guess is that a mix shift in the revenues this quarter? And maybe if you can give any color for next quarter, maybe I was thinking the long-term, comp-ratio guidance was 35% to 39%. Should we think of that is being lower and longer-term?","Jamie Dimon","Yeah, we\u2019ve always said 35% to 40%. We actually use a formula which uses returns on capital and the types of revenues and the types of profits, et cetera. Risk-adjusted and all that. So that\u2019s the number that generally goes through. But as a rule of thumb I would think about the 35% being a good number.","David Konrad \u2013 KBW","Okay. Thank you.","Jamie Dimon","Obviously every year it changes. Competition changes. Whether you are investing in certain parts of the world, you may fund that separately because you can\u2019t take that out of people working hard today to fund a big investment in another part of the world. So it\u2019ll change over time that 35%. If you look at our investment bank 35% comp I think it\u2019s like 25% non-comp, which means a 40% margin. That\u2019s pretty good. That\u2019s pretty good. If we can sustain that, I would be a very happy guy.","David Konrad \u2013 KBW","Great. Thank you.","Jamie Dimon","In a competitive environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christoph Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Christoph Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer","Hi. Jamie was quoted the other day saying that JPMorgan was establishing a fiscal cliff war wound. I was wondering if you could tell us exactly what you meant by that and how you are positioning the firm for that?","Jamie Dimon","I think I was referring to, I was asked a question at the Council Correlations about the Eurozone crisis and the fiscal cliff. We do have a kind of war wound Eurozone crisis. We\u2019ve done extension work on it. I also mentioned we probably spent $50 million or so getting prepared for the debt crisis that we had nine months ago or so. We are preparing, I wouldn\u2019t call it war wound, I misstated it, we\u2019ve got to get prepared for the fiscal cliff. What does that mean? It may be not so much for us but for our clients. How are they going to react What do we have to be prepared to do And unfortunately, when things like a fiscal, if the fiscal actually happens you have to be prepared for various scenarios including the worst possible one, even if you don\u2019t predict it. That\u2019s what we are thinking. What could really happen? What are we missing? How bad could it be? We have to be prepared for it. Were hoping it doesn\u2019t happen.","Christoph Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Good morning. Two questions, one on what\u2019s left of what you\u2019d transferred. You closed out positions in CIO and transferred the rest to the Investment Bank. Can you give us any update on your thoughts on when that could be completely exited? And any other indications of size or impact in the quarter would be great.","Doug Braunstein","Last time we gave you some measures of CS01, VaR, RWA and a couple of stress tests. We said extreme stress 800 to 1.6 billion. That was July 13. Almost any measure you look at of risk would be down 20%, 30% or 40%. Certain risks are down 40%. Certain risks are down 30%, certain 20%. And the stress risk in addition is down by that amount. The folks are doing a great job managing it. It had a modest loss this quarter. We feel completely comfortable with it. It obviously can lose money. It can also make money. And we always said we hope at the end of the year it\u2019s a non-issue we don\u2019t have to talk about anymore. We\u2019re still on track for that.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","And so it seems like it\u2019s reasonably well hedged in the Investment Bank.","Doug Braunstein","The folks are doing a great job hedging every conceivable piece of it they know about while conducting client business.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Right. Okay maybe a follow-up on Europe, certainly the funding environment has gotten better, do you feel that there has been somewhat of a game change there? And are you feeling better about embracing market share opportunities there and putting more balance sheet to work? Or do you still have some hesitation in Europe?","Doug Braunstein","In the last couple months they have made, I would say, a lot of progress if you look at the OMT even though it has conditions but it is a big statement to make sovereign debt good for Italy and Spain. The conversations about the banking union in guaranteed programs, which would protect from a run in the banks in Spain and Italy, and also trying to redo this fiscal, it could take years, but the fiscal agreement among the Eurozone nations. I think they have made a lot of progress. You see it reflected in bond rates. I still think it\u2019s going to be a roller coaster. There will be ups and downs as good things happen or bad things happen. They are only in a mild recession. I think that\u2019s a very good thing. We have always made a decision to continue to conduct business in France and Germany and U.K. and Spain and Italy. So we continue to be worried about it. We are going to be prepared for bad outcomes but we are there. And if there are opportunities, we have not seen unbelievable opportunities like asset sales or something like that, but we will participate if there are assets we want or things we want to do.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Right. So you think the tone of the improved tone in September is sort of carrying so far into the fourth quarter?","Doug Braunstein","I hope so. We don\u2019t run the company guessing on things like that. We\u2019re trying to build our client business. I hope so. I hope they continue to make progress. That\u2019s always good. We\u2019re prepared if that\u2019s not true too.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay. Great. I\u2019m done. Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing comments?","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019m just surprised no one mentioned how handsome Doug Braunstein looked in the article in the Wall Street Journal.","Doug Braunstein","On that final note, thank you all very much.","Jamie Dimon","Thank you, folks.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.","Jennifer Piepszak","Thank you Operator, and good morning everyone. Before I get started, I\u2019d like to thank Marianne for nearly seven years as CFO and for her support of me over many years, but particularly her support during my transition into this role, so a huge thanks to Marianne.","Jamie Dimon","Yes, I just want to add my thanks too. I think Marianne, as we all know, did a great job - smart, honest, thoughtful, helped make the company a better company, so all our thanks goes to Marianne. We also all know that Jennifer is going to do a great job, too.","Jennifer Piepszak","Thank you, Jamie. Okay, so now on to the presentation, which as always is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","Starting on Page 1, the firm reported record net income of $9.7 billion and EPS of $2.82 on revenue of $29.6 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 20%. Included in these results are tax benefits of $768 million related to the resolution of a number of tax audits. Adjusting for this as well as a few other notable items that largely offset, we delivered an 18% ROTCE this quarter.","Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding; number one in global IBCs year-to-date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the commercial bank with net income of $1 billion while continuing to invest in the business; and in asset and wealth management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets.","Overall for the firm, total loan growth was 2% year-on-year but down 1% sequentially. It\u2019s important to note here that these variances include the impact of loan sales in home lending as we continue to optimize our usage of capital and liquidity across the firm. Credit performance remained strong across businesses and we delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage.","Now on to Page 2 and some more detail about our second quarter results. Revenue of $29.6 billion was up $1.2 billion or 4% year-on-year as net interest income was up approximately $900 million or 7% on balance sheet growth and mix, as well as higher rates. Non-interest revenue was up approximately $300 million year-on-year, largely driven by the absence of the card rewards liability adjustment we took in the prior year. Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, non-interest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease, home lending production, and consumer and business banking, offset by lower markets revenue and IBCs as previously guided. ","Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately $250 million. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.1 billion down 5% year-on-year. In consumer, credit costs of $1.1 billion were flat as higher net charge-offs were offset by net reserve releases. And in wholesale, credit performance remained favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters. Once again, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale. ","Now on to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the second quarter with a CET-1 ratio of 12.2%, up more than 10 basis points versus last quarter. In the quarter, the firm distributed $7.5 billion of capital to shareholders, and as you know, the Fed did not object to our 2019 CCAR capital plan. We are pleased to have significant flexibility with gross repurchase capacity of up to $29.4 billion over the next four quarters, and the board announced its intention to increase the common dividend to $0.90 per share, effective in the third quarter.","Now on to Page 4 and consumer and community banking. CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31%. Loans were down slightly year-on-year driven by home lending down 7%, reflecting the loan sales I just mentioned; however, card loan growth was healthy, up 8%. Business banking loans were up 2%, and auto loans and leases were flat. We saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 16%, growing across both physical and digital channels. Card sales were up 11% as growth remained strong across key products. Across the franchise, active mobile users were up 12% year-on-year given continued engagement in our new features. For example, customers have opened over 2 million checking and savings accounts digitally, activated over 60 million Chase offers, and our enrollment in credit journey now exceeds 18 million.","Revenue of $13.8 billion was up 11%. This increase included two notable items that largely offset. First, the current quarter included a negative MSR adjustment in home lending driven by updates to our model inputs; and in the prior year, as I mentioned, we had a rewards liability adjustment in cards of approximately $330 million. ","Consumer and business banking was up 11% on higher deposit NII, driven by margin expansion. Home lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances.","In cards, merchant services and auto was up 18%. Excluding the previously noted rewards liability adjustment, revenue was up 11% driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and the impact of higher auto lease volumes. ","Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 4% driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. Of note, the overhead ratio was 52% and we delivered significant positive operating leverage. ","On credit, this quarter included a reserve release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $400 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in cards of $200 million. This was primarily driven by growth, and to a lesser extent mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio.","Net charge-offs were up $212 million. Excluding the recovery on a loan sale and home lending in the prior year, net charge-offs were up $80 million driven by card, as we continue to grow the portfolio. ","Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 5, CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.6 billion. As a reminder, our performance was particularly strong last year, which featured record or near-record revenues in overall IBCs and equity markets. With that in mind for the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 billion was down 9% year-on-year in a market that was also down. Advisory, debt underwriting, and equity underwriting fees were down 15%, 13% and 11% respectively, reflecting lower levels of deal activity as well as a 10-year record share in equity underwriting in the prior year.","It\u2019s worth noting on a year-to-date basis, we continue to rank number one overall and have gained share across all products and regions, benefiting from our continued investment in bankers. ","In advisory, we grew share in announced deal volumes and announced more deals than any other bank. In debt underwriting, we also rank number one, benefiting from our strong lead [indiscernible] position in leveraged finance, and in equity underwriting we have seen significant pick-up in activity since the first quarter and we continue to benefit from our leadership positions in tech and healthcare, where there has been robust activity.","Looking forward, the overall IB pipeline is healthy, though lower compared to the elevated activity we saw last year and with fewer acquisition financing and lease financing opportunities in debt underwriting. Dialog with clients remains active and we expect strong deal flow to continue. ","Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.4 billion, which was flat year-on-year. Our results include a notable gain in fixed income from the IPO of Tradewind. Excluding this gain, markets revenue would have been down 6% year-on-year against strong second quarter performance last year. ","Fixed income markets were down 3% on an adjusted basis with relative weakness in EMEA partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading, due to the changing rate environment. Equity markets was down 12% against a record second quarter last year. [Indiscernible] client activity and a tough compare contributed to a year-on-year decline in equity derivatives; that said, cash in prime remained stable with client balances in prime reaching an all-time high. Treasury services and security services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, down 4% and 5% year-on-year respectively, with organic growth being more than offset by deposit margin compression.","As a reminder, similar to last quarter, deposit margin was primarily impacted by funding basis compression rather than client betas, and at the firm-wide level there is an offset. ","Sequentially, treasury services was flat and security services was up 3% on higher balances and fees. Finally, expenses of $5.5 billion were up 2% compared to the prior year with higher legal expenses partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. The comps revenue ratio for the quarter was 28%.","Now moving onto commercial banking on Page 6. Commercial banking reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 5% year-on-year predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances. Also worth noting here, gross IB revenue of $1.4 billion was up 8% year-to-date on strong syndicated lending and M&A advisory activity, and we continue to progress solidly toward our long-term $3 billion target.","Deposit balances were down 1% year-on-year and importantly up 1% sequentially as balances have largely stabilized in total, although we continue to see migration to from non-interest to interest-bearing deposits. Expenses of $864 million were up 2% year-on-year driven by ongoing investments in banker coverage and technology. Loans were at 1% with C&I loans being flat, or up 3% adjusted for the continued run-off in our tax-exempt portfolio. The story here remains unchanged - we saw solid growth in areas where we\u2019ve been investing, including expansion markets in specialized industries, offset by lower acquisition-related and short-term financing activities. ","CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending, where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective, given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $29 million with a net charge-off rate of 3 basis points.","Now onto asset and wealth management on Page 7. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $719 million with pre-tax margin and ROE of 27%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market leverage was offset by lower investment valuation gains. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees. For the quarter, we saw record net long-term inflows of $36 billion driven by fixed income, and we had net liquidity inflows of $4 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, both records, were up 7% driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels globally. Deposits were up 2% sequentially and up 1% year-on-year, and similar to the commercial bank, balances in total have largely stabilized. Finally, we had record loan balances up 7%, with strength on both wholesale and mortgage lending.","Now onto corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $828 million, including the vast majority of the tax benefits that I mentioned earlier. Revenue was $322 million, up $242 million year-on-year due to higher net interest income driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year. Expenses of $232 million were down $47 million year-on-year.","Finally turning to Page 9 and the outlook, on this page I\u2019ll just comment on NII, which should not be surprising given the changes to the rate environment. As you can see, we are updating our 2019 full-year NII outlook to about $57.5 billion. The reduction is based on multiple scenarios which assume, among other things, lower long end rates and up to three rate cuts this year, which is consistent with current market sentiment. As a reminder, this compares to a rate scenario that assumed zero cuts at the time of first quarter earnings. ","To wrap up, the U.S. consumer remains healthy, overall credit is in great shape, and the earnings power of the company is evident. We delivered strong returns this quarter and the diversification and scale of our business model positions us well to outperform in any environment. Understanding there is some macro uncertainty and potential headwinds from the rate outlook, we still expect to grow the franchise and will continue to strategically invest in our businesses in technology, bankers and beyond.","With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. ","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. I noticed that card loan growth was particularly strong this quarter. I just wanted to get a sense as to what you feel is driving that uptick, and do you think how sustainable is it at sort of 8% year-over-year growth.","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure, so on card loan growth, we feel very good about what we\u2019re seeing there. As we talked about at investor day, we have a real opportunity with our existing customers, and we talked about how our existing customers have about $250 billion of borrowing off us. About $100 billion of that is squarely within our existing buyback, so you can think of this as highly targeted to high quality existing customers, and for the first time, we\u2019re actually seeing loan growth in cards as the majority of it coming from existing customers versus new customers, and so we\u2019re really shifting the paradigm there and we feel great about being able to harvest the opportunity that we talked to you about at investor day.","Jim Mitchell","Should we expect just sort of you to continue to reduce the mortgage footprint in this rate environment?","Jennifer Piepszak","On the mortgage business, I would say it was a good quarter on the back of the rally, and so we did see volumes increase and we saw some margin expansion as well, and so obviously highly rate dependent but I would say the structural challenges in that business remain unchanged. And so, we continue to focus on optimizing the balance sheet across capital and liquidity and so looking at loan sales and thinking about de-risking the portfolio from a servicing perspective, so good quarter on the back of the rally but it doesn\u2019t change the overall structural challenges. ","Jim Mitchell","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to go back to what you were saying earlier in that your guide--or your guide lower is including up to three rate cuts this year, which would suggest to me that your net interest income is quite defensive in the face of rate cuts. I guess my first question is, could you give us your primary assumption for that $500 million swing, particularly on deposit pricing?","Jennifer Piepszak","Okay, sure. First of all, I\u2019ll take you back to the first quarter where our guidance was $58 billion-plus, and we talked about some pressure on the long end at that point. That pressure has persisted and in fact increased, and so we pulled the impact of the long end through in terms of our outlook, and then on the short end the range of outcomes are obviously quite broad, and so we thought about a range of outcomes of one to three rate cuts, and so you can think about -- if it\u2019s one cut, $57.5 billion-plus, and if it\u2019s more, $57.5 billion-minus. Then based on current advice, you can think about the third quarter as being $100 million to $150 million below the second quarter, and then a bit more than that in the fourth quarter given we would have a full quarter at that point.","Then in terms of betas, largely speaking you can think of betas as being symmetric, and so on the consumer side we saw little re-price on the way up, and so there is not a lot of opportunity on the way down. On the wholesale side, if you look at large institutional businesses like treasury services and security services, we are largely at full re-price there, so there should be opportunity there. Then in places like the commercial bank and asset and wealth management, we are still ahead of what the model would have assumed, but we have started to see re-price tick up there. But importantly, I would say we\u2019re not going to lose any valuable customer relationships over a few ticks of beta, and so we\u2019ll see how it goes.","Jamie Dimon","And it\u2019s all embedded in your assumptions.","Jennifer Piepszak","And it\u2019s all embedded in the [indiscernible].","Erika Najarian","Got it. Just going back to Jim\u2019s question, I noticed that investment securities balances continued to go up and mortgage loans were down another 5%. Should we think about this as part of the overall, you were saying optimizing capital and liquidity and therefore as we think about it going forward, we could also expect to see perhaps some relief in RWA growth and some relief in the continued reserve release as part of the optimization?","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure, so on the RWA side, yes, that is precisely why we\u2019re doing it, and so when you see the loan sales in home lending, yes, they are offset in securities purchases which are more efficient from a capital perspective, as well as a liquidity perspective, so yes.","Having said that, on reserves - I mean, reserves are not necessarily going to be impacted directly by that, because of course that will depend upon the environment and the mix of the portfolio that remains.","Jamie Dimon","I would just add, our standardized capital ratio is 12.2, advance is 13. Advance is obviously a far more important relevant economic number. It simply does not make sense to own all mortgages when you can frame by standardizing and you can\u2019t securitize.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. ","Mike Mayo","Hi. The efficiency ratio went from 56% to 55% year-over-year, and I guess that\u2019s with some accelerated tech spending, so do you plan to keep this pace of tech spending going, and what\u2019s the current update on that tech spending? Where is it connecting, where is it not connecting, because I think you said you\u2019d accelerate it for a couple years and then maybe we\u2019d see more of the results in 2020, 2021.","Jamie Dimon","Could I just take that one? It\u2019s about $11.5 billion today, I think it was a little bit lower last year. If we had to say what it is today for next year, it\u2019d be something like $11.5 billion, and I think it\u2019s always becoming more efficient, but what you really have in tech is some things are becoming cheaper all the time and then you\u2019re also investing money all the time, which we\u2019re going to do regardless of the environment, so we\u2019re not going to cut things we\u2019re trying to build, like My Rewards programs and Chase My Loan and the credit journey because there\u2019s a recession or something like that. Daniel Gordon will tell you right now that they think they get more efficient spend, and we shouldn\u2019t [indiscernible] whatever you want, but we will be happy to spend to win in this business, and we\u2019re very efficient, [indiscernible] how we spend in technology. We\u2019re going to do it regardless of the environment, and we\u2019ll probably get more efficient in tech spend too. ","Jennifer Piepszak","That\u2019s right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest, and we talked a lot about AI and machine learning - it\u2019s early innings there and there\u2019s a lot that we\u2019re going to be able to do to invest there and become more productive, and then cloud, developers can become more productive using the cloud.","Jamie Dimon","It\u2019s amazing - our [indiscernible] costs with all the things going on in the world today are down because effectively of AI and [indiscernible] and stuff like that, and so it\u2019s hard to [indiscernible]. You mentioned You Invest, you look at our client investment assets grew 16%, a portion of that was You Invest, and obviously You Invest cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build, so you\u2019ve got to put all those things in perspective about how you start making decisions going forward.","Mike Mayo","Then a follow-up, Jamie, you mentioned the environment, all the things taking place in the world. How is the environment now? I mean, on the one hand you have a trade war, you have lower interest rates, you have capital markets which are down to the big banks, you have a lot of pessimism; on the other hand, you highlighted your results. When you take the temperature of the environment, what\u2019s the temperature?","Jamie Dimon","It\u2019s not that bad. You know, uncertainty is a constant. The one thing in life is you know it\u2019s going to be uncertain going forward, and geopolitical tension is kind of a constant. Those things may be a little bit higher now than normal, but what I think we see is global growth is north of 3%, you kind of expect the United States to be 2.5% this year. The consumer in the United States is doing fine, business sentiment is a little bit worse mostly probably driven by the trade war. You travel around the world, you know, Japan is growing and Europe is growing a little bit, and Brazil has gone from negative-4 to zero. A lot of countries have opportunity to expand. They don\u2019t have to be great but they should be doing better [indiscernible], so I wouldn\u2019t get too pessimistic yet. ","Obviously the Fed will react to the data they see, and I would say it\u2019s more important what\u2019s going on that just what the Fed does. If the Fed\u2019s cutting rates and we\u2019re going to recession, that\u2019s not a good rate cut. IF the Fed actually raises rates one day and we\u2019re booming, that\u2019s not so bad. ","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. ","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it, but I think total average loans were up 2% year-on-year, but that was impacted by the loan sales. Can you tell us either size of loan sales or what average loan growth was up year-on-year without that?","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes, there\u2019s a few things going on in loan growth, as you say, Glenn. We have the loan sales, we also have the run-off of the tax exempt portfolio, so you can think about loan growth probably closer to 4% if you adjust for those items. Importantly, as we always say, loan growth is an outcome, not an input, and we feel good about the loan growth that we\u2019re seeing in terms of the areas where we\u2019re investing, and for the full year you can think about a number if you adjust for the loan sales and ex-CIB of 2% to 3% full year.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, appreciate that. Just curious - on the non-interest bearing deposits only being down 2% year-on-year, we\u2019ve seen a lot bigger numbers at some peers. Is that just strength of JPMorgan\u2019s franchise or are you doing anything actively to manage that lack of mix shift?","Jennifer Piepszak","As I said, we are seeing balances stabilize in the commercial bank and AUM. We are still seeing some migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, but largely we\u2019re seeing those balances stabilize, and then we do of course have continued growth in the consumer bank. The second quarter is typically seasonally high in the consumer bank, so we have some growth in non-interest bearing there, and even in the consumer bank where we\u2019ve seen growth decelerate, that\u2019s largely as a result of consumer spending, so that feels healthy as well.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Maybe last one. Appreciate the guide on 2019. Because it\u2019s a half, if you looked forward into 2020 with no incremental rate cuts, is it remotely linear? In other words, if we think about if the ongoing rate and curve environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year, are we looking at a billion or is it way too complex to over-simplify like that?","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes, it\u2019s probably more complicated, Glenn. Just given the range of outcomes are as broad as they are, and importantly if we\u2019re looking at cuts that are insurance cuts that sustain the expansion versus cuts that may be in response to a broader economic slowdown, there are other things that we would be talking about, so we\u2019re not going to give further guidance on 2020 until we know more.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, thank you, appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. ","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you, good morning. When you take a look at your merchant services business, you had some really strong growth year-over-year - I think it was up 12%, and then your card volumes excluding the commercial card were also up very strong. Can you share with us what\u2019s driving that strong growth, that double digit rate of growth?","Jamie Dimon","Thanks for noticing.","Jennifer Piepszak","I would say that is firing on all cylinders, so it\u2019s brand, it\u2019s people, it\u2019s product. It does certainly help to have the backdrop of a healthy U.S. consumer as well, and in fact retail sales this morning look strong, so we can expect that to continue.","Gerard Cassidy","Is it more the market as you just referenced - the retail sales, they were strong - is it more that, or are you guys also seeing gains in market share that gives you an added boost?","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes, we have taken share, a little bit of share in card. As you know, we\u2019re number one in sales there. I think importantly, what\u2019s helpful in card is that we don\u2019t even need to take share to grow, just given the secular tailwind that we have in the card business on the electronification of cash, and we\u2019re taking share in merchant acquiring.","Jamie Dimon","And we expect to take more share in the future.","Gerard Cassidy","Speaking of the future, can you guys give us some color on what your first read of Libra is, the Facebook announcement about the payments system that they\u2019re going to initiate?","Jamie Dimon","Yes, so to put it in perspective, Gerry, we\u2019ve been talking about Blockchain for seven years and very little has happened, and you\u2019re going to be talking about Libra three years from now. I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time on it. We don\u2019t mind competition and the request is always going to be the same - the governments are going--you need one level playing field, and governments are going to insist that people who hold money or move money all live according to rules where they have the right controls in place. No one wants to, a, [indiscernible] terrorism or criminal activities, and that\u2019s going to be true for everybody involved in this, and that\u2019d be banks even doing [indiscernible] for a long period of time, and those [indiscernible] I think will just become for everybody at one point, and they should. ","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous. ","John McDonald","Hi. I wanted to ask about the CCAR, and you got a big authorization this year. How did you approach the CCAR plan this year in relation to your long-term CET-1 target, the 11 and 12 that you\u2019ve talked about?","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure. As we think about capital distribution, first we would start by always saying that we prefer to use our capital to invest and grow our businesses, and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend, and only then to return excess capital to our shareholders. We are pleased with the approval and the additional capacity to return that $29.4 billion to shareholders; having said that, we are still targeting the upper end of the 11 to 12% range. We\u2019re always going to want to have a management buffer, because as I had said, our first priority will always be to invest and grow our businesses, and then of course there remains a lot of uncertainty in terms of the regulatory capital framework. ","Then importantly, we wouldn\u2019t actually need to make that decision for a few more quarters, given the way the capital distribution plan is laid out over four quarters, but as of now we are still targeting the upper end of 11 to 12%. ","John McDonald","Okay, thanks Jen. Any updated thoughts on FISO, or could you remind us what your thoughts on initial impact there? Thanks.","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure, so haven\u2019t changed from investor day. Our range continues to be $4 billion to $6 billion, and we\u2019re prepared for the January 1 implementation. ","Jamie Dimon","Just to [indiscernible], so CCAR is one test a year on stress. We do 120 a week, so we are always prepared for stress. CCAR has us losing $20 million or $30 million over nine consecutive quarters. I just want to remind you all that the nine quarters after Lehman, the real stress event, we made $20 million to $30 million, and CCAR assumes you\u2019re going to grow your balance sheet, it assumes you\u2019re going to continue your dividend and stuff like that. We have plenty of capital - I mean, our capital cup runneth over and we\u2019d [indiscernible] that capital. Remember, things like opening branches, for every branch we\u2019ll eventually use $10 million of capital, so four new branches will eventually be $4 million of capital, so restraints on growth also restrains on capital usage and the ability to finance the U.S. economy, so we\u2019re really optimistic about our ability to somehow use our capital, including like the InstaMed acquisition we just did, which I think closes sometime soon, so.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning. Jamie, you mentioned about Blockchain, we\u2019ve been hearing about it for seven years and not much has happened, but I think you at JPM have built a Blockchain solution for at least your correspondent banks. I guess I wanted to understand where you think you\u2019re planning on taking that. Right now, it\u2019s just an AML KYC use case, but is that something that you think you could deliver more functionality over, over time?","Jamie Dimon","We think the Blockchain is real, and the reason it takes so long is people have to agree to the protocols, you have to write a lot of code to get into it. The one you\u2019re referring to, IAN, is think of an information network for banks, so right now banks transfer live information among each other - think of trade finance and correspondent banking and stuff like that, so I think we have 120 banks signed up, we\u2019re going to have 400. So right now, it\u2019s for bank wholesale use to have immediate information, we all have the same information, you can move things; but eventually, you\u2019ll be able to move money quicker with data, so yes, we\u2019re optimistic about that and we\u2019re going to roll that out as soon as we can and constantly test it and make sure it\u2019s secure and all that. ","I remind people when it comes to moving money, JPMorgan Chase moves $6 trillion a day quite securely and quite cheaply. You\u2019ve got to look at the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, but people legitimately said, well, you didn\u2019t have real time payments - that was true, and now we do effectively sell from P to P, and we do effectively [indiscernible] real-time payments in TCH, so we are building the things that the future is going to want - APIs, Blockchain ledgers that have much more data, real-time moving of money that also goes through floor checks, etc. We\u2019re quite optimistic about it. It\u2019s going to take a while to get everyone using it. One day it\u2019ll have to be opened up to a broader customer set, possibly.","Betsy Graseck","One of the things that\u2019s coming out in these senate and house financial services banking committee meetings is this desire for real-time payments, a desire for a cheaper solution for payments, and that\u2019s supposedly what Libra is going to offer; but to your point, it seems like you\u2019re already doing that. The question is, how do we think about the outlook for interchange, and is there--you know, what\u2019s your strategy towards interchange pricing here as we go over this, through this period?","Jamie Dimon","[Indiscernible] there is real-time P2P free save and secure [indiscernible], so when people say do it, that\u2019s already done. That\u2019s not cross-border, so there are people who might want to do that cross-border, and cross border remittances are much, much smaller than actual use of debit card, credit card payment systems here, [indiscernible] built in real-time payments is actually already in use. To me, the issue there is going to be fraud - you know, to make sure with these real-time payments, you also put it through effectively real-time floor checks and stuff like that. ","You know, in the United States, credit cards, debit cards, people love these cards. The beneficiary is the consumer. Always remember, that\u2019s who we\u2019re here to serve, and someone is going to pay eventually for services provided, but people like their credit cards. They use their credit cards far more than they use their debit cards. I don\u2019t remember the last I used my debit card.","Betsy Graseck","Yes, when you get rewards, it\u2019s great. Okay, thanks.","Jamie Dimon","And at JPMorgan, they\u2019ll be getting more free stuff. You get free--you can buy and sell stock for free. We just gave you a very good--it just got rolled out, we only have a few accounts, but local investing, very cheap, very clear. So we\u2019re going to take and give our clients more and better and faster and cheaper all the time, and now we package that with [indiscernible] banking and [indiscernible] card, or discounts on mortgages. That all remains to be seen, but the future is very bright. If we can do more for our customers, that\u2019s a very good thing. ","Jennifer Piepszak","And don\u2019t forget on credit cards, you get chargeback rights and you get the flows.","Jamie Dimon","Right, and you get--you go online, you\u2019re a Chase customer, you get your FICO score for free, you\u2019re going to be able to--we\u2019re going to tell customers [indiscernible] how they can improve their FICO score. You get offers like this Chase [indiscernible] - I mean, we don\u2019t really market it, but it\u2019s really taken off.","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure, so the Chase [indiscernible], we talked about that at investor day. It\u2019s like a really powerful flywheel where we can deliver value to our large merchant clients in terms of being able to bring a very large customer base to them, and then we can deliver that value to our customers at zero cost to us. So as I said in the presentation, we\u2019ve had over 60 million Chase offers activated, so this is really powerful and benefits not just our consumers but our large merchant clients, and at zero cost to us.","Betsy Graseck","So that message of more efficient, less cost maybe needs to get heard on the Hill as well.","Jamie Dimon","Yes, and we talk to the Hill all the time and a lot of people understand that. Of course, they always want you to do a better job for consumers, which we have been.","Betsy Graseck","Yes, I guess the final question here is just on the under-banked. Is there something, or is than an offer than you have for them? Are you considering that, because I\u2019m just thinking about where fintech\u2019s is trying to exploit you, and I know it\u2019s a catchphrase - under-banked, that is being used by [indiscernible], doesn\u2019t necessarily seem like it\u2019s solving anything for them, but maybe you\u2019ve got a better solution that we just don\u2019t focus on.","Jamie Dimon","We have [indiscernible]. I think 25% of our branches are [indiscernible] neighbourhoods. We go to those neighborhoods, we do some philanthropy, we\u2019re doing more and more financial education, which I think is really important. I just mentioned the FICO score, but thing is there might be other things we can do. We do Chase Chat, so it\u2019s get people into the branch to educate them about saving, FICO scores, what you can do to get a mortgage to buy a house and stuff like that. Then we have a product, which really is great, called Secure Banking, and think of it as a card but it\u2019s the full thing. You can overdraft, I think it\u2019s $4.95 a month, but you can use ATMs, you can have direct deposit, you can do online mobile payments and stuff like that, so we think that\u2019s a great product for the under-banked. I think that\u2019s going now 25% or--and we\u2019ve kind of pushed that a little bit more, so we\u2019re always trying [indiscernible]. ","Then we also have special, I call it venture banking, [indiscernible] fund. We\u2019re making loans [indiscernible] non-traditional bank loans that help grow your businesses, so we\u2019re finding a lot of ways to do it and [indiscernible] understand it. I would say we\u2019re at the forefront of that. Fintech, of course is always going to try to eat your lunch, and I think that\u2019s good, that\u2019s called American capitalism, and we have to stay on our toes to compete. But we are. When Jen was at cards, she rolled out last year [indiscernible] Chase My Plan and Chase My Loan, so that people can use their credit balances immediately to do what they want to do and do it well. We rolled out Zelle P2P, that\u2019s good for everybody, so if you have a bank account, you can move money to your friends and relatives without even paying the $10 money changer fees and stuff like that. We\u2019re all-in trying to do a better job for the American consumer, and we think we do a great job for them, and if there are legitimate complaints, we\u2019ll fix it.","Jennifer Piepszak","That\u2019s right, and you mentioned the 25% in LMI [indiscernible] in our expansion markets, that\u2019s 30%.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot, good morning. Just wanted to ask on the balance sheet last year, so you\u2019ve seen a huge jump in the trading related assets, and I know you had the accounting change that you mentioned in the supplement. But could you talk about, is that related to market share gains, is it related to just specific strategies with regard to managing liquidity, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be equally growing on the asset side in the trading liability, so just can you explain the dynamics behind that now that adds to the net interest income story? Thanks. ","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure, so in terms of the balance sheet growth that you saw quarter over quarter, that was primarily related to our balance sheet intensive businesses in the markets businesses, and then we were down on a spot basis quarter over quarter. But you know, we start with deposit growth and so we have had strong deposit growth, so you see that reflected on the balance sheet side as well, and you would have seen securities balances up as well, and some of that is adding duration and some of that is short duration securities that are higher yielding than IOER, and--yes.","Ken Usdin","Okay, so it is part of the liquidity management strategy? Okay. Jen, did you say what the amount of the gains that you had on the loan sales this quarter?","Jamie Dimon","[Indiscernible] if you get a higher return in repo than you get in IOER, you\u2019re going to do that. If you get a higher return in standardized--using standardized capital on securities than you are on wholly owned loans, you\u2019re going to do that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in some of these things.","Jennifer Piepszak","That\u2019s right, the securities growth, I should have mentioned was [indiscernible] due to the home sales and home lending.","Ken Usdin","Right, okay, got it. That makes sense. Did you say what the--can you tell us what the amount of the gains on the loan sales this quarter were, if they were above trend? ","Jennifer Piepszak","We haven\u2019t disclosed the amounts of the gains, and we had some loan sales in the fourth quarter, the first quarter and in the second quarter. The first and second quarter in terms of the notional amount, the first quarter was about $7 billion and the second quarter was about $9 billion, so just a little bit more.","Jamie Dimon","The gains in the second quarter net-net were--they show up in different places, but not much, not material.","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Lastly, just any thoughts on the investment banking pipeline and the continuation of the outlook across the buckets there? Thanks.","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure. In terms of the investment banking pipeline, I\u2019ll just remind you that the third quarter is typically a seasonally lower quarter, and so sequentially you should think about IBCs being down a bit. That said, the pipeline is healthy, although off a record performance last year which is assumption of a reversion to more normal level activity, as well as some overhang from macro uncertainty. In M&A, still feels very healthy and is still a space where companies are looking for synergistic opportunities for growth, especially in North America, perhaps Europe a bit more muted. ECM, we had a very strong second quarter, so that will taper off in the second half a bit, but I would say deals are getting done well in the current environment. Then DCM, DCM will be more subdued, reflecting a slowdown in acquisition financing activity as well as refinancing opportunities, but albeit with a good backdrop for new issuance given the rate environment. ","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I realize rate expectations can change quickly, but how do you think about managing the company in a rate environment that follows the curve that\u2019s out there for three to four cuts? You said earlier you wouldn\u2019t cut back on technology, but are there other areas in expenses? Do you think about managing the balance sheet and liquidity a little bit different? ","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure, so in terms of balance sheet management, we manage the balance sheet in both directions. It\u2019s a negatively convex balance sheet, and so all else being equal, as rates are declining we would naturally just drift shorter, driven both by assets and by liabilities, so you would expect us to add duration, which we did this quarter. But we\u2019re not going to change the way we run the company because of the rate environment, we\u2019re going to continue serving our clients, investing with discipline, and managing the balance sheet across all dimensions, that being capital, liquidity and duration. Then in terms of expenses, again we\u2019re not going to change the way we run the company because of an interest rate environment, and I\u2019ll just say again that the range of outcomes are very broad here and so if we end up with insurance cuts, it\u2019s a temporary headwind, and if we end up with cuts in response to a broader economic slowdown, there will be a lot more to talk about. But as Jamie always says, we\u2019re not going to change the way we run the company because of the macro environment.","That said, in a broader slowdown obviously there are natural levers on volume-related expenses, and we re-decision a large part of our investment portfolio on an annual basis. We will always continue to invest in the things that we think are important, but we would have that opportunity, depending upon the opportunity, to take a look at that.","Jamie Dimon","Remember in a real recession, there are always opportunities for [indiscernible] and vendors fall all over themselves to give you better deals and stuff like that. There are also huge opportunities to spend your money wisely, so the Sapphire card was birthed in \u201909 and you could imagine that--you say okay, we have this great opportunity but we\u2019re not going to take it, and so I think you\u2019ve got to be very careful. The other thing is, marketing money is usually better spent in a downturn, the returns on it usually double.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And you talked about the capital and your thought process there. Obviously the authorization of the buyback is a very big number. Is it your expectation that you\u2019ll use it all, or is that still to be determined based on balance sheet growth, stock price, and the environment? ","Jennifer Piepszak","I would say still to be determined. Our first choice will always be to use our excess capital to invest and grow our business, so still to be determined. As you know, it\u2019s over four quarters and so we have time to think about it, but obviously pleased to have the flexibility.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Is the timing of that even, or is there flexibility there too?","Jamie Dimon","It has been in the past, but we can change that every day.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning. A couple of questions. First on the NII outlook beyond this year, I fully appreciate you\u2019re not giving guidance beyond this year, but you do have the guidance from investor day out there of a sustainable NII of $58 billion to $60 billion, that was set in a very, very different rate environment. If we were to see multiple rate cuts, how do we think about that guidance, and what are some of the moving parts that might get you perhaps to the lower end of that $58 billion to $60 billion? Is it simply dependent upon how the economy responds, deposit pricing? If you can just kind of outline what you think some of those moving parts are.","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure, so the guidance we gave at investor day, steady state 58 to 60, I would say largely still stands, importantly because when we talked about that at investor day, we weren\u2019t assuming any further benefit from rates, so we were assuming that any incremental increases in rates would be offset in re-price, and so the majority of that growth was going to come from balance sheet growth and mix. If you remember the slide, there were a number of arrows on the slide even at that time, which was obviously a different rate environment. We were implying that there were a number of different paths to get there, so that obviously continues to be true, so there may be a different path to get there. It may take a little bit longer, but we still believe in that steady state number because we still believe in the growth of the franchise. ","Saul Martinez","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If I could change gears a little bit, you recently announced that you\u2019re closing Finn, or you closed Finn, and I think the stated logic is you learned that millennials don\u2019t need a separate brand or experience. But can you just elaborate on the logic there and what you learned from that experience, because it does seem to maybe fly in the face of what some other entities or financial institutions are doing with their digital banking strategy.","Jennifer Piepszak","We learned a lot in Finn. You said it, that we learned that importance of the power of the Chase brand certainly means that we don\u2019t need a separate brand. We also learned about a number of features that our customers love, and we were able to reuse those features and port them over to the Chase mobile app. I think we always need to be testing and learning and doing things like this, and not afraid to shut them down when we\u2019ve learned what we needed to learn and can serve our customers through the primary Chase mobile app.","Jamie Dimon","We learned a lot, like how to do digital account openings only digital. When you do it out of a retail bank, you tend to rely on what you already have, so there were a lot of lessons there. We\u2019re always going to be learning from kind of skunkworks and learning from things like that, so we don\u2019t look at those kind of things like failures at all. That is how you learn, and Jeff Bezos will tell you mistakes are good, mistakes are what make you smarter and better, and so I hope we made some really good mistakes that can teach us at all of our businesses at one point. The people doing Finn did a great job, they\u2019re embedded, and by the way, you can open a Chase account now and never go into a branch. You can open an account [indiscernible] it takes minutes to open an account, so we got much better at digital only [indiscernible] separated from the physical branch system.","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes, and the digital account opening is now about 25% of our new account activity.","Jamie Dimon","And we\u2019ll be doing it in small business and merchant processing and all these various things. ","Saul Martinez","Got it, okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar.","Eric Compton","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. This question kind of ties into some of the items already mentioned - longer term tech focus, and also related to Finn. There has been some press recently about reasons for closing down the Finn app, and one of the items that was mentioned was some of the difficulties banks can potentially run into with their legacy platforms, which for the most part are built on COBOL, which has been around since the sixties and depending on who you talk to, these legacy platforms can either be huge problems for banks or not really a big deal. I guess from the outside, at least for me, it can be kind of hard to tell what really is going on there, so my question is as you compete with fintech firms who are building new platforms from scratch, how do you strategically view dealing with your own legacy platforms? Is there a need to kind of re-do these things eventually in order to actually compete with newer tech over time? Do these legacy platforms really hamstring you in any way, or is the hype around those issues really overdone, and if so, why? Thanks.","Jamie Dimon","The hype has been around now for the better part of a decade, right, and we seem to be doing fine. But there is truth--and some of these legacy platforms are also the reason why you have 50 million customers, but it is true that over time, these platforms need to be reformulated and re-factored to be cloud eligible and things like that, and those things are more efficient so your costs will go down, your error rates will go down. The way I\u2019d look at it a little bit is we run 6,000 or 7,000 applications. Over time, those will be marginalized and being re-factored to be cloud eligible [indiscernible] the cloud, very public cloud, and yes, they will be more efficient. But we\u2019ve also had tons of new digital platforms, AIs that are built around these things that do the customer service side [indiscernible] to open accounts in minutes, to get your free credit journey, that we can modify so many things in days and weeks as opposed to years because you\u2019re not monkeying with the whole legacy system, so it\u2019s a little bit of both. But those numbers are embedded in our tech spend - the re-factoring, building data centers, getting better [indiscernible] AI, they\u2019re all in those numbers.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Jamie Dimon","Well, thank you very much. Jen, you did a great job. We\u2019ll talk to you all in a quarter.","Jennifer Piepszak","Thanks everyone. Thanks Jamie. ","Operator","Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call.

Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our web site. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page one, the firm delivered strong underlying performance this quarter with net income of $5.6 billion on strong revenue of over $25 billion, up 5% year-on-year, reflecting growth across most of our businesses, and EPS of $1.36 and the return on tangible common equity of 13% for the quarter. Included in our results with firm-wide legal expense of approximately $1 billion after tax, which relates to a number of matters in large part and estimated amount for FX which was treated as non-deductable tax purposes.","There were also a number of smaller items, most notably a benefit of approximately $400 million of tax discrete items in corporate as well as consumer reserve releases of $200 million pre tax. Excluding these and other non-core items, net income was approximately $5.8 billion reflecting strong core performance. ","The quarter was characterized by continued strengths in our leadership positions as well as market share gains across the consumer businesses. Higher levels of market volatility and client volumes than anticipated in CIB and record performance in asset management. Core loan growth for the quarter was strong up 7% year-on-year while maintaining strong discipline across the board and with encouraging trends in consumer. We\u2019ve also continued to make progress against our capital targets with a CET 1 ratio of 10.1% and firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.5%. All while returning approximately $3 billion as capital to shareholders the quarter, with growth share repurchases of $1.5 billion.","Turning to page two, adjusted expense that excluding legal was $14.7 billion in the third quarter, down approximately 30 million quarter-on-quarter with an adjusted overhead ratio of 59%. We continued to be focused and diligent on managing expenses, although our third quarter adjusted expense may appear elevated in comparison to our full year target of 58 billion, it was substantially driven by higher market performance versus our earlier expectations. If the positive momentum continues in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s likely that our total adjusted expense will be above $58 billion but obviously on higher revenues.","On credit, despite lower reserve releases firm wide credit costs remained very low driven by reduced net charge-offs. We expect total net charge-offs for 2014 to be less than $5 billion which is below our previous guidance. Also included on this page are the returns generated by each of our businesses this quarter. Of note the commercial bank and asset management achieved 18% and 25% ROEs respectively in line with their previous cycle target. CCB was at 19% and if you back out the impact of legal expense in CIB its ROE would have been around 14%.","Moving on to capital on Page 3. The firm reported a fully phased in advanced CET 1 ratio of 10.1% up from 9.8 last quarter reaching our year-end target of 10% plus. Not on the page but for your information the fully phased in standardized ratio was 10.5%. As you know the final U.S. rules on SLR and LTR were published in September, on SLR there were no notable changes and as I just mentioned the firm\u2019s SLR was 5.5% reaching our target level and we\u2019re at 5.7% for the bank this quarter.","The LTR final U.S. rule had some changes versus the NPR, remember we have been disclosing our LTR compliance relative to the Basel rules. The U.S. final rule is in some ways more punitive but we remain compliant with a more modest buffer.","Moving on to business performance starting with CCB on Page 4. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.5 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%. I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the right hand side of the page; it shows that the long-term investments we\u2019ve been making in the business are paying off. Illustrated by the many leadership positions we hold, we\u2019re particularly proud of our customer satisfaction rankings.","We\u2019re seeing continued strong growth in the underlying business drivers, average deposits were up 35 billion year-on-year, an increase of 8%. Our active mobile customer base was up 22% and credit card sales volume of $120 billion was up 12% on strong new account originations. Across CCB we\u2019ve reduced headcount by over 10,000 this year against our year-end target of 8,000 outlined at Investor Day, and we expect a total reduction of 11,000 or so by year-end.","Finally before I move on as you are aware JPMorgan and certain others in the financial services industry experienced cyber-attacks this quarter. We are taking every step to protect our customers and our firm, but these attacks highlight the need for continued and increased cooperation among businesses and the government to systemically reduce and result cyber threats, we are committed to doing our part. To date we have not observed elevated levels of fraud related to this matter.","Turning to Page 5, consumer and business banking. CBB generated net income of $914 million up 20% year-on-year, business continues to improve its operating leverage with an ROE of 33%, up 6 percentage points versus a year ago, with revenue up 5% and expense relatively flat. Underlying business drivers remain strong, average deposits of 476 billion were up 9% year-on-year and client investment assets were up 16% to a record $208 billion. We continued to see strong deposit growth across regions and markets. In fact for the third consecutive year, we led the FDIC survey with the highest deposit growth among the largest 50 U.S. banks. Overall, we grew our deposit share in 46 of our 50 largest markets nationwide and we remain number one in three of the largest deposit markets.","Moving on to revenue, net interest income was up 4% year-on-year, driven by strong deposit growth offset by continued pressure on margins. And non-interest revenue was up 6%, with investment revenue growth driven by Chase private clients and with the addition of over 700,000 households driving stronger fee income. Expense was relatively flat with efficiency improvement in the business being offset by increased cost of control. ","Finally on business banking originations, the momentum that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters continued and we believe we've outperformed the industry with loan originations for the quarter of $1.6 billion up 27% year-on-year, down quarter-on-quarter seasonally. This reflects a combination of industry trends improving driven by business optimism generally continuing to remain strong and improving banking performance, especially in an expansion market as our targeted strategies mature. We do expect the strong growth to continue through the remainder of the year.","Mortgage banking on page 6. Overall mortgage banking net income was $439 million for the quarter, with an ROE of 10%. As expected, the production environment remains challenging, mortgage production and pretax income ex-repurchase was slightly positive for the quarter, a little better than guidance on better than expected expense performance. Originations of approximately $21 billion were up 26% quarter-on-quarter against the market that we estimate to be up approximately 10%. Therefore we believe we've gained share and that share gain has been in high quality jumbo and conventional eligible loans which as you know are the segments we are focusing on. ","As a remainder with purchase mix up, the business has become much more seasonal with volume and profitability peaks in the second and third quarters and lows in the first and fourth. Given this, we still expect the fourth quarter results to be a small negative as previously guided. ","Finally on production we had a $62 million benefit in the quarter driven by refinements to our repurchase reserves. ","On to servicing, net servicing related revenue of 639 million was down 54 million quarter-on-quarter, a gain on the better side of our guidance, due to gains on the sale of Ginnie Mae loans. Looking forward into the fourth quarter, core servicing revenue will continue to decline and we expect less benefit from other revenue sources such as those from Ginnie Mae sales given lower delinquencies and lower loan modification volume.","As a result, we do expect fourth quarter servicing revenue to be $600 million or slightly lower. Servicing expense increased approximately $25 million quarter-on-quarter, due to investments in control and operational improvements. You will note that this represents a delay in achieving our target of $500 million for the fourth quarter. However, we are doing what's necessary to improve our controls and operational processes and we expect servicing expense to continue to decline through 2015 at its lower pace.","MSR risk management was a modest gain of 76 million reflecting regular model updates. On real estate portfolios, we added approximately $6.8 billion of high quality loans to our portfolio this quarter up from $5 billion in the second quarter. ","Loan quality remains very strong. We've recorded net charge-offs of $81 million and reserve releases of $100 million in the non-credit impaired portfolio, reflecting improvements in home prices as well as delinquencies.","Lastly on mortgage, headcount was down approximately 6,000 year-to-date, meeting our target for the year outlined at Investor Day and we are on track to reduce it by an incremental 1,000 or so by year end.","Turning to page seven, Cards, Merchant Services & Auto. Net income of 1.1 billion, down 10% year-on-year but up 4% excluding reserve releases with an ROE of 23%, reflecting very strong spend as well as balanced growth of $3 billion year-over-year continuing the momentum we saw last quarter as growth in our core business is now outpacing the runoff portfolio.","Overall, we saw strong and stable revenue of $4.6 billion, flat year-on-year. Loan growth as well as strong sales volume was offset by spread compression and higher amortization of customer acquisition cost. Expenses up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher (floor) [ph] expense related to Home Depot and higher auto lease depreciation.","In Card, sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 26th consecutive quarter. This industry outperformance is being driven by the value proposition of our core Chase branded and partner products and the investments we are making in customer acquisition, ultimate rewards, marketing and customer service. These investments are driving strong new account originations, up 29%, and the performance of these new accounts, 2013 and 2014 vintages, is exceeding our expectation.","In Merchant Services, volume was up 15% year-on-year driven by continued strong sales performance. But transaction growth was up 6% year-on-year, lagging sales growth, driven by merchant mix and aggregation trends.","In Auto, new vehicle sales continued to grow year-over-year with the third quarter up 8%. We\u2019ve seen the 12th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth despite a very competitive market, and credit losses continued to be stable and low with the Auto pipeline remaining healthy, consistent with the recovery in the auto market.","Moving on to credit, the environment remains benign. We continue to see improvements in card early delinquencies, and the card net charge off rate was 252 basis points, an all-time low. This quarter, we released $100 million of auto and student lending reserves with no releases in card. ","During September, a new step forward in the evolution of payments was announced, Apple Pay. We are excited to be a key player in a solution that offers improved security and the streamline customer experience. At the same time, we are continuing to develop other innovative payment solutions.","Moving on to page eight and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.5 billion on revenue of $8.8 billion and an ROE of 10% or 14% if you adjust the legal expense. In banking, total revenue was $2.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year. IB fees were 1.5 billion, up 2%, with revenue growth in advisory and equity underwriting fees on strong market activity being offset by lower debt underwriting fees.","We maintained our number one ranking in Global IB fees for Dealogic with particular strength in ECM in Europe and IPOs globally and we remain a go-to-bank for large deals and related financing. The IB pipeline is strong with an environment supportive of M&A and a strong equity underwriting market. Treasury services revenue was $1 billion in line with our guidance and lending revenue was down approximately $200 million year-on-year, primarily driven by mark to market losses of over $100 million in this quarter versus modest gains in the prior year on securities received from restructuring.","Let\u2019s spend a moment on markets revenue, the green shoot and the potential upside to our performance that we\u2019ve being seeing in early September did in fact materialize and our reported markets revenues were up 1% year-on-year, despite a strong third quarter last year, a quarter in which we significantly outperformed. ","In fixed income, in currencies in emerging markets, a strong quarter and a particularly strong September with pick-up in both volumes and volatility as currency markets benefited from divergence across global monetary policies, an average quarter for commodities and credit and an improving quarter for rates.","In equities we saw quite strong performance for third quarter in line with last year\u2019s. Cash was very strong in EMEA on the back of a strong primary market and equity derivatives results were lower versus a record last year, offset by an uptick in prime services revenue on higher balances and continued growth.","Of note customers are taking notice of the progress we\u2019ve been making in building out our electronic trading platform and we\u2019re seeing strong growth in electronic trading volumes up 50% year-on-year in Europe and nearly 20% in the U.S.","Moving on to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have completed the sales of our physical commodities business and detailed portfolio, which were major parts of our business simplification agenda and with limited impacts on ROE overtime. However these sales will present revenue headwinds in the fourth quarter and based upon their contributions to last year\u2019s results these will drive an approximately 8% revenue decline year-over-year or approximately $300 million. So outside of the year-over-year decline driven by business exits, we are cautiously optimistic that momentum may carry over. However October so far has been mixed, likely on the back of a changing market sentiment around the prospects of global growth and inflation.","Security services revenue of 1.1 billion was up 8% year-on-year primarily driven by high NII on higher deposits down quarter-on-quarter 5% on seasonality. Assets under custody were $21.2 trillion up 8% year-on-year. Credit adjustments and other are positive $240 million is driven primarily by DVA and FDA as a result of credit spread widening and refinements to certain assumptions.","Moving on to expense, total expense was up 21% year-on-year with a comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter and year-to-date. Non-comp expense was up 21% year-on-year primarily driven by legal expense but down 2% quarter-on-quarter as increased legal expenses were more than offset by lower cost of business simplification and other expenses. Just quickly on CIB loans, the headline 5% decline for loans is driven by lower client overdraft and trades underlying that traditional credit portfolio and other HFI finance were up by over 10%.","Moving on to Page 9 and commercial banking. The quarter saw a net income of $649 million on revenue of 1.7 billion with a strong ROE of 18%. Revenue was down 3% from the prior year and 2% sequentially reflecting yields compression in our lending book as well as business simplification partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances. Expense of $668 million was in line with guidance and relatively flat year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter despite ongoing investments in control. Loan balances increased 1.6 billion in the quarter driven by continued strong performance in our commercial real-estate businesses.","CRE loans increased 13% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter both in excess of the industry and our CRE book have now grown to 14 consecutive quarters. C&I loans were relatively flat from the prior quarter broadly in line with industry trends. Of note deposits increased to $5 billion in the quarter mostly in middle market and corporate client banking, this is reflective of our clients still managing with very high levels of liquidity.","Having said that, utilization rates were up slightly for the quarter and pipelines continued to move incrementally higher across the board. Outside of lending we continued to make good progress in building our core franchise. This quarter growth investment banking revenue was approximately $500 million up 12% from last year and on a year to date basis the commercial bank has generated $1.4 billion of investment banking revenues for the firm, up 22%.","Card and merchant services revenue increased 7% from the prior year and finally since this time last year we\u2019ve added approximately 500 new clients in targeted industries. Overall credit performance remains strong with net charge-offs of only one basis point marking the 7th consecutive quarter with net charge-offs in the single-digit or very low or recoveries.","As we think about the coming quarter we do expect current trends to continue, we would like to remind you of the one-time proceeds of approximately $100 million that we received in the fourth quarter of last year from a lending related workout.","Moving on to Page 10, asset management, an excellent quarter in asset management with record net income of $572 million up 20% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter with a 25% ROE and a 31% pre-tax margin in line with our through-the-cycle targets. ","For the full year, we expect these ratios to be below our through-the-cycle targets. You will see that we changed from reporting our revenue by client segment to reporting revenue by line of business to be consistent with how we manage the business. So we are introducing sub line of business results for revenues in global investment management and global wealth management. ","Overall, revenue was $3 billion was up 9% year-on-year reflecting an increase in management fees driven by long-term net inflows including $16 billion this quarter. This marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term inflows driving AUM of $1.7 trillion up 11% year-on-year. While we continue to see strengths in our multi-asset and fixed income flows, equity flows were flat this quarter. Asset management expense of 2.1 billion was up 4% from a year ago and up modestly 1% versus last quarter. ","In banking, we reported strong performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances up 16% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter with growth coming from both our U.S. and our international markets and a solid pipeline for demand for the remainder of the year. Deposits were also a record up 9% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. ","Lastly as reported, client assets of 2.3 trillion were up 4% year-on-year and down 5% quarter-on-quarter. However as part of business simplification, we closed the sale of the RPS business during this quarter, recognizing a small gain reflected in GIM. Excluding the impact of the RPS sale, client assets would have been up 10% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter. ","Moving on to page 11 on corporate and private equity. Private equity reported $71 million of net income driven by net valuation gains including a small net gain related to the portfolio sale in OEP which we announced in the quarter, predominantly offset by related expenses. Year-to-date the portfolio balance is down by approximately $2.5 billion and with this sale we expect it to be down by about $4 billion by year end. Treasury and CIO reported a small net loss of $30 million with NII slightly positive in the quarter. And other corporate net income at $357 million included in this result were tax related benefits of approximately $400 million as I previously mentioned as well as approximately $500 million pre-tax of legal expense with the remainder of the firm-wide legal expense principally in the IB. At the firm level our tax rate for the quarter was 28% broadly in line with a normalized tax rate of 30% plus or minus. Non-deductible legal expenses in CIB were offset by tax benefits here and other corporate. ","Before moving onto our outlook page, Firm NII was up approximately $320 million quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower interest expense in CIB and core NII was up approximately $110 million. ","Moving onto page 12, you can see on the page our current outlook which I've already addressed throughout the presentation. ","So wrapping up, a strong result for the third quarter despite legal expense of $1 billion after tax. This reflects the strength of each of our franchises and the benefits of the diversified business model. We have made substantial progress against our control and regulatory agenda as well as business simplification albeit with more work to do and we have successfully executed against our 2014 target for capital leverage and liquidity. As I've shown you today, the investments we are making in our businesses are fueling growth and underpinning strong earnings now and in the future and we remain focused on serving our customers and safeguarding their assets and our company. ","With that operator, please open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank ","","Can you just give us a sense of what's left in terms of simplifying the model, maybe split up between the CIB and consumers if that's a good way of approaching it?","Marianne Lake","","Yes, I mean -- I would say we -- I think I can\u2019t remember which quarter it was, but several quarters ago, we put a slide out in the presentation that showed what the business -- it was last year showed what the business simplification agenda looked like. I think if you go back and now look at what we\u2019ve done including what we were able to either complete or sign this quarter OEP, and the RPS business, GSOG, commodities, we\u2019ve certainly broken the back of most of the business simplification agenda.","Having said that, it is an ongoing process and we continue to de-risk clients and industries and continue to simplify our products in mortgage and the like. So I would characterize that the actions that we\u2019ve taken by the end of this year are substantially all of them but at the margin we continue to look client by client, product by product to simplify things.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Okay, now as a follow up somewhat related as we think about having more clarity on the capital rules and specifically the supplementary leverage ratio as well as the LCR. Is there some opportunity for optimization of the balance sheet now that you have more clarity on those rules?","Marianne Lake","So, we\u2019ve talked before about the fact that when you take into consideration the combination of the leverage and liquidity rules together with our own point of view on positioning the company for rising rates so therefore our own point of view of being under invested in a duration perspective that we have we believe a relatively optimized balance sheet. Although it looks like we have a significant amount of cash that is in part non-operating deposits that at some point will either flow out or be adequately paid for by the client return and in other parts is part of our overall liquidity.","I mentioned that subsequent to the U.S. LCR rules being made final, that although we have been reporting previously against Basel our compliance in the 20 plus percent range so a buffer of 20 plus percent. The U.S. rules are more punitive in a number of ways, most notably that they look at peak outflows in 30 days rather than cumulative and also on higher outflow assumptions across certain categories given that we are now compliant with a more modest buffer. So we would say that we are largely optimized.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Okay, and then just lastly, the 300 million of revenue going away in the fourth quarter, what would be the expenses and capital against that?","Marianne Lake","So, the capital is relatively minimal in comparison to the overall firm so while it obviously is positive for us if not a noteworthy number. And the expenses just to note that I said the ROE is limited over time this is a business that was still being built and therefore haven\u2019t yet reached the maturity stage or a stage where it was returning its hurdle. It will take a little bit more time to take the expenses out so there will be a slight lag in removing expenses. So in the fourth quarter it will be more modest, but over time it would be a large chunk of that $300 million.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Stanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","Good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could give us some broader context on the core expenses, is the principle driver of the updated outlook around the 58 billion, is that just comp and can you remind us where you are on the compliance control expenses in terms of leveling off there?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so, look we had a better third quarter than we have been expecting earlier in the quarter. We\u2019ll see how the fourth quarter pans out. So, yes it is the case that if we have a better fourth quarter and therefore a stronger second half of the year that our expectations for comp will be higher. They\u2019ll still be well within our comp to revenue ratio range of 30% to 35% and you saw for the quarter 32% year-to-date the same. So, in large part it\u2019s going to be based on higher revenues in market. This quarter we also had higher revenues in mortgage and also in corporate, so that is the principle driver.","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","And as we look out further to \u201915 and \u201916, could you give us a reminder of where you\u2019re looking to reduce the core expense base and get some savings on one or two year basis?","Marianne Lake","Yes, before I do that you had a second part to your question on the cost of controls, let me just deal with that very quickly. We talked about the fact that we expect our control cost to reach a peak this year, that\u2019s still the case. So, I would say that they are substantially in our run rate by the end of the year. They will over time be able to come down and they\u2019ll still remain elevated relative to historical because of the new business world we\u2019re in. But we\u2019re going to be able to become more efficient, automate things, finish remediations, look back, so over time that will provide leverage.","In terms of looking out to 2015 and \u201916, while we haven\u2019t given specific guidance I\u2019ll just point you to a few things; the first is we do expect to continue to see mortgage servicing expense decline on the back of delinquency and credit trends. We would also expect to see improvements in the production space, there is a reasonable fixed cost base and nevertheless as you saw this quarter we\u2019ve continued to make great progress in residing that expense base. In the non-mortgage space in the consumer bank Gordon has committed to a $1 billion in \u201816 over \u201814 principally but not exclusively driven by automation and efficiencies in branch staffing leverage and also the branch footprint optimization. And then while we didn\u2019t quantify it, Daniel is very much looking at the expense equation for positive leverage that is reasonably significant over the next two years in the CIB.","So I would say across the board and obviously we\u2019re growing in asset management, we\u2019re investing in our businesses notwithstanding.","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","And then on the legal expense, did you give any color in the beginning on what was that for this quarter and in terms of the FX and LIBOR investigations, are those at the stage that where reserves can be built or can you offer anything on that?","Marianne Lake","At the beginning what I did say is that there are a number of matters in our legal expenses for the quarter but in large part it does relate to FX and consequently you can read into that the things are further progressed this quarter than last but obviously we can\u2019t comment any further.","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","And then just in terms of share buybacks and capital levels, I was wondering about your thoughts on the prospects for higher G-SIB buffers in the U.S. and how are you going to balance in the near term your growing your risk based capitals against executing the remaining buyback authorization that you have.","Marianne Lake","Just to talk about, so we did $1.5 billion of buyback this quarter same last quarter, obviously we have another two to go in terms of our approval. We don\u2019t know what the rule is going to be, it\u2019ll come out before the end of the year, we\u2019ll have to see what that says. There will be a transition timeline, it will transition on the same timeline phase in timeline that the rest of the buffer is transitioning on through to the 1 of January 2019. So there is no need for us to overreact and rate the compliance, so we would do much as we have done over the course of the last two years which is balance continuing to make good progress, getting to wherever it is that we need to be which we\u2019re not going to get at this moment against the desire to want to continue to deliver capital to shareholders in the form of increased dividends and repurchases.","Jamie Dimon","And remember you all have forecast where our CET 1 goes up to 10.5 or 10.8 or something like that, when the new CCAR rules come out we\u2019ll probably be able to fine tune where it might look like at the end of 2015.","Marianne Lake","I mean the reality of the situation is sitting at 10.1% wearing good company with the rest of the industry in the context that just given how CCAR operates, its highly likely that there will be overall accretion to capital in the industry over the course of 2015 and we\u2019ll be no exception. So we will continue to accrete capital up towards and potentially above our 10.5. But we\u2019re not going to recalibrate a target until we understand the rules.","One thing on the target, just when you see the rules yourself know that in our 50 to 100 basis points buffer the reason why we had a range was to allow in part to some of uncertainty and things evolving and so we would obviously want to fine tune and put a finer point a point on our buffer. So it\u2019s possible that a buffer may not be as high as 100% too. So we\u2019ll deal will all of that when the rules come out.","Jamie Dimon","And we\u2019ve also been remember very careful, the purpose here to protect and grow the client franchise, meet the regulatory agenda and then we\u2019ll adjust to all these changes as they take place, the big ones we\u2019re go to know by the end of the year.","John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein","And Marianne just on that point, you had some RWA inflation in the first half as you waited some model approvals you are waiting for I believe. Where are you on those model approvals and your expectations for kind of the ratio of risk weighted assets the total assets as we move forward?","Marianne Lake","So you would have seen our other where it came down slightly in the quarter from the second quarter on the back of model improvements and on later on portfolio run-off. So we\u2019re starting to see that bend now. It is the case that as we project forward to the end of 2015, that\u2019s the number that we showed you at Investor Day is still relatively good, it\u2019s probably a little higher than that, we said 1.5 it will be somewhere between 1.5 and 1.55 by the end of next year. We\u2019re not in complete control around the timing of model approvals, we\u2019re obviously doing everything we can to be timely and then the regulators need adequate time to approve them.","So we kind of been a little bit more conservative potentially about the duration it takes to get models approved, but we\u2019re still on that same basic trajectory.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","","So first question on -- deposit growth has been growth and I guess I would love to see higher rates in loan growth. But you are positively positioned for the parallel shift up. I guess my first question is how does that change in more of a flattening environment that we are experiencing right now? Do you capture most of the benefit anyway just getting off zero on the short end? ","Marianne Lake","Yes, I mean -- yes there is a significant benefit. If you look at our disclosures, you can kind of see the short-end versus long-end impact. Basically there is a significant benefit coming up off the short-end that we would expect to capture a significant portion of that in the first 12 months but we are obviously are looking for a more normal curve overall overtime. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI","","Okay. Just -- I know we are not supposed to read too much into it, but in everyone's mid-cycle (DFAST) [ph] results I think everyone was calling for -- or the big banks were calling for higher losses and lower PPNR in general relative to your own self-test from the previous year. Is that conservatism? Because it is a little different relative to the commentary about an improving economy, a little bit better loan growth, good expense control, things like that. I'm just curious what we are supposed to take away from that mid-cycle.","Marianne Lake","","So obviously not to comment on everybody else's results but our results were in terms of the size of the economic downturn they were relatively in line and our results were relatively in line with a few minor sort of enhancements to our process. So we weren't actually looking for materially changed results in our mid-year (DEPAST) [ph]. So obviously we haven't had instructions yet, we are expecting them absolutely eminently possibly as early as this week in terms of guidance from the regulators on how to think about the bank holding company scenario for 2015 CCAR to the degree that there are more and more stressful idiosyncratic losses or stresses on leverage or other things, it could have an impact but we have to wait and see. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay, okay, last one. There are a couple of articles on rewriting of banker's agreements between major dealers to resolve some of the early termination rights issues, which obviously is going towards the Fed's issues on living wills. A, did that actually happen or is that just being talked about? And B, does it resolve the issue in the Fed's -- I know you can't speak for the Fed, but does it resolve the issue or do you still have the client side to deal with over time? ","","Jamie Dimon","So Mark Carney of the FSB and the Bank of England, Chairman said that two major things remain to finish kind of the too big to fail issues. One is the how you deal with derivatives and the second is TLAC and that both of those would be done this year. This is the thing has been done, it's a great example, I think it was 18 firms who got together and came up in a very complex way globally how to deal with this in a way that the regulators and the Fed put out a press release and Mark Carney has been positive about it and it was industry led. So we do think it does solve that issue. So all the buy cycles do it. It will be eventually all the sales side I mean the other way around, all the buy side will eventually want to do it because it\u2019s actually better for the business as a whole, maybe not better for one trading desk but it's better for the business as a whole and it's a little coercive. So that the regulators are basically saying that to do further derivatives you're going to have to adopt these new rules and we think over time a lot of you will do it. ","Marianne Lake  ","And just one thing that the G18 does put a break to the back of the problem and but we are still awaiting actual regulatory guidance. So there is still the strong possibility that the guidance will be broader and we would encourage it to be broader if nothing else for simplicity purposes not necessarily because the G18 alone don't really achieve the result. ","Jamie Dimon","And we were also in a position where even if the buy side doesn't for some reason that we would be able to manage that risk overtime and it would diminish overtime because in the short duration of the derivatives. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI","","Right. And as long as the Fed counts that as \u201cmaterial progress by July of '15\u201d, I am cool with it too. Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","","Hey, a couple of questions. One is on just RWAs in general. There were some articles around potentially shifting some of the repo activity to more of an agent role and principal role. I don't know if that's one of the ways that you could potentially have a light impact maybe on RWAs but on total footings to help with the ratios. Is that something that's being considered? ","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I mean our repo business is as you know substantially client driven and our clients are very interested in ensuring that they are giving us sufficient wallet to allow us to dedicate sufficient balance sheet to their business. So in that sense we continue to see repo as a strategic product for our clients and as cash resource quite frankly. So, it is obviously the case that as we understand any rules but meanwhile leverage rules have been out for a while and we\u2019ve seen leverage reducing the industry overall but we continue to have a strong and healthy repo business.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And would you be supportive of an industry move towards shifting repo to more of a CCP environment or no?","Jamie Dimon","We\u2019re okay with the higher margin that's generated margin rules and if they go to kind of a tri-party CCP they\u2019ll be fine too and it would elevate other issues at that point in time.","Marianne Lake","I mean between the CCP and I think that FSC even put out a framework last night that talked about cross industry including non-financials standardized higher levels of haircut that we are supportive of. So, I think the combination of those two things achieve a great deal.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s great. I asked the question in part because as people are concerned about things like the SIFI buffer increasing and other regulatory capital requirements. I am just trying to tease out what other options you have to your client facing business but yet maybe shrink the footings in a way that deal with these ratios without having to \u201cbreak up the bank\u201d?","Marianne Lake","So, I mean I think that we would do exactly with this what we\u2019ve done with everything else to-date which is overall we\u2019re only going to put our balance sheet to and allow our clients to use it if the overall relationship over time pays us a sufficient return for that. We have the ability to do that somewhat methodically and so we\u2019re being very surgical and very strategic about how we use our balance sheet. But it is a core strategic product for many of our clients and they want to continue to be able to do that.","So, yes, we could. I mean if you look at the numbers, however, you want to cut them. There is within our repo business we do have a match book. We have inventory financing as well. We have clients. We\u2019ve seen our short term wholesale funding so there are things we could do. We just don\u2019t want to overreact.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And then just separately on the payments discussion. In your prepared remarks, Marianne, you highlighted that you are delighted to work with Apple Pay but that you are also working on some other things yourself. Could you speak to what other things you are doing independently? ","Marianne Lake","So, I mean we talked before and you will see more over the coming few months about our own wallet and payments capability. So take Chase Pay and Quick Checkout where we would provide the capability for our customers to be able to have a much more seamless experience also for merchants to have a lower abandonment rates and continuing with the safety and security tokenization and other methods. So we\u2019re continuing to work on our own proprietary wallet and payment capabilities that will be piloted and then subsequently launched over the course of the next coming months.","And then there's obviously the case that we are out to pilot and in production on our end to end capability including Chase Net. So we\u2019re signing up merchants at a faster rate than we expected and again you will hear more about that later. But our ability to now negotiate bilaterally economics with merchants and provide customers with compelling reasons to continue to bring share to us is also something we\u2019re working on.","Jamie Dimon","Our basic philosophy has been that you the customer who want to be able to use your debit cards, your credits in a way that you want and then we want to make it available to you whether its Apple Pay, in-store apps other people\u2019s wallets, these are wallet, our own -- all of which will have benefits et cetera. And as Marianne said, we think that we can also be friendly to merchants with data, with pricing, with simplified contracts. So we\u2019re trying to make this an ecosystem works better for everybody and is far more secure, higher customers on both sides and far more secure.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And I think is it accurate I mean that you mentioned at a recent conference that you were looking to double the spend in cyber security, is that right?","Jamie Dimon","Yes, I was just estimating if I was taking a guess that it will double over the next four or five years.","Marianne Lake","I mean I think it\u2019s fair to say that what we\u2019re seeing in the cyber space not surprisingly is this relentless constant and evolving set of attacks and we need to be constantly evolving and constantly vigilant in response, so it\u2019s entirely reasonable to assume that we\u2019ll continue to increase our investments over the course of the next several years and we\u2019ll -- so it will be larger our we\u2019ll let you know.","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019d like to clarify that quoted in the press not accurately because this is one area where the government and businesses have been collaborating really well. And for a long time is because all these government agencies and I think we need that because the government sees all kind of attacks and they have a fountain of information. And then also industry self-collaborates which is we share information with other banks immediately when we see something happening, so maybe even if something happens to you, you can help one of your brethren avoid a problem like that. And then cyber goes beyond just yourself, its making sure that all your vendors you deal with have proper cyber controls, that all the exchanges have proper cyber controls. So this is -- we\u2019ve identified this as a huge effort, we\u2019ve been very good at it, the most recent breach which we\u2019re not going to make excuses for. We\u2019ll invest any and all things we just do to get it right. Our customers are protected which is critical but we don\u2019t want these things to be happening. But it\u2019s going to be a battle, you\u2019ve already seen a lot of very, very serious far more serious than personal data being taken, where social security numbers, security codes, account numbers et cetera. And we do think that unfortunately there are going to be some wins and losses in this.","This is not going to be one of those things where it\u2019s going to be absolute and we don\u2019t want to be sitting here saying you can absolutely be protected because we think that will put you in a false sense of security.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And those are all great points, I mean you could imagine tokenization moving beyond just payments to any interface with clients at some point?","","Jamie Dimon","Yes, tokenization can be more broadly used and that\u2019s avoided a certain type of fraud but not other type of frauds. So you have to look at each one of these things and say what does it accomplish?","Marianne Lake","And that certainly helps across the payments phase, but there are other areas of vulnerability obviously.","Jamie Dimon","And [indiscernible] security about who came to what systems, when they use private computers with private lines as opposed to public computers from home. There are all these things we are all doing and we\u2019ve had some great people come in audit us and this is one area I suggest to most companies, get someone to come who in as an expert at this. . We have our own attacker system where we have our own people trying to get through, so we\u2019re always trying to look where we might have a weak spot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous","","I just wanted to follow-up first of all on the question that Glenn asked about the change in the derivatives contracts. From your perspective doesn't this fundamentally render the contract less attractive for users because of the loss of the automatic bankruptcy preference? And if so, would you expect that this is one more potential pressure on the derivatives revenues that you've talked about in the past potentially depressing your revenues by as much as $1 billion?","Jamie Dimon"," ","I don\u2019t think it makes it less attractive, for the one reason if you look at one contract that someone may have in one fund or something like that, it may make it slightly less attractive. But if you looked at the improved safety of the system I think it makes it more attractive. So people believe that doing this makes the whole system safer, every institution say while on the one contract side I will prefer to have the optimality but for the total I\u2019d like the fact the system is protected and we have time to work all those out.","If the resolution works that is really, really good for everybody. I mean everybody would have preferred that there was a resolution process in place for Lehman. The pain and suffering would have been far less across derivatives even though they didn\u2019t have the same -- they had more protection derivatives at the time.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","And while we are on that topic then, another thing that happened during the quarter obviously was the Fed and FDIC rejecting the living wills. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for what changes that might have provoked from your point of view in terms of accelerating some of the simplifications that you were talking about earlier? ","Marianne Lake","So I think just an important point of clarification for what its worth is the that the FDIC found the industry\u2019s 2013 plans not credible and the Fed did not. So it wasn\u2019t a joint agency conclusion at that point. And so we haven\u2019t had to comment on the 2014 plan yet. Having said that we talking to JPMorgan, we made substantial progress even between the '13 and '14 submissions, we\u2019re in dialogs with our regulators to understand even more detail of what they found as being the limitations or the vulnerabilities in our credibility of the plans, we\u2019re committed to remediation in by 2015. It has had little bearing on our business simplification agenda because it was already a very broad and appropriate agenda but we continue to work on all number of things around the place, critical operations, legal entities, simplification and we\u2019ll continue to do so.","Jamie Dimon"," ","Remember the FSB led by Mark Carney has made it -- they have said publically that the two big remaining pieces are TLAC, which should be done this year, and the derivatives stay, that would be common harmonization around the globe and those two pieces are going to be in place and make resolution much more achievable.","Marianne Lake","","And we should add that obviously there is a protocol was specifically pointed out in that feedback and the industry voluntarily resolves that issue I think very well.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous","Yes, fair enough. I mean I think a lot of times the press reports forget to pull together all the pieces like that. ","I hate to beat the regulatory horse too hard here, but one of the things that we were hearing towards the end of the quarter was that our clients were telling us that they were seeing a significant fall off in liquidity in some aspects of the credit markets in particular. And I was wondering, is there any link between that and some of the new filings that you\u2019ve had to start doing on a daily basis for -- not just you, but obviously all the dealers on liquidity? And I think some of the Volcker data gathering has started as well. And I was wondering if there was any linkage there? ","Marianne Lake","","No. So I mean my point of view on this is that while we have started doing a filing more recently we've been well aware of the requirements for a reasonably long if not very long period of time and have reoriented our business to be compliant in substance with the requirement. So the fact that we are producing metrics at this point isn't having meaningful impact on our business. It is the case that we know over the course of the next year between now and the compliance date next July, we do expect to as an industry receive feedback on that data and we\u2019ll have to see how that progresses but it's our point of view that our business is compliant.","Jamie Dimon","Industry wide as people push LCR and capital and some of these rules down to the trading desk that you did see a reduction in inventories et cetera, but our view is that market making is a critical role in society and it has to take place, we have 16,000 clients and so we really do focus on serving those clients and we've electrified more of it, some of them will go to clearing houses, some of it would be -- but we want to be there for the clients and we will see how the industry sorts out. Some people in the industry are making much more drastic decisions than others. And our decision has been to be there, to make markets. And just try to adjust the new rules which may make it a little bit more costly to trade.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous","","But what I think I hear you saying is that the recent imposition of some of these reporting requirements did not in itself have those liquidity impact?","Jamie Dimon","I think it wasn't the report reporting requirements, I think it was pushing down at LCR, the cost of capital, the cost of debt and the traders reduced their balance sheets a little bit and they were a little more cautious how to use balance sheet. And that's industry wide. And then some people said we simply can\u2019t stay in these areas. I've seen people exit certain trading areas. ","Marianne Lake","","Yes, I mean repo is a good example of that where the level of not concerned but the level of dialogue with clients around our willingness to continue to commit our balance sheet to that business has increased because others are less willing. And so we are seeing some of that visual.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous","","Got it. And then the last one for me, Marianne, you gave some clarification around loan growth in the CIB. But I am not sure I quite understood it. Basically you said the minus 5% headline number was affected by a couple of it sounded like one time-ish kind of things and what the underlying was. But as I said, I'm not sure I really caught your drift. ","Marianne Lake","","Okay. So let me give you the down piece of it. One of them is not timing, it's just the continuation of a trend where trade finance loans are down substantially year-over-year. And so when you look at the overall loan balance is being impacted by trade markedly. And then on the client overdraft side, that is something that is a little bit lumpier obviously. So those two things are driving it down. But the point to the comment was a little bit not trivialized reported loan growth which was still positive but with those masking underlying performance in our credit portfolio in HFI loans. So our more traditional credit lending continues to grow and grow at 10% plus pace.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Can you share with us -- obviously the Federal Reserve is asking for more capital for all the larger global SIFI type banks. What's the minimum cushion would you guys be comfortable running against? You mentioned your 50 to 100 basis points might be a little less. How low would you go in your cushion for meeting those new capital guidelines when they come out down the road? ","Marianne Lake","","So I think -- look a reasonable point of view on that would be at the lower end of that range, at the 50 basis point. So remember when we -- obviously we\u2019ll refine it and would update you but when we have thoughts about having a buffer, it\u2019s been, it is there in order to protect us from range of issues including capital volatility driven by AOCI we regularly and routinely stress our portfolio to understand how much stress we could see in AOCI in a short period of time and that\u2019s going to be one of the principle drivers. So I would say that\u2019s the reasonable benchmark for the level that we would go to. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to have that buffer in totality. As I said, buffers phase in between now and January of 2019. So whatever we decided it, however we communicate that to you, that as well as all of the other buffers capital conservation buffer and G-SIB will phase in.","Jamie Dimon","And CCAR may still be a limiting factor, so\u2026","Marianne Lake","As Jamie said the reality is that the why CCAR is operating while there has been good progress in the communication and dialog with the regulator, the reality remains that it is still not clear either quantitatively or qualitatively exactly how everything is working and therefore its unlikely to be the case that in this cycle that you\u2019re going to see 100% or greater than 100% distribution, that\u2019s my view.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Yes. No, regarding the return on equity, at Investor Day you guys gave us the through the cycle target of 15% to 16%. Clearly I would assume that in this year's Investor Day when it comes up, if these capital levels are even higher now than what you originally thought when you gave that guidance, it probably will be a bit lower. What lines of business do you think will see the lower ROE targets, if you decide that you need to lower it through the cycle from the 15% to 16% that you gave us last year? ","Marianne Lake","So I mean just before we sort of get onto the business by business lens on it, I mean the reality mathematically is obviously true that if we have higher capital we would prima facie defacto have lower returns. But the reality hasn\u2019t been that way over time. So, you know acutely that we\u2019ve added significant capital over the last, however, many years. And have been able to over time continue to reorient the business and optimize against it to deliver strong returns. So could there be a decline in returns, we will obviously have to see what the rules look like.","Clearly, at the moment, the most clear and present danger relates to higher G-SIB surcharges on short term wholesale funding. So in the first order impact of it would obviously have an impact on directly those businesses and products in the CIB but obviously if the company is holding more capital we\u2019ll look more broadly. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that you\u2019re going to see a pro-rata decline in our returns and obviously we are continuing to focus on our expenses and making sure that the overall business is as efficient as possible.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Is it fair to say that today\u2019s ROE in today\u2019s quarter of about 10%, which obviously is below your through the cycle number. Is it primarily an interest rate issue that\u2019s holding it back or is there some other issue, the high elevated expenses that you\u2019re running due to all the new regulations and stuff?","Marianne Lake","So I mean 10s in ROE, 13% ROTCE remember the target is an ROTCE target. It\u2019s obviously right now in 2014 we\u2019re in a bit of a cyclical low in a number of ways, and elevated expenses. So, it\u2019s cyclical lows in mortgage at least for the first half of the year cyclical lows and some secular headwinds in the market space. Yes, we are reaching a peak in terms of control expenses so that is in part contributing reserve releases are low a little bit, the credit remains benign but as a relative matter they\u2019re lower. But we are staring efficiencies in the face across our businesses over the course of the next two years.","So, control costs will decline, CCP will deliver improvements in expense, CIB will also. Rates will be a meaningful piece. Clearly, you\u2019ve seen our sensitivity to rising rates is relatively significant, but it\u2019s not the only piece. When the economy generally recovers when loan growth recovers and volatility recovers, all those things, good things happen.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Shifting gears, if we look at leverage lending the Federal Reserve has come out recently concerned about some of the underwriting that's going on there. And I think they even pointed out that leverage lending now will be used in the CCAR possibly from a qualitative standpoint. Can you guys give us any color on what your understanding is of what is going on with leverage lending today? And will it be included in CCAR?","Marianne Lake","So just to talk about what will included in CCAR, the truth is we don\u2019t know. So, what you have seen we have also read but that doesn\u2019t constitute any kind of guidance, we haven\u2019t received guidance yet. So we\u2019re going to have to wait to see that. It wouldn\u2019t be entirely surprising if there were some sort of leverage stress in that quantitatively, I can\u2019t see to qualitatively. And then yes there have been more stringent guidance on leverage lending from the regulators over the course of the last year. And we\u2019ve taken a fairly strict line on applying that. So it has in part been one of the reasons why we believe we have seen lower loan growth in some of our business than we would otherwise have seen.","Jamie Dimon"," ","It\u2019s going to get a little stricter in the refi part of the leverage loans, and obviously whatever the terms are we will meet the terms and some of that business will go to non-banks, some banks who are not regulated by the OCC and the Fed.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","You guys gave us some very good numbers on the mobile approximately usage by your customers. What\u2019s the penetration rate of your customer base that uses that mobile app?","Marianne Lake","I mean it\u2019s still relative to 20 something million customers in household in the 23 something like that million households in the retail sales space is still relatively low. And from recollection we\u2019ll check the numbers for you I think is in that 2 million to 3 million range, but nevertheless\u2026","Jamie Dimon"," ","Mobile is much higher than that.","Marianne Lake","Mobile is higher, okay. We\u2019ll get back to you.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And then finally you guys talked about Apple Pay\u2026","Marianne Lake","It\u2019s 18 million.","Jamie Dimon"," ","Its 18, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s individuals or households, it\u2019s a huge amount.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","You guys mentioned the Apple Pay and the opportunities there. What are some of the business -- where can you see the growth but at the same time where can Apple Pay cannibalize some of your businesses or are there any that would be cannibalized? ","Jamie Dimon"," ","Look again our view is to -- if you\u2019re a client and you want to use your Apple Phone to pay with NFC at a merchant, that\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t want to say you can\u2019t use your JPMorgan Chase credit card or debit card. And like we said we\u2019re going to be in other people\u2019s wallets too and we\u2019re going to have our own which we think will have some competitive advantage. So will it cannibalize? Sure, but we\u2019re not against cannibalizing our own business or disrupting ourselves if we\u2019re building a better business and are gaining share. Certainly our goal is to gain share. We do believe a little bit and you know when Jeff Bezos says your margin is my opportunity, we want to be the people that come with new ideas and stuff that are getting more of our customers using our stuff and happier. And if reduces certain margins somewhere, so be it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","","A follow-up on the loan question from before. You mentioned a little bit more caution with leverage loans. In the past you said you didn't want to compete too much in the commercial space if it's getting too competitive. There's been some current concerns about auto lending with regulators. So my question is, slide 1 highlights that your core loans are up 1% quarter over quarter and the same slide in the second quarter said that core loans were up 4% quarter over quarter. So my question is, are you simply getting more cautious in the loans that you provide or is there a little bit less demand in the market? Really trying to get to is loan growth decelerating? ","Marianne Lake","I mean if you look at year-over-year trends, they continue to be in there, I mean I think the first quarter year-over-year was 4%, 8% in the second quarter and 7% in the third quarter. I think we\u2019re not expecting those year-over-year trends to be decelerate, obviously quarter-over-quarter things can be impacted just by the timing of closing loans. So fundamentally I would say no we aren\u2019t seeing significant deceleration quarter-over-quarter within continued relative momentum solid across the board with obviously more challenges in the C&I space.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Separately your expense guidance is now for over $58 billion, you said some of that\u2019s due to comp. Is any of that increase in guidance due not to comp?","Marianne Lake","Relative through the $58 plus or minus that we previously said, no it\u2019s principally in high revenues or higher market performance.","Jamie Dimon"," ","And we always said that might be the case. So we\u2019re meeting our overhead numbers and the comp itself is bouncing around a little bit. Remember in the old days we used to break out IB comp in total for that reason.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Separately which capital ratio is your binding constraint? And using that ratio, what should we use in our model three years out? And I know that's a tough question with all the moving parts, but what's your best guess? ","Marianne Lake","So just in terms of what is our binding constraint at the moment, it is CET 1, so Basel III advanced capital and risk based capital at the margin, so it\u2019s not to say that the other ratios leverage liquidity and the like aren't comfortably around it and even stress capital. But that is currently our binding constraints. It\u2019s very hard for us to give you a point of view of where you should do this in your model three years out when we\u2019re staring potentially new rules in the face in the next two months. As I said earlier we are expecting over the course of the next 12 months that we\u2019ll continue to accrete capital at to or above our 10.5% which is basically in line with what you guys all have in your models. Beyond that, it\u2019s our expectation that hopefully anyway putting new rules aside that by the time we are in our fourth or fifth cycle of CCAR we have made substantial industry-wide progress in the sort of non-quantitative aspects of CCAR where we have more credible resolution and the like that we will be able to be more aggressive in our ability to seek capital distribution capability. So outside of any changes in rules we would hope at the end of 2015 into 2016 CCAR to be able to have payout ratios are much higher, but we will have to see.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","","Okay. And then last question on the supplement page six, this is a smaller item but it just kind of stands out. Your rate on trading liabilities declined from 48 basis points down to 12 basis points in just three months. Is there anything unusual there?","Marianne Lake","","Yes, there is. So about half of that I would call -- approximately half of that I would call relatively normal but included in that result there is actually a one-time item associated with accounting for a previous interest accrual that we released in the quarter which is one time you should expect that interest expense to go back up next quarter is something more normal.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","","And how much, what was the dollar amount of that impact?","Marianne Lake","","A little less than $100 million. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Just wanted to follow up with two quick questions. The first is, Marianne, if we put together everything that you have said on expenses so far in this call, is it fair to assume that without rates the adjusted efficiency ratio of 59% can continue to improve in 2015 and 2016? ","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I think \u2013 yes it is, it is our belief that we should be able to manage the ratio to be able to improving overtime ultimately getting down to something much more in the mid-50s, so that is dependent on revenue growth associated with rates but not limited to rates. So in the absence of rates, but by the way just to point out, that is still our case that based upon continued improvement in the domestic economy the rates will start to rise in the middle of next year. But having said that even without rates we would hope to be able to continue to maintain the discipline to have that ratio be broadly flat to down. ","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Great. And the second follow-up question is, given your expectations for rates to rise in the middle of next year are you still -- and the progress that you -- continued progress you make on deposit share are you still expecting $100 billion in deposit outflows in that case? ","Marianne Lake","","So since we talked about the $100 billion estimated deposit outflows associated with liquidity draining out in the system, remember that was predicated on believing that it was possible that the Fed would use the reverse repo program in much more size and is likely to be the case today for two reasons. One is that obviously they've made changes to the term deposit that allows them to now be LCR eligible which is helpful in terms of providing another tool in that toolkit and the second is that in September as you know the RRP was capped in total at $300 billion. That cap may or may not be permanent I am sure it will be recalibrated over time but it looks like it will be unlikely to reach the $1 billion that would have driven the $100 billion, so at $1 trillion that would have driven a 100 billion. So you can make your decision about whether its $300 million or $500 million in the foremost of time and scale our operating deposit outflows back relative to that knowing of course that it's already in operation at $300 billion right now. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","","So, appreciate that the repo book is substantially client driven. Was maybe hoping that you guys could give us some sense for how much of your repo book is firm financing versus facilitation? ","Marianne Lake","","Brennan, we haven't disclosed that. A large chunk of it is client driven, that's what we will say. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","Okay. Worth a shot.","Marianne Lake","","The larger chunk of it, the larger chunk of it.","Jamie Dimon","We've also lengthened the firm financing part of it.","Marianne Lake","","Yes.","Jamie Dimon","To be more compliant with LCR et cetera.","Marianne Lake","","Right.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","Okay, that is fair. And I just wanted to try to square something here and maybe I am reading just a little too much into it. You had said that October on the capital markets side has been a bit mixed. But you have also at the same time brought up your expense guidance and it seems like its driven by expected or potentially a component of comp and capital markets. So are those two at odds? Are you just more optimistic that maybe what we're seeing here in October is not necessarily some sort of dramatic shift but a temporary bout in bad volatility? Or how can we square those two? ","Marianne Lake","So, I would square in to it, the first is we already did have a better performance in the third quarter than would have been anticipated in our previous guidance given that that guidance was given during the sort of harder times of the second quarter. So that\u2019s already in our run rate so to speak in terms of the comp that would accrue to that. And then if you sort of go back and in the form of the time look at the trends because I did say if the performance continues into the fourth quarter. So it will depend. We\u2019ve always said and evidently maybe we should strip out comp from our adjusted expenses. But we\u2019ve always said that the adjusted expense absolute number in any period is obviously going to be calibrated to the performance of the market related businesses. And clearly, you would wave in good revenues every day at 32% comp to revenue ratio. So that\u2019s really all we were saying, nothing more subtle than that.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","And then appreciate that there is not much color potentially to be added on this charge tied to FX. But just is it possible to let us know if it\u2019s tied to a particular geography?","Marianne Lake","No, it\u2019s not possible to talk about anything more detail I am afraid. Suffice to say that we are working with a number of regulators across a number of jurisdictions.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","All right, that is fair. And then last one for me. So in looking at the NIM simulation that you guys have provided, and then taking a look at that in light of the interest rate shock disclosures you've got in your Q's, it looks like a 200 basis point rate shock adds about half of what you are looking for in a normalized rate environment. So I guess does that mean that subsequent years sort of the benefit of rolling the portfolio into higher rates is going to exceed the higher deposit cost by about $4 billion to $5 billion? And is there a particular time period that we should think about that or is it going to be too heavily influenced by competitive dynamics? ","Marianne Lake","So you are right that when you roll forward during the first 12 months you do get the benefit of being able to continue to reinvest deposits as they mature up the curve in terms of their underlying investments. So that is the compounding effect of what you\u2019re seeing in our earnings and risk shock. But what we showed I think and I am going to cease to recall it but maybe it was in the Barclays conference in 2013 is that you would expect once rates start to rise if they rise in a somewhat expected fashion so obviously it depends on what rate cost you want to put on that that you could expect the accumulative NII to be in our impact in three to four years.","Jamie Dimon","And remember the benefit is more for the first 100 a little bit less to the second 100, a little bit less to the third 100, a little bit less to 400 because there is increasing re-pricing of deposits at that level. And we don\u2019t know exactly what the yield curve will be four years out. And also we do embed in that our own estimates of competition and re-pricing.","Marianne Lake","That\u2019s a very good point actually Brennan. All scenario does contemplate not only a more normal loan to deposit ratio, more normal interest bearing versus non-interest bearing deposit and also a higher feature on retail deposits just given the LCR competitive dynamics, the technology advancements and the like. So, to the best of our ability we\u2019ve tried to bake that in and that\u2019s included in our number.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Just a tactical follow-up just on the balance sheet. With the non-interest-bearing deposits basically being the fastest growing category of the balance sheet and the resulting asset, the deposit with banks also being the fastest-growing asset on the balance sheet. Just within that context of what you just walked through with Brennan, I am just wondering what changes structurally with the way you think about reinvesting in the securities portfolio with rates as low as they are now. Loan growth is okay, but to your point you are being somewhat selective on -- and want to be careful with pricing and credit. So, just from a -- more so taking the next year or so out, how are your thoughts changing at all with respect to what you do with these deposits given that they might actually not flow out as much given that change to the RRP function? ","Marianne Lake","So the deposits there were -- so in part not totality, in part the deposits that were likely to outflow through the RRP were non-operating deposits. And non-operating deposits we do not count for significant liquidity value in the firm we fundamentally has an on deposit at central banks at the Fed and so if they stay so we\u2019ll come back to whether we would be willing to let them stay, but if they stay they will continue to basically be treated in that way and they are not included in terms of our assumption around asset sensitivity and forward looking NII. ","Obviously over time we are in the same ways we talked about repo, we are looking at non-operating deposits for our client in the context of their overall relationship and so that is another valuable use of our balance sheet with leverage capital alike against it and in the fullness of time we\u2019ll expect the overall relationship to pay for that, but we are going to wait and see some of those dynamics play out. ","So other than that, I will just go back to the earlier comment I made that we do have a high level of HQLA and not in cap nor in securities but it is in order to make sure that we have adequate liquidity both under our own stresses most importantly but also under LCR and NSFR and we feel good and add modest buffers relative to them.","Jamie Dimon","In the typical quarter end, we have a lot of large clients leave a lot of deposits here which obviously are not necessarily good for us in terms of LCR or capital etcetera and we will be looking at how we manage those client relations overtime too. The other thing I remember is securities portfolio is as rates go up the duration of that extends on its own.","Marianne Lake","","Correct.","Jamie Dimon","And so we will be managing that and yes we might invest more than 1 point but we are in a very conservative position right now.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Yes, okay. Got it. And then secondly, just two quick ones on mortgage. Default servicing costs have pretty much stabilized the last couple of quarters at a good level that you had talked about getting down to $500 million total by the fourth. And I am just wondering how much more room is there given that improvement in underlying trends that you're continuing to see for that to be a benefit to that cost side of the equation going forward?","Marianne Lake","","So we are continuing to see credit trends improve, delinquencies come down, modification pipelines, all the metrics are coming down, obviously they are coming down from a much smaller place this year than they were last and the year before. So the pace of improvement or the relative pace is slower but we are expecting that to continue down through 500s and into the 400s in 2015. And then just more longer term, you know that we are focused on ensuring that through the next cycle we have a smaller delinquency portfolio and so a more normal level would be substantially less than this. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Okay. And I noticed that your [multiple speakers]. ","Marianne Lake","","Sorry, that's a longer term view.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company","Yes. And I noticed also that underneath the origination improvement this quarter, there was a decent jump in correspondent. I am just not -- I just wanted to ask if you are doing anything differently in terms of market share opportunities on the mortgage side now that things have shaken out a little bit or any change in your underlying philosophy on where you are looking at originations? ","Marianne Lake","","Yes, so I mean we talked last quarter about the fact that we had loss share a combination of things primarily our strategy around the government mortgage space but also a little bit of share in what I would call in our target segment. So we've made that back. So in some part it's just continuing to leverage our balance sheet properly due very granular marginal pricing to really focus on changing and improving our customer operating processes. So across the board, we just continue to get very granular and try and be as competitive as we can. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura.","Steve Chubak - Nomura","Marianne, I appreciated the color you had given on the RWA guidance. I suppose one thing that we have been hearing from a lot of clients, or at least concern from clients, is this notion of regulatory gold plating, essentially the US regulators adopting tougher standards than those that are being enforced in other areas around the globe. And I just wanted to get a sense as to how that's informing your thinking about RWA mitigation plans. You reaffirmed the guidance at Investor Day, but what should we expect in the event that a tougher capital as well as TLAC requirement is in fact enforced against US G-SIBs? ","Marianne Lake","So just to be very clear, maybe it's actually slightly higher than Investor Day in terms of our guidance. So look obviously any guidance that we give you and no good deed goes unpunished but any guidance we give is always predicated on based upon what we know today and so if something changes that would change that point of view will obviously have to recalibrate it. But just prima fascia having the requirement to have extra long-term debt or lots of building capital and\/or capital wouldn't necessarily prima facie change the overall RWA we have. You have to be careful to ensure that by having higher levels of capital does not incentive to want to stretch in the credit box. So we have very tight credit discipline. So I wouldn\u2019t see that being a material change the outlook but obviously if there is a change in rules that directly affect RWA, that would do.","Steve Chubak - Nomura","","And then just switching gears to the investment banking outlook that you had given. I appreciated the color which sounded quite constructive on the backlogs for M&A and ECM. And I guess not just you but the industry in general hasn't given much commentary on the outlook for debt capital markets activity. It has been challenged this year. I think that was something which many of us had expected just given the strength that we had experienced over the last couple of years. But I didn't know if you can just provide some updated thoughts on that revenue stream in particular.","Marianne Lake","","I mean look it is the case that a lot of refinance has already happened. So the debt maturity wall is smaller although rates are lower than we may have expected at this point in time. So I would -- so therefore yes it is reasonable to assume that there is going to be some continued headwind but having said that, I think there is going to be windows of opportunity. So we\u2019re going to -- M&A and ECM are more constructive and likely to be more buoyant, but I think that capital market still has windows of opportunity."," ","Operator","","There are no further questions at this time.","Jamie Dimon","Folks, thank you very much for joining us and we will talk to you soon.","Marianne Lake","","Thank you."],"12222":["JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Q4 2013 Earnings Call  January 14, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jamie Dimon - Chairman and CEO","Marianne Lake - CFO","Analysts","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Derek De Vries - UBS ","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca ","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward looking statements at the back of the presentation","","So if we start on page one, the firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.30 a share, with a return on tangible common equity of 14%, on revenues of $24 billion, down 1% year on year, and up 1% quarter on quarter. ","As you see, we had several significant items in the quarter, which I will review as we go through the presentation in more detail, but they include a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $0.5 billion gain on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, both in the corporate segment; as well as $0.8 billion pretax, or a $1.1 billion after-tax impact of legal expense in the quarter, partially booked in mortgage, with the remainder booked in corporate, principally the Madoff settlement recently announced; a $1.3 billion benefit from reduced loan loss reserves in consumer businesses.","And then in addition, CIB\u2019s results for the quarter include a $2 billion loss for [DVA] and FVA, or funding valuation adjustment, which I will also come back to in more detail.","The total impact of these items is a negative $0.10 of EPS. So not to diminish their importance, but to illustrate the strength of the core performance of the underlying businesses, if you do adjust our results for these items we would have earned, $5.7 billion less income, $1.40 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%.","So talking about the full year, skipping over page two and straight to page three, reported net income of nearly $18 billion, or $4.35 a share, on revenue of approximately $100 billion, and a return on tangible common equity reported of 11%. Again, if you adjusted for all reported significant items in the year, we would have earned net income of over $23 billion, $5.70 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%. Again, strong underlying performance for the full year.","Of note, let me talk for a minute about adjusted expenses. You can see on the page that our adjusted expenses, excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters, are a flat $60 billion. This is in line, albeit at the high end, of our guidance of $59.5 billion to $60 billion for the year. But, included in this number is a total of close to $1 billion of other noncorporate legal expense, which, if we had adjusted, would have left a more core number at just over $59 billion, despite the incremental investment in controls of $1 billion that we made in the year.","So briefly recapping on 2013, clearly a year marked by regulatory developments and significant legal settlements. However, more importantly, also a year in which our businesses, together and individually, performed strongly. We succeeded in further progressing our customer satisfaction agenda and gaining market share across businesses.","2013 saw very strong credit performance across businesses, including significant improvements in mortgage. And finally, we ended the year with strong capital liquidity and margins.","So let\u2019s talk about capital on page four. I\u2019m not going to talk much about Basel I except to say that you can see we progressed our ratio in the quarter to 10.7% Basel I tier one common. But importantly, if you look at the middle section, you see that our Basel III tier one common ratio is 9.5%, meeting our year-end target.","Just a few words on the components underlying this ratio. Three things: first, we generated approximately $5 billion of net capital in the quarter. Second, we also saw significant RWA benefit of model and parameter updates, including HPI and lower spreads, as well as portfolio runoff. And third, these positives together, worth over 60 basis points of improvement, were reduced by about 50 basis points due to higher levels of operational risk capital.","The significant increase in operational risk capital this quarter is largely driven by the inclusion of the large legal expense from the prior quarter. We will spend some more time on capital at investor day, but despite headwinds, we still anticipate reaching 10% plus or minus Basel tier one three common by the end of this year.","A quick update on leverage. Both the firmwide and the bank supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules increased to 4.7%. I\u2019ll come back on the next page to talk about the final Basel SNL framework that was issued this weekend.","During the quarter, the holding company converted [certain] into company debt at the bank into capital, improving the bank\u2019s relative ratio. We remain compliant with LCR at the firm level this quarter, including the impact of the proposed new rules, and we continue to have about 19% of available resources relative to risk-weighted assets at the end of the year.","Before we move on, as you know, the Volcker Rule was finalized in the quarter, and having had the opportunity to consider the rule, some thoughts. The certainty provided by having a final rule, and the implementation date of July 15, were welcome. ","It is a tough rule, and the regulators have laid out stringent standards for compliance policies, procedures, controls, and testing, which will bring operational challenges to implement. However, we believe that the firm will be materially compliant across our businesses with the rule. We have work to do to get there, but we don\u2019t expect any material impact to our results. ","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the impact of the final SLR framework from this weekend, on [unintelligible]. As you saw, the Basel committee released the framework this weekend, which has gone a long way towards closing the gap relative to the U.S. NPR. And the changes they made are responsive to industry feedback and seem sensitive to potential market impacts.","Our initial analysis estimates that the impact will worsen both the holding company and bank ratios by only approximately 10 basis points relative to U.S. proposed rules, so that would be 4.6% for each of the holding company and the bank.","This impact is primarily driven by a positive related to improved assumptions on unfunded commitments being slightly more than offset by the inclusion of written credit protection provisions, previously not in the U.S. rules. ","However, between the likely implementation in the future of NIM for derivatives\u2019 potential future exposure and the ability over time for us to improve [unintelligible] for cash collateral, there should be significant improvement opportunity ratio in terms of basis points.","Overall, our leverage action plans don\u2019t change materially. We\u2019ll be thoughtful and measured about implementation in 2014 and beyond, and our perspective on specific products and businesses is not just driven by capital implications, but also by the importance to the broader franchise and client relationships.","We do expect to reach 5% plus or minus at the holding company by the end of this year and to be compliant at the bank shortly thereafter. The next step is for the U.S. regulators to determine when and if they\u2019ll adopt this new denominator, although we feel it\u2019s reasonably likely that they will.","In addition, over the weekend there was a consultation paper issued on NSFR. The proposal more closely aligns NSFR to the current evolved LTR framework in terms of definitions and assumptions, which is a positive step. And, based upon the proposal, we estimate that the firm is compliant today with NSFR.","Turning to business performance, let\u2019s start with the consumer and community banking on page six. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue with a return on equity of 20%. ","A couple of comments on drivers. We continue to make strong progress, as I said, on our customer satisfaction agenda, being recognized by the American Consumer Satisfaction Index for the second year running as number one among the largest banks, as well as number one in small business in three of four regions in the U.S. and number one among large banks for mortgage originations, both by JD Power.","On our retail branch network, we\u2019ve completed building out our key expansion markets, including California and Florida, and have reached leadership positions in each of our key markets. So we feel good about our footprint at or around this level of 5,600 branches plus or minus, and our focus from here is on optimization, including branch size and usage, and leveraging digital capabilities. ","Lastly, our other key business drivers continue to grow strongly, reflecting increased consumer engagement, evidenced by growth in deposits, investments, sales, and processing volumes. And our expenses are down nearly $700 million from last year, primarily due to lower mortgage bank expenses. Across CCB, we\u2019ve reduced headcount by 16,500 year over year.","Turning to page seven, consumer and community banking generated net income of $780 million and an ROE of 28% on net revenue of $4.4 billion, up 4% and flat with the prior quarter. Net interest income is up 3% year on year, driven by the continued strong growth in deposits, partially offset by spread compression. It\u2019s our investment in customer satisfaction, newbuilds, and CPC that is driving this deposit growth, and also the highest account retention rate in a decade. ","On the noninterest revenue side, we continue to see strong growth in both debit and investment revenue, with close to $190 billion of client investment assets, up 19% or $30 billion year over year, about half related to market performance and half due to net new money gains.","Expenses are up 3% year on year, reflecting costs relating to the strengthening of the control environment, but have flattened sequentially as we improve efficiency in our same store branches, with starting down by over 6,000 year over year.","Business banking loan balances are flat quarter on quarter and up 1% year on year, and production levels in the pipeline remain stable. However, the environment has been challenging throughout the year due to competitive pressures, and we\u2019ve maintained a high level of credit discipline. But we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll see small businesses start to spend some of their cash reserves in 2014, but growth may be back ended. ","Turning to page eight, mortgage banking, overall, mortgage banking net income was $562 million with an ROE of 11%. There are a couple of nonrecurring items this quarter, which I\u2019ll explain as we go through the results, but if you look at the top of the page, you\u2019ll see production [ex repurchases] with a reported pretax loss of $500 million. But if you look at the table at the top right, we\u2019ve adjusted for the one-time items, and you can see a loss of $91 million, slightly negative, as expected, and as we guided to. ","Revenues in the quarter were down 15% on lower application volumes, down 23%, and from a mix perspective, nearly 60% of loans were purchased loans this quarter, up from a little over 20% the same time last year.","Production expense includes approximately $400 million of non-MBS-related legal expense. This is part of the significant item on the front page. Again, adjusting for this, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of actions we\u2019ve taken to reduce expenses, with adjusted expenses coming down around $80 million quarter over quarter.","Dealing with repurchases, as you know, during the quarter we reached a settlement with the GSEs on agency repurchase exposure. After allowing for the settlement amount, we are releasing a net $130 million of repurchase reserves this quarter, with $90 million being added to compensatory fee reserves as the settlement did not cover these potential fees. ","And before moving on to servicing, just looking out to the first quarter of 2014, the overall mortgage market is estimated to be roughly flat versus the fourth quarter. And although we do expect to see some continuation in expense improvement, revenues will continue to be challenged. And we\u2019re guiding for the first quarter, similar to the last two quarters, to be slightly negative in pretax productions.","Moving to servicing, pretax income about breakeven in the quarter. Servicing expenses of $663 million includes that $90 million of compensatory fee expense that I just mentioned, which related to loans previously contemplated in the repurchase reserves. Adjusting for this item, our core expenses would have been slightly better than our previous guidance of $600 million for the quarter.","Finally, on real estate portfolio, pretax income of $1.2 billion, including chargeoffs of $167 million and a total reserve release of $950 million. The noncredit impaired reserve release for the quarter was $200 million, reflecting continued improvements in the portfolio, but at a lower rate, but also we released $750 million of reserves in the purchase credit impaired portfolio, given recent significant improvements in HPI forecasts of approximately 5% for our portfolio through 2015. ","Turning to page nine, [unintelligible] merchant services and auto, net income of $1 billion, up 23% year on year, with an ROE of 26% or 22% excluding reserve releases, reflecting underlying excellent performance in the business. Consumer spending has been increasing, and we\u2019re seeing strong growth in interchange revenue, reflecting growth in sales volume as well as seasonality in the fourth quarter.","Year over year, growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was consistently strong at 11% and 14% respectively, with average outstandings flat year over year and quarter over quarter, yields remaining healthy but lower than a year ago. ","We do continue to see runoff of high rate and low FICO balances, with a move towards more engaged customers or transactors, which is a positive trend for spend and for credit performance but a negative to yield, and we expect spread compression to continue into 2014.","Net revenues of $4.7 billion, down 3% year over year and up 1% quarter on quarter on seasonality, with a revenue rate of 12.34% for the quarter. Consistent with these portfolio trends, the net chargeoff rate has stayed at historical lows at 2.85% and we released $300 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, given improved delinquencies and portfolio seasoning.","Expenses are up 3% year on year, about 16% quarter on quarter, primarily driven by increased marketing investment spend and costs associated with payments to customers required by a consent order.","A few words on auto. Originations are up 16% year on year, driving loan balances up 5% year on year and outpacing new car sales growth of 5%. ","And before we move on, as you know, there were two data security breaches affecting our customers over the last several weeks. We took quick action to protect our customers, and we continue to monitor both situations. The financial impact for the quarter is not significant.","Moving on to slide 10 and the corporate investment bank, the CIB results this quarter include a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing the FVA, or funding valuation, framework, as well as a $0.5 billion DVA loss.","On this page, we\u2019ll focus on the numbers excluding FVA and DVA, in the table on the top right. And I\u2019ll come back to FVA on the next page. So you have net income of $2.1 billion on revenues of $8 billion and an ROE of 15%. And we maintained our number one ranking in both global IBCs and markets revenue, gaining share year over year of over 100 basis points in each.","In banking, total revenue of $3 billion, with IBC slightly ahead of our guidance. IBCs of $1.7 billion for the quarter up 11% quarter on quarter and down 3% year on year, driven by lower debt underwriting compared with a record prior year quarter, partially offset by strength in equity underwriting.","Treasury services revenue of $1 billion, down 7% year on year, driven primarily by the decision to reposition our trade loan portfolio.","Moving on to markets and investor services, our markets revenue of $4.1 billion was flat year on year, also slightly ahead of the guidance we provided in the fourth quarter. ","Fixed income markets revenues of $3.2 billion, flat year on year, with continued solid client flows. ","And equity markets of $873 million, down quarter on quarter off of a very strong equity derivatives result last quarter, as well as seasonality.","Security services revenue of $1 billion, up 3% year on year, primarily driven by higher custody and fund services revenue on record assets under custody of $20.5 trillion and also on higher deposits. ","Just a comment on credit. We continue to see a favorable credit environment with stable credit quality trends, and our provisions continue to benefit from repayments and recoveries. Expenses of $4.9 billion, down 2% both year over year and quarter over quarter, driven by lower compensation. ","The comp to revenue ratio, excluding FVA and DVA, was 27% for the quarter, in line with the same quarter last year and 30% for the full year, which is in line with our guidance, albeit at the lower end, on higher capital year over year. ","Loan balances are down 7% year on year, flat quarter on quarter, again primarily driven by trade loan balances, which could trend down or continue to trend down as we optimize the portfolio. And at the bottom of the driver section, VAR remains low at $42 million for the quarter.","Turning to page 11, and coming back to the FVA adjustment, we\u2019re recording a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing a funding valuation, or an FVA, framework for our OTC derivatives and structured notes this quarter, reflecting and industry migration towards incorporating the lifetime cost or benefit of unsecured funding into valuations.","Just a couple of minutes on the background and dealing with why now. To date, there\u2019s been no broad consensus that funding should be explicitly incorporated into valuation estimates. However, we believe that market practice for pricing and valuing derivatives has noticeably evolved during 2013 as we\u2019ve been actively and continuously evaluating the market. ","We\u2019ve now accumulated compelling evidence, both from transactions as well as industry pricing services, that dealers are pricing funding into uncollateralized derivatives with a degree of consistency. This supports incorporating an FVA framework this quarter.","In very simple terms, you can think of FVA, which represents a funding spread over LIBOR, as having the effect of present valuing market funding costs into the value of derivative receivables today. These funding costs otherwise would have affected net income over the life of the derivatives.","Although the FVA framework applies to both assets and liabilities, the adjustment in the quarter is largely related to uncollateralized derivative receivables for two reasons. First, the funding value of collateral is already incorporated in the valuation of collateralized derivatives, and second, credit spreads, which are a significant component of funding spreads, are already recorded on liabilities through DVA.","So in thinking about the size of the adjustments, you have to consider the size, the tenure, the composition of the relative portfolio, as well as the appropriate spread. To give you some context, if you start with derivative receivables net of cash and securities collateral of approximately $50 billion, apply an average duration of approximately five years and a spread of approximately 50 basis points, that accounts for about $1 billion plus or minus the adjustment.","Additionally, although there is a material overlap between DVA and FVA, the remaining difference contributes to the adjustment. So the loss in the quarter represents a transition adjustment to this new framework, and can be thought of a one-time event as we incorporate the concept into the portfolio value.","Going forward, FVA will be incorporated into day one valuation of derivatives and implementing FVA should have the effect of significantly reducing our sensitivity to funding spreads going forward. We\u2019ll continue to refine FVA as the framework matures within the industry. ","Moving on to page 12, the commercial bank saw a net income of nearly $700 million this quarter on revenue of $1.8 billion, with an ROE of 20%. Revenues were up 6% year on year and 7% quarter on quarter, net interest income increasing by 5% year over year, reflecting a one-time gain of approximately $100 million related to a lending-related workout.","Pricing spreads have continued to tighten across the board. Noninterest revenues were 8% up year on year, driven by record growth IBCs of over $500 million for the quarter. ","Our credit book continues to show very strong performance, with a net chargeoff rate of only 7 basis points, as we continue to focus on quality names and a comfortable parting on deals that don\u2019t meet our standards.","Expenses were up 9% year on year, continuing to reflect higher product and headcount related expenses, primarily in controls.","Loan balances were up 7% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter. Our commercial real estate businesses continued to outperform the industry, up 15% year on year, 16 consecutive months of growth. But in C&I, overall loan growth remains flat, performing slightly below the industry as client demand continues to be low, competition high, and we remain focused on credit discipline over growth.","While sentiment remains fragile, there are pockets of activity, and we are cautiously optimistic that borrowing demand may improve as confidence in the recovery spreads. But again, that may be back ended in the year as clients are very liquid.","Finally, deposits are up 3% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter, on seasonality.","Page 13, in asset management, continued strong investment performance and long term [unintelligible] drove the fourth consecutive year of record revenue. The quarter saw net income of $568 million, up 18% year over year, with an ROE of 25%. ","Record revenues of $3.2 billion, up 15% year on year, are driven by three main factors: strong fund performance as well as long term flows in every single asset class and from every region, overall benefitting from higher markets, and finally a mark-to-market gain from [received cash] on investment.","This is the 19th consecutive quarter of long term inflows, with $16 billion for the quarter, bringing the full year to a total of $90 billion, driving record assets under management of $1.6 trillion, up 12%.","We saw particular strength in multiasset and equities, and achieved number one ranking in 2013 for net flows in active long term mutual funds. ","Expenses increased in line with performance of the business. And finally, in banking we continue to see growth across the board, with record loan balances over $95 billion, up 19% year on year.","Page 14. A total net income of nearly $800 million for corporate and private equity for the quarter. In private equity, a relatively quiet quarter, with aggregate results more modest than in prior quarters.","Treasury CIO showed a net loss of $78 million, driven by negative NII of nearly $100 million. But that compares to a run rate of negative NII of approximately $500 million in each of the first two quarters. This improvement reflects the benefit of higher investment security deals, up 50 basis points. ","The investment securities portfolio has also been a significant contributor to firm-wide NIM stability, and in the second half of the year we deployed $66 billion growth in new investments, principally mortgages and munis.","Our ending balance of securities classified as held to maturity grew to $24 billion and will continue to grow this quarter. And you should expect CIO treasury NII to reach breakeven in the second half of 2014, all other things equal.","Before I continue, just let me talk for a second about NIM and NII, details of which are in the appendix. Firm-wide NIM, core NIM, and NII were all up slightly quarter over quarter, given market rates, and we expect both NIM and NII to be relatively stable in the near term, with the highest security deals I talked about being largely offset by loan spread compression.","Finally on this page are the corporate, sees a net income of $852 million, and there\u2019s a callout on the page. First, a net gain - all of these are after tax - of $800 million on the sale of Visa shares. We were, and we remain, a large Visa shareholder. However, in the quarter we saw the opportunity to risk manage approximately one-third of our Visa price risk exposure. But we clearly retain the ongoing litigation risks, both the ultimate amount and timing of the settlement.","Secondly, a net real estate gain of over $300 million on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and these two gains are being offset by nearly $800 million in legal expense, substantially all Madoff related. ","In addition, a few positive tax items in the quarter, largely the resupply reserves.","Page 15 in our outlook, to wrap up, we\u2019ve actually covered all of the items on this page. So wrapping up, just to say that our four leading franchises are all performing very strongly, and we remain focused on serving our clients. We\u2019re committed to accomplishing our control agenda and adjusting successfully to the new global financial architecture, and we look forward to diving deeper into all of these things at investor day, which is coming up in a few weeks\u2019 time.","With that, thank you, and operator, you could open up the line to Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Just wanted to talk about the leverage ratio for a moment. You talked about a 10 basis point increase from the latest on Basel, if they do the add-ons. And I guess the big part that\u2019s hardest for us to see is really the impact of the CDS non-netting of mismatched maturities on protection bought versus protection sold. Can you give us a sense of what your numbers look like on that basis, so we can try and reconcile to your 10 basis points?","Marianne Lake ","Just a quick thing, just to clarify, the 10 basis points is actually lower, not higher. It\u2019s a deduct not an add for the new Basel proposals relative to the U.S. rules. So remember, as we\u2019ve previously been [disclosing] our ratios, we used the U.S. proposed rules that referenced a prior Basel denominator. So it\u2019s a 10 basis point worsening.","And you\u2019re right that we had two major things contributing to that. We had a positive associated with better assumptions on draws on unfunded commitments, slightly more than offset by a negative on the [unintelligible] protection. We\u2019re still working through the final details, but our best estimate is that it\u2019s in the mid-20s in basis points, 25 basis points plus or minus.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And can you just give us a sense for what the maturity profile looks like on your CDS protection purchased versus sold? Is there much of a maturity mismatch there? Or is there really not much?","Marianne Lake ","If you start with our [gross growth] CDS protection [written], it\u2019s about $3.4 trillion. By the time you net that down for maturities, it gets down to a couple hundred billion dollars, but that\u2019s still impactful.","Jamie Dimon ","Another thing to think about, it will be manageable because this is kind of a static analysis, before we started running the business slightly differently due to it.","Marianne Lake ","Right. We saw the proposals as having been thoughtful. And we don\u2019t necessarily have to agree with the finer points of all of them, but it doesn\u2019t materially change our position or our our thoughts going forward. And as Jamie says, all of our businesses will now socialize and optimize against what we understand of the final rules, when the U.S. regulators adopt them.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","On the $60 billion of core expense that you pointed out, on balance having been pretty flat with last year, despite the increases in control environment costs, can you give us a sense of how you currently see that evolving in 2014?","Marianne Lake ","We\u2019re obviously going to do a bit more of a detailed deep dive on expenses over time at investor day. But for now, what we have said is that you should expect our adjusted expenses for 2014 to remain at or below that level of $60 billion. We also said that in 2014 the continuation of our control agenda is adding an incremental $1 billion over \u201913. So by remaining flat, we\u2019re effectively self-funding that $1 billion. Flat to down. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And how do you get comfortable that by doing that you\u2019re not going to eat into revenue growth, by starving other expenses?","Jamie Dimon ","We\u2019re not starving any expenses. We\u2019re just managing it in a disciplined way, the way we\u2019ve always done it. And if you look at the underlying numbers, there\u2019s a lot of growth in the underlying numbers. But it\u2019s clearly true that some of the derisking and spinning off OEP and physical commodities will affect revenues a little bit, but obviously profits less. ","Marianne Lake ","We\u2019ve always been investing in the businesses and been willing to invest where the business pace and the returns justify that. But we are also finding efficiencies in a combination of the businesses, both consumer and the wholesale businesses, efficiency in the same store branches we talked about. You know, CIB continues on its journey on the back office and front office integration, and obviously mortgage expenses will continue to trend down, both in line with improved credit trends and also as we proactively manage the portfolio. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but it\u2019s not at the expense of our willingness to invest in the businesses for returns. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And if I can follow up on the mortgage expense comment that you made, more just along the lines of the expenses against the origination franchise, it sounded to me like you may be extending your view of what the timeframe is to kind of get that to steady state, beyond the first quarter? Is that right, or am I misreading that?","Marianne Lake ","It\u2019s not just about expenses. I think you have to think about the whole equation. We\u2019ll see some improvement in the first quarter of 2014, and we\u2019ll also continue to work on expense efficiency in the business. But if you look at a market that is currently being estimated at about $1.3 trillion, down from $1.9 trillion - and honestly a couple of weeks ago it was $1.1 trillion, so it\u2019s a very small market, one we haven\u2019t seen the likes of since the year 2000 - in a market like that, it\u2019s very challenging to deliver through the cycle returns. So we went through, over the last few years, years with very strong revenues and margins, and we are in a challenging environment as we look into 2014. But we\u2019re working on it.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And the last one for me, you mentioned the impact of operating risk due to the very high level of litigation costs this year. How should we think about that, and how are you thinking about that, with respect to CCAR?","Marianne Lake ","The way to think about it in the short term relative to, say, the submission that we just did or in the near future, is that obviously a realized loss experience that is higher than we have previously seen informs your view and judgment as to what you could reasonably expect to happen in a future stress period. So it is fair to say that would drive our expectations for [unintelligible] on operational losses to be slightly higher. Having said that, it\u2019s not as if our previous submissions didn\u2019t contemplate there to be significant stresses in operating losses. So I would characterize it as incremental and certainly not from a low base. And also remember that every quarter we move forward we generate capital, improve our ratios, so there\u2019s lots of moving parts to the ultimate outcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. One was on NIM outlook. You did indicate that in the second half of \u201914 you were expecting that the CIO and treasury income would turn positive, if I read it correctly. And I would think that\u2019s a function of your security yields improving. Can you just give us a sense of what the new investment yield is for the security investments that you\u2019re making in that book right now relative to what the balances are at?","Jamie Dimon ","I think the way you\u2019re supposed to look at it is something like $40 billion gets reinvested a year. And the basic assumption you should make is an average duration of three or four years. So think of five-year bonds or something like that. And just use the implied yield curve. [unintelligible] munis or MBS or something like that. The other thing to point out is it\u2019s completely dependent upon the decisions we make. We can change that kind of at will if we want to extend or reduce the duration of equity at the company.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And so given your comments that you\u2019re expected to reach breakeven by the second half of \u201914, that\u2019s a reflection of higher interest rates, or a change in the way you\u2019re investing the funds? ","Jamie Dimon ","It\u2019s a little bit of both. It\u2019s mostly just the change in the yield curve.","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, we\u2019ll have slower mortgage repayments. We\u2019re able to reinvest at higher yields. We\u2019re reinvesting in high quality assets, munis at high spreads. So it\u2019s both.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then your other point was you\u2019re going to be taking that better return on that portfolio and using it to be as competitive as you want to be on the loan portfolio, and so expectation is that loan spreads will continue to pull down over the next couple of quarters at least. Can you just give us a sense as to how willing you are to be competitive on price in loan spreads? Should we be expecting that overall NIM compression is what you\u2019re looking for here in the event that you get the quality loan growth you want?","Jamie Dimon ","Well, you\u2019ve got to separate the loans. On the commercial side, we\u2019ll obviously be competitive, and we\u2019re not assuming anything heroic in terms of spreads getting worse or better. But they\u2019re low. You could argue down the road they might actually go up a little bit as capital requirements, liquidity requirements go way up. But we\u2019ll be competitive. We\u2019re assuming we\u2019ve got to be competitive in those spreads.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And on the consumer side, card balances have been rewritten post crisis to be variable. Are you anticipating that you\u2019re going to be in a rising rate environment, [in the belly of the curve], raising rates on card portfolio?","Jamie Dimon ","Think of the card business as we try to run it fully match funded, so the spreads are about the same. And just remember, something like 65% is at an interest rate, something like 40% is transactor almost locked in rates, which we also match fund.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then separate topic, just on the security breach that you discussed. You indicated that the card replacements that you\u2019ve done so far has been de minimis in terms of expense. But could you just speak about it a little bit bigger picture, how you\u2019re thinking about fraud in the card space as well as in the debit space?","Jamie Dimon ","We have replaced 2 million debit and credit cards I think by the end of this week, to protect our customers. Look, unfortunately, the cybersecurity, as we\u2019ve now pointed out for a year, is a big deal. It\u2019s not going to go away. And all of us have a common interest in being protected. So this might be a chance for retailers and banks to for once work together as opposed to sue each other like we\u2019ve been doing the last decade. But it\u2019s in all of our interest to do it, and I think all the people involved in this know that the third parties, whether it\u2019s machines, regional machines, your mainframes, you really have to put an extreme effort into protecting yourself. So this story is not over, unfortunately.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Right, and there\u2019s been this debate between tokenization versus chip and PIN, and I\u2019m just wondering do you guys have an angle as to which way you would prefer to see it go?","Jamie Dimon ","Honestly, I think you\u2019re going to see both. You\u2019re going to see chip and PIN in all cards, and then a lot of online type of transactions you\u2019re going to see tokenization. They both are very very good technologies to protect consumers and companies from fraud.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then just last question, on the Visa, did I hear you correctly, Marianne, that you basically realized a third of the economic value in the Visa shares that you have? Is that correct?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, that\u2019s correct.  ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","So two thirds left. And when you say economic, you\u2019re talking about net of any hedging?","Marianne Lake ","Correct.","Jamie Dimon ","There\u2019s an unrealized gain of approximately $3 billion today. It\u2019s on our books at zero. This goes back to when Visa was spun off many, many years ago.","Marianne Lake ","But that\u2019s right, Betsy, net of hedging.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","First question, on FIC in the IB. It\u2019s pretty stable this quarter. As a matter of fact, if you look for the year, it was about in line with last year, which I think once everybody\u2019s done reporting, it will be a pretty good victory. So I guess the question is, there\u2019s a bunch of structural headwinds blowing on the business, and as you do your budgeting - it\u2019s probably done already - can the industry grow with the headwinds on it? In other words, the offset would be better activity levels, steeper curve, things like that. But there\u2019s a bunch of structural headwinds. I\u2019m just curious how you think about it at the high level.","Jamie Dimon ","There are some structural headwinds. You\u2019ve seen a lot of adjustment in the marketplace. People have reduced the size of their inventory. But what you don\u2019t know going forward is what\u2019s going to happen to spreads. But I look at it a little bit like the sector\u2019s on a cyclical. There will be headwinds from regulations, etc., but over time assets that people need to manage and buy and sell are going to go up over time, not go down. So what happens in 2014 is hard to say. Our business is fairly diversified, between rates, credit, emerging markets, FX, commodities, etc., which is definitely helping that stability.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Maybe on a related note, I got a sense with the renewed focus on SLR that there\u2019s a renewed attention to compression trades. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s ongoing, and it could be material in 2014 as this goes on? I know there\u2019s a lot of work involved, but the reward is pretty good too. ","Marianne Lake ","I would say it\u2019s ongoing, and it will be benefit. I think material might be a stretch at this point. And it is a lot of work, as you say. So the whole industry is working on that, and us too. We expect it to be beneficial, but not a game-changer.","Jamie Dimon ","The SLR at 5% we do not think is going to be an issue for us. We\u2019ve barely begun to manage it. There are a lot of things you can do in how you change your business. The bank issue is a little bit different, but think of that as more structural. What we did in the bank over the last 20 years, and what we\u2019re not going to do in the bank going forward, that will take a little bit longer, but for other reasons. It just takes us longer to change our business model to accommodate it.","Marianne Lake ","I also think if you look at the other things I mentioned in terms of opportunities, putting NIM to one side, our estimate of the new Basel rule that we had, we\u2019ve given you a 10 basis point movement backwards, have a conservative estimate of what we could ultimately achieve over time in terms of the ability to net cash collateral for derivatives, just given certain of the conditions. But again, over time, that will also be manageable, like compression trades and like many of those other things. So we haven\u2019t changed our view. We can manage against these targets by doing it thoughtfully and methodically, and not having to [unintelligible].","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Last one for me. You\u2019ve noted you\u2019re 9.5% [unintelligible] tier one common, the 10% year-end target seems completely achievable given your earnings. I\u2019m just curious how you think about balancing the absolute versus the relative meaning. You can get there on an absolute basis no problem. On a relative basis, some other large financial institutions have a little bit more. Just curious if that matters as you talk about the capital planning process, or when you have enough, it\u2019s enough.","Marianne Lake ","We said already that we would be willing to run between 10% and 10.5%, so we\u2019re on a journey here. We think we can get 10% plus or minus by the end of this year. It could be plus and it could be minus. But we think that at this point, based on what we know, running at that level of buffer or margin should be enough. Obviously we\u2019ll be more informed as we go through CCAR processes, but that\u2019s our point of view at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","One more quick follow up on the net interest margin outlook. NIM expected to be flattish. But I wasn\u2019t clear if, in the current rate environment, you expected to continue to add investments as you have been doing. And would you expect the net interest income dollars to grow from here as they did slightly this quarter?","Marianne Lake ","I talked about the second half of the year growth, adding $66 billion. We\u2019ve never talked about the second quarter. We added quite a lot in the second quarter. And yes, we have plans to continue to do that in 2014. And yes, we expect our NII dollars to be relatively stable, possibly slightly up over the course of the first half of the year, but relatively stable.","Jamie Dimon ","And not [unintelligible] investments. If you look at the balance sheet today, we have almost $350 billion at central banks, mostly the Fed, another $350 billion of very high quality investment securities. And those two things combined equal our loans of $700 billion. So the company is very, very liquid. We don\u2019t really need to invest more. It depends on how much we grow deposits.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And what about just taking advantage of the 10-year yields moving up and your overall sensitivity to higher rates?","Jamie Dimon ","I already said what we\u2019re going to do is, what you should assume now is that there\u2019s implied yield curves and constant reinvestment, but if you had rates move up 100 basis points all at once, we probably would be much more aggressive in doing something like that.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then in terms of the litigation reserves, you resolved a number of large issues in the fourth quarter. So two questions here. Can you help us think about how the litigation provision expense might trend in 2014? Should we expect it to be lower than the $800 million? And then second, can you tell us if your range of possible loss has come down from the $6.8 billion that it stood at in October, since you resolved a few big items?","Marianne Lake ","Obviously you\u2019re going to understand the necessary caveat that we can\u2019t predict for you the pattern and the amount of legal expenses in any one quarter or over several quarters. However, it would be fair to say that we would certainly hope that for the full year the full year [unintelligible] the first quarter annualized, but we can\u2019t be certain of that. With respect to a reasonably possible loss range, it did come down from $5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter to $5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, given the legal expense [unintelligible].","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then the last thing is, you mentioned it a little bit, but can you just give us kind of a philosophy with which you approached this year\u2019s CCAR and how you\u2019re thinking about balancing your capital achievement goals on the ratios that you talked about with the goal of returning some capital to shareholders?","Marianne Lake ","We\u2019ve done a bunch of math. You can do it based on analysts\u2019 estimates. But if you think about we want to get to 10% plus or minus before the end of next year, all other things being equal, that is a priority, but it is not the only priority. And so as we think about our capital plan, we\u2019ve consistently said - obviously it\u2019s a board decision ultimately, and they\u2019ll contemplate them in the [unintelligible], of course - but we would like to have the flexibility to be able to potentially increase dividends and also have flexibility to be able to do reasonable repurchases. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for you to think about how we thought about this year as being relatively consistent with last.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Just a question on the announcement of the potential for selling the prepaid card business. I\u2019m just curious as to what drove that, given that it doesn\u2019t appear that it was a scale-related decision, given the size of that business relative to peers. But if you could just provide a little more color as to what you\u2019re seeing in that business and what caused you to potentially sell that business?","Jamie Dimon ","Every year we try to have a disciplined approach about what we stay in and what we don\u2019t, and I think we probably were more disciplined this year about the things we don\u2019t need, both from derisking, capital, management focus, controls, etc. If you look at the prepaid card business, we\u2019re not dealing directly with customers. It\u2019s kind of secondary. It\u2019s a complex business, and we were just better off letting someone else do it. It won\u2019t affect the four main franchises that Marianne spoke about, that are doing so well. It was just kind of a product we used to do, and so we\u2019re not going to do it anymore. And there\u2019s a lot of risk associated with it.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then just moving on to your comments about being potentially cautiously optimistic about back-end growth for loans, presuming that that\u2019s mostly focused on commercial lending. Is it still your view that the canary in the coal mine for seeing that might be slower deposit growth, or in fact negative deposit growth, before you start to see loan growth?","Jamie Dimon ","We didn\u2019t use the word cautiously optimistic, we\u2019re using the word optimistic, because we are actually optimistic. You have a U.S. economy starting to grow. You will see loan growth and volume growth across all of these businesses. We are actually optimistic about the U.S. economy in particular. We spend a lot of time analyzing what rising rates, growth, change of QE3, [unintelligible] will do to the deposits. So it might actually have a diminishing effect on the growth of deposits. But we\u2019re happy, [whether we\u2019re] still growing share. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to see deposits going negative before you see loan growth. I think you\u2019re trying to fine tune it too closely there.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Fair enough. And then just finally, in terms of your outlook for card balances, just trying to take some of the fourth quarter seasonality out of that business, that they have sort of bottomed in terms of the overall balances. Are you equally optimistic for those balances to begin to grow in 2014? Or are you still looking at sort of flattish balances through most of 2014?","Marianne Lake ","Remember that in our card business we have both dynamics of core [unintelligible] as well as still some continued runoff. We did reach the inflection point during the second half of 2013 where that runoff was no longer exceeding growth. And so we\u2019re set to grow, but very modestly, in 2014.","Jamie Dimon ","But more importantly, 93% of the business is rewards. We\u2019ve had 10% growth in spend, we\u2019ve had 14% growth in merchant processing. So we are very happy with the card business. It\u2019s performing exceptionally well, excellent credit trends. So outstanding growth is less important, but obviously we\u2019d like to see some of that too.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then just finally for me, given some of the security breaches, not only in your cards but across a couple of other issuers, have you seen any reduction in consumer spending, potentially related to that via cards, moving to other forms of purchases? ","Jamie Dimon","No. Just a little bit relating to Target, but not in general. And a lot of that card growth is coming from P&E and travel and restaurants and things like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","Regarding expenses, can you remind us where we stand on headcount reductions through \u201913 and then where you stand in terms of on track for \u201914?","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, just to remind you what we said back in February last year, in the consumer businesses we talked about over the two years, so \u201913 and \u201914, mortgage seeing headcount reductions of 13,000 to 15,000, and the consumer businesses, predominantly in the branches, of 4,000. ","By the end of 2013, we had seen 16,500 in total. So in the consumer bank, we\u2019ve actually not only accelerated, but outperforming our expectations in terms of our ability to run those branches efficiently and still maintain very strong customer satisfaction and retention rates. ","And then in the mortgage space, we have seen total headcount down 11% year over year against that 13,000 to 15,000 two-year target. So obviously we continue to work on the strategy and the size and our approach to the mortgage market, but obviously relative to those numbers, there\u2019s still a little way to go. ","And remember that that was both production and servicing. What you saw, given the rate environment in the middle of 2000 and the second half of 2013, is that some of the production related headcount reductions were accelerated. We still have meaningful improvement expected in terms of delinquencies and foreclosures and modifications that will continue to drive costs and headcount down in \u201914.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then in terms of the retail branch banking discussion that you had mentioned you\u2019re kind of comfortable with the 5,600 branches level that you\u2019re at now, and you\u2019re focused on optimization going forward, does that imply that you could see additional headcount reductions or shrinkage of the branch network or square footage, as we\u2019ve seen from others? How should we think about that?","Marianne Lake ","Talking about the number of branches, I would think about the fact that, like all those sort of retail distributions, houses will continue to do consolidations and relocations as it makes sense for us to do that in our footprint, and we\u2019ll continue to respond to customer preferences, which will mean that over the course of the next decade, we\u2019ll be looking at obviously the size of new branches, as branches come up for renovation and release and things like that. But we\u2019re not expecting a material change in the number as a macro matter. So 5,600 plus or minus. And it is going to be based on customer preferences. ","As it relates to headcount reductions, we\u2019re already aggressively looking at the efficiency in our same store branches, and have been very successful. So we are looking at staffing models, physical capabilities, automation. We\u2019re on that journey, and we continue to be on it. But I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s going to be step change relative to our previous expectations. We\u2019ve already exceeded them. There might be some more, but it\u2019s not a step change.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then lastly, just on credit quality, it feels like, obviously still meaningful reserve releases, so largely in consumer, but is there much left to go in terms of cards or commercial? Is that kind of inflecting, if you will, in terms of the degree of credit leverage that may still be there in terms of reserve release? How should we think about that?","Marianne Lake ","Let\u2019s start with commercial and say it\u2019s plus or minus zero at this point. So I think it\u2019s going to be [strong] for long, but that\u2019s not really going to be a reserve story for a little while. In the card business, we had been talking about potentially reached bottom for a period of time. We haven\u2019t yet, or it doesn\u2019t seem we have. ","So as we look into 2014, if things do continue to strengthen, it\u2019s possible there will be some more releases, but not at the levels that you saw in 2013, so in the first couple of quarters. And usually the first quarter is very instructive on that point. Usually that\u2019s when you see a material improvement, if there\u2019s going to be one, in terms of [unintelligible] rates. ","And then on the mortgage space, two things. We have $2.6 billion of NCI reserves left. We talked before about the fact that we think our more steady run rate number will be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. So there\u2019s another $1 billion or $1.5 billion to come in that space over the course of the next year or so, potentially. Obviously, environment allowing. ","And then on the purchase credit impaired portfolios, we have $4.2 billion left after the two releases we just took. But remember that it\u2019s a life of loan portfolio. So something would have to change now in the environment, improve, for us to expect to take more releases. It\u2019s possible, but we don\u2019t expect to be taking releases up to that $4.2 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Last quarter you had some tax benefits. Did you have tax benefits this quarter? And can you quantify those?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, we did have some tax benefits this quarter. We had about $300 million after tax related to a number of items. State and local tax, some reserve releases. Not one particular thing.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And what was the loan utilization rate for wholesale or commercial loans?","Marianne Lake ","It was just a little over 30%. So low thirties. No change.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And you said the number of branches shouldn\u2019t change a whole lot. If I recall, from an investor day, you had planned on opening a lot of new branches. I thought it was going to be a net increase. So is this a change in your expectations?","Jamie Dimon ","Yes.","Marianne Lake ","Yes, so we said, I think, at investor day, plus 100, plus or minus, in a year, when Gordon spoke earlier in 2013. We\u2019ve revisited based upon our assessment of customer preferences and activity and think we\u2019ve got to the footprint where we are happy at 5,600 plus or minus.","Jamie Dimon ","If you look at that back presentation, Gordon goes essentially through branches, branch size, technology, headcounts, and why.","Marianne Lake ","Yes, so if you look at that, and then also obviously at investor day we\u2019ll go through it some more. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And then the more general question is, for your outlook you said that NII should be kind of flat, mortgage a little bit lower, and expenses only about flat or maybe lower from that $60 billion, after you eat that extra $1 billion. So it makes a difference how optimistic you are. If you\u2019re not optimistic, you might want to cut expenses more. And if you are optimistic, maybe you assume that fees are going to grow a lot more, because I know you were going to have positive operating leverage. So how do you see revenues growing faster than expenses? Is it the fees picking up? Is it expenses going lower? Or how do you get there? ","Marianne Lake ","It\u2019s a bit of both. Just one thing on mortgage, just a tiny clarification. We expect mortgage production to be broadly the same, as we\u2019ve seen in the second half, but we would expect to see continued improvement in the expense base in the servicing business. But having said all of that, it\u2019s a combination of relatively stable but potentially slightly higher NII. Yes, strength in fees on the basis of the strong driver growth that we talked about, and then our $60 billion or less of expenses. So we\u2019re working through all of the efficiency opportunities across the businesses, including in the retail space, to be able to deliver positive operating leverage.","Jamie Dimon ","I think the way you should look at it too is each of our businesses is always trying to drive efficiency while investing. That doesn\u2019t change any particular year. That\u2019s kind of a nonstop kind of thing. And you see those efficiencies, because every business has pretty good margins after investing. And sometimes the revenue growth itself is either episodic or the timing isn\u2019t exactly the same as you invest. But if you see the drivers, which is deposits, investible assets, asset management, number of corporate clients, market shares, they\u2019re all pretty positive. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Can you just give us a general sense of your outlook for CIB? In the past you\u2019ve given us a little bit more detail, future expectations. How do you think 2014 is going to be for capital markets? What\u2019s your backlog like right now, and why did you lower VAR if your more optimistic?","Jamie Dimon ","Well, VAR itself as a calculation is based on a whole bunch of different things. We don\u2019t deliberately lower VAR. ","Marianne Lake ","With VAR, it really is just a feature of two things. If you look at our look back period for VAR, across asset classes, we\u2019re at very low levels of volatility. Just across all the asset classes. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving it. If volatility picks up, that could pick up. We\u2019re not driving that down. And it\u2019s also derisking in SVP. That is a little bit proactive, but it\u2019s obviously mostly done now. ","Jamie Dimon ","If you stay with the volatility like it was 18 months ago, VAR itself would be like 60 or 70, just all on its own. So without changing your position. You know, the hardest business to get a handle on is CIB in terms of the short run. But what we see is investors still have to buy and sell securities. Corporations have ECM and DCM. And you can predict the rolloff, etc. The backlogs are pretty good. You saw a tremendous amount of IPOs in 2013. You saw a lot of debt financings. You\u2019ve already seen a bunch of M&A earlier this year. ","So we don\u2019t budget or plan that you\u2019re going to have an unbelievable year in CIB. But if you ask me, the long term prospects are good. It\u2019s probably the business has to go through the most adjustments to the new regulatory environment, but the long term prospects are pretty good. ","Our margins are good, our returns are good. Our comp level is at 30%, down from 38% a couple of years ago, really reflecting higher capital, etc. But at that comp level, we can pay our people well, grow the franchise, grow around the world, serve our clients, and still get decent returns.","So we feel very good about the business, and one of these days, it\u2019s going to boom. And you can guess just like I can guess when that might happen, but it will happen one day. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And then lastly, as it relates to Volcker, you said it should not hurt the results materially going ahead. In the past you said that it might hurt a billion dollars. That was a few years ago. And then another time you said it might even help. I know that was different management at the head then. But now you don\u2019t think it should impact things too much?","Jamie Dimon ","Volcker, all things being equal, we would say not much. I think when we referred to the $1 billion or $2 billion, we were talking about regulations in general, including derivatives, [SES], clearing houses, and Volcker. And that number, we still kind of have in the back of our mind, but it\u2019s hard to tell what the effect of all those things are. The $1 billion to $2 billion I would say was probably in the conservative category.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And how much of that would be reflected already?","Jamie Dimon ","That\u2019s the one that\u2019s hard to tell. ","Marianne Lake ","It\u2019s very difficult to back [test], because these things are all interrelated. But it\u2019s not entirely possible to disentangle everything. But obviously we\u2019ve gone through some changes in 2013. Some of that will be reflected. But this is a number that we would expect to be reflected, to the degree that it is at all, over the course of the next two years. ","Jamie Dimon ","And remember, some of those things reduce capital requirements. Some people are making dramatic changes in their business models, which may free up market share for those of us that have additional market share. So it all remains to be seen.","Marianne Lake ","And that was also a static analysis.","Jamie Dimon ","Some things may reprice a little bit because of the capital liquidity requirements around them. So it all remains to be seen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Just had two quick follow up questions. The first is on the expectations for the expense base in CCB. If you take out that $400 million in legal expenses, you\u2019re looking at a run rate of $6.9 billion. As you think about where the tailwinds could be for expenses for this year, is it fair to assume that that $6.9 billion quarterly run rate could improve throughout the year this year?","Marianne Lake ","I would just reiterate what we previously said, which is if you look at servicing, and in particular the quarterly run rate, which is call it $600 million, in line with our expectations, that\u2019s going to continue to trend down towards $500 million by the end of this year in 2014. And then on the production side, while we obviously are going to see our expenses, to a degree, variable with the size of the market, we\u2019re continuing to also work on opportunities to make the fixed cost base more efficient. So hopefully we\u2019ll deliver some of that in 2014 too. And we\u2019ll do a more precise job of [unintelligible] around that at investor day.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then just a quick other follow up is a follow up to Guy\u2019s question on operational risk capital. You mentioned that there was a 50 basis point haircut due to litigation. Assuming that you\u2019re not going to have similar outsized litigation expense going forward, is that 50 basis point something that you can eventually recoup? And how long would that take?","Marianne Lake ","That\u2019s an excellent question. I would say, assuming we have no significant losses going forward, then we feel like we should be close to our high point, albeit there may be a little bit more in the first half of 2014. ","Just two comments on operational risk. The first is, unlike market and credit risk, although all of the parameters and the confidence levels are effectively the same, it doesn\u2019t naturally recalibrate itself to changes in the business environment, or to your business mix or model, if you structurally reduce risk. It\u2019s very backward-looking, and in that sense it differs because it doesn\u2019t recalibrate.","And so as a result, if you just let the models continue to predict, based on historical losses going forward, you would need to be carrying that elevated level of operational risk capital forward for a reasonably long time. It\u2019s a one in a thousand year horizon. So think about it in terms of five, ten years, not one or two years. ","And so for that reason, we are very interested and working very hard with the industry to try and figure out how to better model changes in the business environment and to model and defend structural and permanent risk changes in our businesses in order to be able to recoup some of that more quickly. But at this point, I would characterize that as work that has not yet been done that is in progress, and so for the foreseeable future it will be elevated. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","If we just add up some of the odds and ends of the businesses that you\u2019re getting out of for the niche products and the impact of Volcker, is it still a relatively modest amount in aggregate? I think last quarter you had said maybe a few hundred million of revenue give up from the businesses that you\u2019re tweaking. And I just wanted to know if that still holds, and if we overlay Volcker, kind of what the all-in number might be.","Marianne Lake ","Okay, so put Volcker to one side for a second. We didn\u2019t update, obviously, the list. We\u2019re going to do that at investor day. We thought about that for you. It\u2019s probably more important to think less about revenue but more about the impact on the bottom line given that some of these businesses may not have been returning [unintelligible], and may have been in investment phase and actually not be breaking even. ","So I think it\u2019s safe to say that if you consider the impact on the bottom line more so than revenues, it\u2019s relatively modest, and we\u2019ll do work to update you on that. But remember it also is going to do two things, release capital, which will be a positive, and also improve the quality of the businesses and the control environment and the complexity, which will all be positive too. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And then just separately, as you think about kind of potential legal uncertainties or risk going forward, are there a couple that you kind of flag out there that are the ones that we should be watching most closely for the industry, for you guys, like whether it\u2019s LIBOR or FX? It feels like you\u2019ve obviously settled a lot on the mortgage side, a couple of the other big ones that were specific to you? What should we be watching to make sure we have a sense of what\u2019s going on? ","Jamie Dimon ","The ones you all mentioned. We put them on our 10-K.","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, it\u2019s the ones you mentioned. And if you look at our disclosures on the 10-Q, every quarter the items that we think raise themselves to levels of public disclosure are in that document. So look to last quarter and next quarter and you\u2019ll see. But we shouldn\u2019t comment specifically.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And nothing maybe [unintelligible] coming out in the 10-K versus the third quarter Q?","Jamie Dimon ","I don\u2019t think so.","Marianne Lake ","No, not at this point. But obviously the K is a few weeks away.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","On that question about the operational risk capital, isn\u2019t it kind of double or triple counting against you when you\u2019ve got an $8 billion reserve, which actually reduces your capital, and is it fair to say you don\u2019t get credit for that $8 billion in your capital base when you think about that operational risk capital?","Marianne Lake ","If you think about the basis for capital and put aside whether you like the way it works in a modeled environment, your reserves are for your expected losses, and your capital is for your unexpected losses. So in theory you shouldn\u2019t get explicit credit for them. ","I think the bigger point for us is if you look at the sorts of things that are driving our capital levels to be as elevated as they are, they are things, for example, like the PLMBS issues, and also certain of the very large mortgage, DOJ, international mortgage settlement, ISFR, [unintelligible] issues. ","It\u2019s our belief that this firm is not exposed today, or will not be exposed going forward, to those levels of risk at anywhere near that scale going forward. But as I said, we have no ability at this point to scale those back, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re very focused on. ","So it\u2019s less really about whether we\u2019re getting credit for our reserves, and a little bit more about how we try, in the industry, to evolve the framework in partnership with the regulators and defend over time that there are structural risk reductions that mean those risks are no longer present in that sale. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","Got it. So in the short run, the fact that you settled actually increases the operational risk, but you hope that over the longer term it will decrease it.","Marianne Lake ","Yes.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","You had made a brief comment about the equities results, about the comparable periods being higher. Were there any other reasons that equity trading results were kind of down as much as they were?","Marianne Lake ","Not specifically. We did fairly well in cash, but our cash platform is not as mature as some others. So I think we would characterize the performance as good, but coming off of, as I said, a very strong quarter for equity derivatives in the third quarter.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","And then any other areas - Gordon Smith has presented a few times and talked about kind of derisking some of his businesses - that we should be looking at for sales?","Marianne Lake ","On page 15, I think, last quarter we showed you a bunch of things that we were working on. We didn\u2019t replace the page, because it\u2019s not meaningfully changed. That\u2019s not to say that at the margins we don\u2019t continue to look at our businesses in terms of simplification and derisking. So I would say that while there may be things at the margin that we will explore over time, then there\u2019s nothing structurally big that you should be aware of. And again, we\u2019ll do some more of that for you at investor day. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","You mentioned that your utilization rate in the commercial area is in the low 30% range presently. You also pointed out that you\u2019re optimistic about the U.S. economy for this year being stronger, and then the positive impact it will have on loan demand. What do you think the utilization rate could get to by year-end?","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019m going to do just middle market, because that\u2019s the one that\u2019s kind of at a 30%. Years ago, it used to average a little more like 45%. It looks like, to us, that what you have is they have a lot more deposits, and a lot less utilization. And so obviously they\u2019re going to use some of their own money before they borrow against a revolver or something like that. And one day, you would expect it to go up. We\u2019re not guessing it\u2019s going to happen in 2014. But I would say we\u2019ll be sitting here one day, when we\u2019ve had a very strong economy, it will be 10 points higher.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Good. And then on the commercial real estate, as you guys pointed out, you\u2019re having real good success in this area. What geographic regions of the country are you seeing the best success? And then second, what product types are you finding are working the best in growing that book?","Jamie Dimon ","Well, multifamily is a big portion of that. I would say the major cities is pretty much where you\u2019d say it, son it\u2019s hard to answer specifically. I think both the multifamily, and other than real estate loans, it\u2019s really the big cities. ","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","You also mentioned that you guys have about $350 billion on deposit at the Fed. If the Fed decides to eliminate the interest they pay on those deposits to all the banks, would that change your strategy of keeping that amount up at the Fed?","Jamie Dimon ","Sure. I mean, you know, change either that, or how you reimburse clients for deposits, and obviously it will go into how you price and run your business. We\u2019re not expecting that to happen, but obviously we would do that. And you have other alternatives. You might invest some of that money elsewhere. ","Marianne Lake ","And it\u2019s also important to point out that a large portion of that $350 billion are deposits or cash that we would consider to be client nonoperational deposits. And as a result, we don\u2019t give ourselves any liquidity value for those. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting the [unintelligible] at the Fed.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And I may have missed this, but in the card merchant and services auto business, the noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter jumped up to $2.2 billion from the prior quarter\u2019s $1.9 billion. They\u2019ve been flat for the prior three quarters. Any particular reason why there was a jump?","Jamie Dimon ","Mostly marketing.","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, it\u2019s predominantly marketing. And with respect to marketing, it can be lumpy quarter to quarter. So it\u2019s not an unexpected number for us. It\u2019s just higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third.","Jamie Dimon ","We feel like we\u2019ve been doing a good job at card acquisition of high quality cards. You see that number, but it\u2019s up quite a bit. So we have some good, active programs out there.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","It looked like in the quarter that you guys bought back about $300 million worth of your stock in this quarter. And since the last CCAR, it\u2019s just over $2.2 billion. If I recall, you have an approval for $6 billion. Is it fair to assume that you\u2019ll use the next quarter to fill out the rest of that $6 billion? Or is that too optimistic?","Jamie Dimon ","Way optimistic.","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, I think that would be optimistic. Obviously we\u2019ll determine the first quarter, as we go through it, we\u2019ll have our [unintelligible]. That\u2019s certainly our expectation, and there may be some more, but I don\u2019t think you should expect us to catch up completely.","Jamie Dimon ","Remember, we want to meet our own objective, the 9.5% or 10%, and obviously the litigation costs hurt our ability to do a little bit of that, so we caught up on that. And also, the stock price is a lot higher than it was when we talked about the best way to buy back some stock. So we always look at that as the important thing. We don\u2019t just buy back stock regardless of price. Not that we think it\u2019s a bad price, but when it was at $33 a share or whatever, that was an extraordinarily compelling price.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","You also gave us a little bit of guidance of what we should expect for this year\u2019s CCAR, maybe similar to what you did last year. Should we look at it as what you were approved for, or what you actually executed in the repurchases of better guide numbers, since they are quite a bit different?","Jamie Dimon ","The board will decide when the time comes, when they look at all the priorities, etc.","Marianne Lake ","I would just reiterate what I said before, which is getting to our target ratios is a priority, but it\u2019s not the only one. We\u2019ll have to see how things play out in 2014. But if you do the math, then you can take your own estimates of what you think we\u2019ll earn next year. We should be able to also have the opportunity to take it to buy more than just [unintelligible], so we want that flexibility. That\u2019s what we [submitted] for, and we\u2019ll obviously manage through each quarter as we see it.","Jamie Dimon ","And it may depend on what we sell, how much we can mitigate, what the final rules are and stuff. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Derek De Vries of UBS.","Derek De Vries - UBS ","Just had a few housekeeping questions left. I think you mentioned the mark-to-market gain in asset management revenues? I\u2019m wondering if you can just quantify that so we can figure that out for our forecast? ","Marianne Lake ","It\u2019s just a little less than $100 million.","Derek De Vries - UBS ","And then on the investment bank, on the comp to income ratio, that\u2019s clearly at the right end of your guidance. I\u2019m just wondering, has there been any change in the deferred versus expense this year? And then related, do we enter 2014 with a similar amount of awarded not yet expensed?","Jamie Dimon ","There\u2019s no change.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey "," ","I just wanted to follow up on the loan growth expectations. If we adjust for the typical seasonality associated with the credit card loans, which obviously is high in the fourth quarter, it looks like your core growth rate in loans was something like 60 or 70 basis points sequentially, which would obviously translate into roughly a 2.5% annual growth rate.","Marianne Lake ","Are you talking about total and core? Or are you talking about reported and card?","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","I\u2019m talking about reported. So it just seems like the 2.5% seems like a fairly robust figure, so I just want to get your view about what the run rate of core loan growth might be.","Marianne Lake ","I\u2019m going to try and answer the question, and tell me if I don\u2019t. If you look at our actual total loans for the whole firm year over year, our growth reported was 0.6%, so call it just shy of 1%. But underlying that, the core loan growth was about 4%. So I think that as we look forward, we expect core growth to continue at or stronger than those levels. We\u2019ve reached, as we say in card, the point where, seasonality aside, that inflection point where we should expect net modest growth. ","And as I said, we\u2019re going to have to all wait and see how client demand plays out in small business in the middle market space, but we are hoping that at the second half of 2014, when the confidence in the economic recovery, we have confidence that when others join us, they will actually start to borrow and spend. ","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","So it sounds like, continuing along this trajectory, with potential strength in the back half of next year? ","Marianne Lake ","Yes, that\u2019s our hope.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that back to the NII dollar expectations, which seem fairly flat. But if the loan growth continues fairly strong, and the expectation is to continue to play capital into securities opportunistically, and the CIO portfolio is approaching breakeven, why is the expectation not for a stronger net interest income dollar growth?","Marianne Lake ","Because we talked earlier about the fact that we\u2019ve been seeing, and we expect to continue to see, some spread compression in loans that, at this point, in the near term - and we didn\u2019t talk about the whole year for 2014, but in the near term - we\u2019re expecting the improvement that we would see as a result of higher yields on investment securities, etc., to be largely offset by the compression in loan growth.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","Just two final followups. On the commitment side, as you talked about adjusting the trade book, and as we see the commitments continue to come down, how aggressively are you focusing on the commitment side from here in terms of balancing the long term growth potential versus the risk weightings and capital build?","Jamie Dimon ","The way to look at that is that what drives the company is serving clients, and so we don\u2019t target, you know, just when we get rid of commitments or something like that. But obviously we\u2019ve asked all the people and businesses to start to optimize a little bit commitments, balance sheet, LCR, SLR, Basel III. And so you\u2019ll probably see a little bit of a squeeze in commitments as they do that. But not at the expense of trying to do a good job for clients.","The other thing that I should point out is some of those commitments are much more capital or liquidity hogs than others. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see a little bit more of the squeeze. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","And then just one follow up on the fixed income side within that comment earlier about the runoff businesses. Is there a way you can update how we should think about the potential sale of physical commodities and what proportion it is of the $15.5 billion of FIC revenues this year, and Marianne, to your point about how that is in a relative profitable sense? ","Marianne Lake ","Let\u2019s talk about last year. If you look at 2013 reported, you would have seen that our commodities revenues counted for in the low teens of our markets revenues, but that\u2019s on an accounting basis. So that\u2019s just a revenue [chore] only. So if you think about the economic revenue, because obviously there\u2019s some accounting growth [unintelligible], much smaller number than that. So call it mid single digit, mid to 6-7%. But then it was a business that was in a combination of being built out, so it wasn\u2019t fully mature. And also, we\u2019re selling parts of the business that are highly [unintelligible] intensive to us. So think about the impact on the bottom line as being considerably more modest and with some capital benefits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ","Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to talk a little bit about your mortgage origination platform. It looks like you dropped from about $40 billion to about $23 billion, and your overall market dropped like 25%, and that\u2019s like a 40% drop, which drops probably your market share to low 8%. Can you add some color to that? Is that just mainly a function of the refis going away? Should we see an increase in market share down the road?","Marianne Lake ","A couple of things. First of all, if you just take the second half versus the first half, we said that we thought that the overall market would be down 30% to 40%. It was down about 33%. So it was in line with our expectations. And our performance was in line with that too. So you\u2019ve got to remember that the revenue versus loan volume, and how that gets recognized, is some timing differences. ","With respect to market share, if you look backwards into \u201913, the overall size of the market was revised up, which means that our market share was, all other things being equal, just relatively revised down, doesn\u2019t change anything. But going forward, our market share will be a factor of obviously the size of the market, but also our pricing discipline to make sure that we want to get an appropriate risk adjusted return. So we would gain share, but only if we can do it getting paid for the risk and the cost of servicing. ","Jamie Dimon ","And the whole reduction was refi.","Marianne Lake ","And the whole reduction was refi. I should say that, yes.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","","And I know you don\u2019t want to make any comments about political figures, but now that we\u2019ve got Mel Watt coming to town, there\u2019s probably going to be more focus on extending the credit box than we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, where most companies don\u2019t want to really get away from high FICO, high credit quality product. Do you think that Watt can be successful in opening the credit curve? And what type of things would you want to hear where you would start extending the credit box?","Jamie Dimon ","I would say that people in the business have been slowly extending the credit box. I\u2019m talking about over the last 18 months. If you look at LCVs, if you go to different cities. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to see a dramatic expansion of the credit box, because all the rep and warranty, all the litigation and stuff like that, for anything that\u2019s not qualified mortgages. ","Marianne Lake ","And the qualified mortgages, you know, credit is available. GSE is 90% LTV. On the Ginnie Mae side, you know, close to 100% LTV. So there\u2019s credit availability, you just have to have the ability to pay.","Jamie Dimon ","And FHA will set its own policy, but even there I think people are going to have a much tighter underwriting than the FHA guidelines, because of how much FHAs cost people.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca ","The first one, really I suppose, goes back to Sunday and the news that came out [Basel]. For the last 16 quarters, we\u2019ve been talking about regulation and you\u2019ve often been quite aggressive in talking about the impact of some of that regulation. But it seems like we\u2019ve reached a tipping point on Sunday, whereby we\u2019ve set back from those rules that were suggested in June and came out with something that was sensible, but actually also was going to support the growth of your business, and indeed the growth of the economy. Do you think we\u2019re actually at the stage now where we can actually feel that we\u2019ve got over the worst of the regulation and we can now actually get on with running our and your businesses?","Jamie Dimon ","I think we know for the most part the contours of the regulation at this point. Some of the fine tuning still needs to be done. So I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of banks globally adjusting to the new financial architecture. And the effect of that will be different in different parts of the world. It\u2019s slightly different for certain products, but it will probably be okay in total. It\u2019s nice to have the rules, to live with them, and now we\u2019ve got to push them down and understand them in a little more detail.","Marianne Lake ","There\u2019s still a few things we\u2019re waiting for. I mean, long term debt requirements, something to look out for in the first quarter. But having more clarity is definitely helpful.","Jamie Dimon ","You\u2019re seeing some people make bigger strategic changes, some are making just small tactical changes. And then we\u2019re going to report a lot more what we think the effect of all this is at investor day.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca ","And the second question really relates down to the mix of your investment banking revenues. Clearly what we\u2019ve seen is obviously the downward pressure on fixed income for some time now, for a whole bunch of reasons, some of which you\u2019ve touched on. But I suppose what a lot of people are talking about is that fixed income will no longer be quite the dominant part of the revenue pool for big investment banks, as it was. But in your case, and one or two other people, obviously it\u2019s very important business. Is your view, and perhaps don\u2019t just talk about yourself, but the really big players, the very successful players in fixed income, would actually probably be seeking to take share in what is going to be a smaller pot going forward?","Jamie Dimon ","I look at it a little bit different. I look at it like the pot will change and adjust to the new world, but from there it will probably grow. Because if you look at underlying numbers, the amount of investable assets around the world is going to double over 10 years, the amount of needs of corporations and sovereigns and supernationals, and ECM\/DCM advice will double over 10 years. ","So there will be a strong underlying business. Spreads, products, those things have always changed. Spreads have been coming down my whole life, and yet we have a healthy business. So we expect that fixed income, after some adjustment, will be a good business. We think a lot of these trends are cyclical, not secular, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re positioned for it.","It is possible that, if people leave, and certain things reprice\u2026 All businesses have to have a normal return on capital for the average player, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t exist. So we do think you\u2019ll see some of that. There will be pieces at the [unintelligible] banks, which is fine.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","I had a couple of questions regarding the Basel SLR. Specifically, Marianne, I wanted to clarify a comment you had made earlier, where it sounded as though you expect the U.S. regulators to adopt the revised Basel framework from over the weekend as a final SLR calculation approach. And I didn\u2019t know if that guidance was in the context of the higher 5% SLR requirement, which is being imposed on the U.S. [unintelligible].","Marianne Lake ","The reality is, I don\u2019t know any more than you do. I just think that given the changes that were made, it seemed to be positive and constructive. There\u2019s reason to believe that the U.S. regulators would want to leverage that. I could be wrong. And obviously we did comment letters on the U.S. NPR, but I\u2019m not aware of any specifics on the [quotient].","Jamie Dimon ","I\u2019d just add that if you listen to what the regulators said, not this time but going back, they intended to make Basel and U.S. rules common. About the rules. They did not say they intended to have the same percent. So we\u2019re just assuming the 5% is going to [stay]. And we think there will be a couple of other adjustments going forward too.","Steven Chubak - Nomura ","And then just looking at both the risk based and leverage based ratios, it sounds as though for the SLR there are a lot of mitigation opportunities at your disposal. On a pro forma basis, which ratio do you anticipate will represent the binding constraint on capital return going forward?","Marianne Lake ","If you look at the total firm consolidated, then they actually [unintelligible] this quite nicely, if you think about our target for Basel tier one common at 10% or 10.5% and a leverage target of 5% or 5.5%. So I think the leverage ratio feels like, as a consolidated matter, it\u2019s a simple fact [unintelligible] as it\u2019s supposed to be, not a binding constraint. The devil\u2019s in the details. As you push that down, as I said, to the individual business and product, and then obviously consider it in a context of the whole client relationship. I think as we look forward, CCAR is something to be thoughtful about, because it\u2019s a stress scenario, it\u2019s evolving in terms of the maturity of it, as well as a move over time towards being on a Basel III advanced approach. So if I had to guess, I would say CCAR could be.","Steven Chubak - Nomura ","And then transitioning to a risk-based ratio that\u2019s maybe not spoken about as often, the tier one capital ratio, that ultimately could compel increased preferred issuance. We did see you tap the market within the first six months of the year, and I didn\u2019t know how we should be thinking about the level of preferred issuance you\u2019re targeting going forward. Is it consistent with the 150 basis points noted within the Fed\u2019s proposal? Or should we be thinking about that differently, i.e. some of the mandated buffer will be met with incremental equity?","Marianne Lake ","I would say that our tier one capital needs to be at 11% plus. We said we were going to run at about 10% to 10.5% Basel III tier one common. I would suggest that the gap will be [unintelligible] and maybe more.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Marianne Lake ","Thank you, everyone.","Jamie Dimon","Thank you, talk to you in a quarter.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website, and please refer to the display regarding forward looking statements at the back of the presentation.","So turning to page 1, we carried strong momentum into the second quarter, with net income of $6.5 billion and an EPS of $1.60 a share, on revenue of $26 billion, up 13% year on year and flat versus the seasonally strong first quarter, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%.","And you can see on the page that we\u2019ve highlighted several significant items up front here: A $950 million reserve release in mortgage, and this quarter we saw net chargeoffs less than half of what they were a year ago; a $550 million reserve release in cards, with chargeoffs remaining historically low; and $600 million of expenses for additional litigation reserves in corporate. In addition, the results for the quarter included a $355 million DVA gain in the corporate and investment bank. ","Outside of these four items, we had a number of other small items, both positive and negative in the quarter, which offset each other, many of which I\u2019ll call out as we go through the presentation. And we want to be very transparent with you. We don\u2019t count items like reserve releases and other noncore items when we think about our own performance, so if we adjust for all of these items both big and small, our return on tangible common equity would have been about 15%, reflecting strong underlying core performance.","This quarter, a couple of important themes: The market\u2019s environment in June, as well as several capital developments. So just a quick note on each. Rising long term rates and higher levels of volatility in June had an impact both on the quarter as well as in terms of our mortgage outlook guidance. ","Our market businesses held up well in June, and our asset management platform outperformed during the backup. And importantly, remember that given the firm\u2019s positioning, rising rates will drive significant benefit in higher NII over time, but during the near term, higher long term rates and wider spreads drove a significant reduction in the unrealized gains in our securities portfolio, or a reduction in AOCI, which did impact Basel III capital negatively. ","Despite that impact, we were able to add to our capital and improve capital ratios as we began to realize some of the runoff and model benefits that we\u2019d previously guided you to. And finally, higher rates will have a significant impact on mortgage refi volumes and margins in the second half of the year. ","On capital, we\u2019ve added a new page in the deck on leverage, which I\u2019ll cover in a moment, but our headline capital number is a Basel III tier one common ratio of 9.3%, including the impact of the final Basel III capital rules approved this month by our regulators.","In general, the approvals are the same or similar to the NPRs, and in that sense, we\u2019re broadly in line with our expectations, including the confirmation of no exception to AOCI. The estimated impact on our ratio was a modest benefit.","So on page three let me take you through the details. We ended the quarter with Basel III tier one common of $148 billion, up from the prior quarter. We set a Basel III capital walk here on the page in the blue callout box, which steps you through each component of the change quarter on quarter.","Our Basel III tier one common ratio before the impact of final U.S. rules increased to 9.1% from 8.9%, even after the 20 basis point impact from the change in AOCI. This impact is offset by a $40 billion reduction in risk-weighted assets, reflecting the impact of portfolio runoff as well as lower levels of risk.","So then adding in the benefit of final rules, which were principally related to changes in MSR rules and securitization benefits, our ratio at the quarter end was estimated at 9.3%. And as you know, although we reflect our best understanding of all the rules in our ratio, we don\u2019t pull forward the impact of passive runoff or model enhancements, some of which we saw this quarter.","Together, these will deliver approximately an additional 75 basis points of benefits by the end of 2014. And we remain committed to reaching a 9.5% Basel III tier one common ratio by year-end.","Briefly on liquidity, in addition to building our capital, we accelerated compliance with the proposed Basel III liquidity coverage rules. And not only did we become compliant with the rule during the quarter, but at quarter end our estimated ratio was 118%, and we feel great about the progress we\u2019ve made. Although there can be short term volatility in the number, you should expect that we will run around this level going forward.","And to finish on page three, in the bullets, the board increased the quarterly dividend to $0.38 a share from the previous $0.30, and during the quarter we repurchased $1.2 billion of common equity, as a reminder, that $1.2 billion of the $6 billion CCAR authorization. ","So turning to page four, we\u2019ve added this page to help walk you through our current thoughts on the new proposals regarding Basel III leverage. Let me start with two things. We believe the leverage ratio is an appropriate complement to our tier one common ratio if properly calibrated, and our holding company leverage ratio is estimated at 4.7% at the end of the quarter, based upon the U.S. proposed rules. To be clear, these rules do not reflect the most recent Basel proposal which would further increase our leverage balance sheet.","Just a few comments on the proposal in the U.S.: the denominated bills on GAAP assets with add-ons for derivative potential future exposures and off-balance sheet commitments resulting in a gross up for us and approximately $1 billion. And remember, included on our balance sheet is over $450 billion of cash and other high-quality liquid assets, which we think there\u2019s a strong argument that they should not attract capital at these levels.","So I\u2019m going to take you through the analysis on the page. We started with analysts\u2019 estimates for net income, and we held our dividends flat and assumed repurchases generally consistent with our current levels. Given those assumptions, we would be able to add approximately 60 basis points to the leverage ratio by the end of 2014.","Additionally, we will continue to recalibrate our tier one capital through the issuance of preferreds. And finally, we will take appropriate actions to reduce our leverage assets, which may include some of the points on the slide. For example, repricing or restructuring our commitments or unwinding certain derivative positions.","And if you take those together, this could add another approximately 100 basis points over time, for a total of up to 160 basis points. So we will adjust our business, but we do expect the holding company to be able to be compliant in early 2015, with the bank to follow. Of course, a caution that this timeline could be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules, which are not yet final. ","Changing gears, let\u2019s turn to the business performance, starting on page five, with consumer and community banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $3.1 billion of net income for the quarter, on $12 billion of revenue, with an ROE of 27%. ","Just a quick look at the franchise. We ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches, over 19,000 ATMs, and we now have nearly 1,700 Chase private client locations. ","We continue to see really strong growth in the underlying drivers of the consumer businesses. Deposits were up over $40 billion year on year, an increase of 10%; customer attrition levels remain historically low; and our active mobile customer base grew by 32% year on year. So we\u2019re adding customers, we\u2019re retaining them through superior customer experience, and we\u2019re deepening our relationships with them. ","Also, mortgage and auto originations showed strong growth, up 12% and 17% year on year, respectively, and we had record credit card sales volume of $105 billion, up 10% year on year and record client investment assets of $172 billion, up 16%. ","Turning to page six, consumer and business banking, net income of close to $700 million, and an ROE of 25%, on net revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1% year on year and up 3% quarter on quarter. While we continue to see pressure on deposit margins, 5 basis points down in the quarter, this continues to be largely offset by very strong growth. And on the noninterest revenue side, we\u2019re seeing strong growth in both debit and investment revenue.","Expenses are up year on year, reflecting the investments we\u2019re making in the business, including branch builds, as well as the absence of some one-time items that benefited the prior year. ","During the quarter, we had record investment sales of $9.5 billion, up 53% year on year, and I\u2019ll note that approximately 70% of those sales are managed money, driving strong recurring revenue for the business, up 13% year on year. ","Average business banking loan balances are flat quarter on quarter, up 4% versus last year. And you can see here in the drivers that the loan production stabilized just above the very low levels we saw in the first quarter. We believe that we\u2019re maintaining share despite increased competition, and the pipeline is up relative to the first quarter, which should support origination levels in the second half of the year. ","Turning to page seven, and mortgage banking, overall mortgage banking net income was $1.1 billion, with an ROE of 23%. At the top of the table, looking at the first blue highlighted lines, production pretax income was $582 million. Top line production revenue, excluding repurchases, was up slightly quarter on quarter, with a higher reported gain on sale pretax margins of 116 basis points, more than offsetting lower closed loan volumes, down 7%.","$49 billion of mortgage production saw a change in mix this quarter as the purchase market continued to recover. Our purchase volumes increased over 40% quarter on quarter, and contributed 36% to volumes, up from 23% last quarter. And despite the strong start in April, the environment in late May and June drove mortgage rates up significantly, around 100 basis points.","This pressure continued into July, and we expect it could have a significant impact on the refinance market side in the second half of the year. So if mortgage rates stay at or above current levels, the market could be reduced by an estimated 30% to 40%. Although we will adjust capacity, expense reductions will lag volume reductions, and will challenge profitability and production. ","Moving down to servicing, pretax income of $133 million, up quarter on quarter and year on year, on lower expenses and modest gain in the MSR. Servicing expenses of $715 million decreased quarter over quarter in line with our expectations, and we continue to see servicing or expect servicing costs to decrease to $600 million by the fourth quarter.","At the bottom of the table, real estate portfolio pretax was $1.2 billion. Runoffs of the legacy portfolio continued, although in the quarter, given the positive economics of retaining certain loans, we added close to $5 billion of mortgage loans to our portfolio, which is up $1.3 billion quarter on quarter, and we expect to be able to sustain these levels in the second half.","On credit, delinquencies and foreclosure in our portfolio were each down around 10% quarter on quarter. Net chargeoffs continue to come down less than $300 million this quarter, which was in line with our guidance, and we released $950 million of reserves. The majority of this release related to to impact of lower severities, reflecting real and sustainable HDI improvements. Going forward, we expect quarterly net chargeoffs of less than $250 million, and as credit trends continue to improve, expect additional reserve releases in the next several quarters. ","Turning to car merchant services and auto, on page eight, net income of $1.2 billion, up 21% year on year, with an ROE of 32%, or 23% if you exclude reserve releases, reflecting excellent underlying performance in the business. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year on year, and despite strong volumes, down slightly quarter on quarter as a result of spread compression.","In cards, year on year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was both strong and consistent at 10% and 15% respectively. And importantly, we saw a stabilization of outstandings at the end of the second quarter, after 15 quarters of net runoff. And we believe we\u2019ve reached an inflection point and expect some modest growth from here.","Expenses are down year on year, primarily driven by lower remediation expenses on our legacy product. And the net chargeoff rate continues to be very low, and we released $550 million of credit card loan loss reserves this quarter. This reflected both the continued improvement in early stage roll rates as well as higher than expected levels of paydowns on modified loans.","The net chargeoff rate was 3.31%, down over 100 basis points year on year. And if we continue to see favorable roll rates, as well as our modified loans continuing to pay down, we will see incremental reserve releases in the second half of 2013. ","And before we move on, a few words on auto. Originations up 17% year on year, reflecting market share gains and driving loan balances up 5%.","Moving on to slides nine and 10, and the corporate investment bank, a strong second quarter performance, which included a DVA gain of $355 million. This was versus a gain in the same quarter of last year of $755 million, both of which are shown in the credit adjustments line. As usual, we\u2019ll focus on the numbers excluding DVA. $2.6 billion of net income was the highest second quarter net income since 2009, up 37% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter.","Revenue of $9.5 billion was up 16% year on year, and the business delivered an ROE of 19%. Total banking revenue of $3.1 billion, up 17% year on year, on higher IBCs of $1.7 billion, up 38%, primarily driven by strong debt and equity underwriting.","We continue to be bank number one year to date in IBCs, and despite weaker credit markets toward the end of the quarter, we had near record debt underwriting fees in the first half of 2013. And equity capital markets, we have the number-one wallet share for the first half of the year.","Moving on to markets revenue, which was up 18% year on year, in line with our guidance, a very strong performance, particularly given the challenging environment in June, reflecting strong client flows throughout the quarter, the diversification of the business, and trading risk discipline. ","Fixed income markets revenue of $4.1 billion was up 17% year on year, with credit and spread related products benefitting from less Euro Zone uncertainty and a stronger U.S. housing market. Equity markets of $1.3 billion was up 24% year on year, with strong client flows in [pass] and equity derivatives. ","And before we leave markets, just a quick update on OTC clearing. The implementation of phase II in June went very smoothly. Although volumes were relatively light at launch, we have seen activity pick up, and we feel we have the right level of participation.","Securities services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 1% year on year, and within this number you should note growth in custody fees is in line with asset growth, but is offset by declines in agent lending as well as lower volumes in clearance and capital management.","Just a comment on credit. Trends are stable at low levels, with small net recoveries for the quarter. Loans are down 6% quarter on quarter, driven by lower balances in trade and conduits, and expenses were up 8% year on year, driven primarily by higher comp on higher revenues, with a comp to revenue ratio, excluding DVA, of 31% for the quarter.","Finally on this page, at the bottom of the driver section you see CIB average VAR, which continued to decline to $40 million, reflecting generally lower levels of risk, but also lower volatility across asset classes. I\u2019ll note that the increased volatility in June did, however, drive spot VAR up higher, to over $60 million.","Before we skip over page 10, just a comment. If you take a look at the numbers for first half of 2013, you can see we continue to make great progress in the international space, and had particular strength in Asia during this quarter. ","Turning to page 11, commercial banking saw net income of $621 million on revenue of $1.7 billion, with an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 3% quarter on quarter, despite the softer lending environment, driven by higher average loan balances, stable spreads, and positive momentum on cross-sell and IBCs. ","Although end of period loans were flat this quarter, we saw very strong growth in commercial real estate, up 3% and gaining share, offset by lower corporate lending. Our clients have excess cash, and are keeping their utilization rates low, but we\u2019ve also seen the continuation of competitive pricing and aggressive structuring. We\u2019re holding the line and choosing quality over growth, and this of course is reflected in our strong credit performance. But we\u2019re still adding very good clients, and doing more business with existing clients. ","As we look forward, we expect continued strong growth in the real estate business, given our competitive position, and for C&I loans, pipelines are up from the first quarter and deal activity feels like it may be turning. We are expecting a more constructive second half, and therefore should see some growth, but the environment remains competitive.","Turning to page 12, and asset management, an excellent quarter, and despite challenging markets in June, we saw net income of $500 million, up 28% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter, with an ROE of 22%. ","$2.7 billion of revenue, up 15% year on year, reflects an increase in management fees, driven by strong long term net inflows, $25 billion this quarter, marking the 17th consecutive quarter of long term inflows, and higher equity and fixed income markets, up 12% based on our business mix. We also saw higher performance fees driven by strong fund returns, and record loan balances, up $16 billion year on year across products and geographies.","A moment on expenses. Growth and performance in the business led to 11% year over year expense growth, but as our investments season, the business is delivering positive operating leverage, which you can see in the pretax margin, which is 30%, up from 27% last year. ","We ended the quarter with assets under management of $1.5 trillion, up 9% year on year, and client assets of $2.2 trillion, up 10%, despite small net outflows in June. However, the breadth of our platform should enable us to continue to gather net new assets globally, looking forward, and we delivered strong relative performance in both fixed income and equities.","Moving on to page 13, and corporate and private equity, a net loss of $552 million for the quarter. Private equity generated net income of just over $200 million, which included over $400 million of gains in part driven by investments that are in active sales discussions. Treasury and CIO net loss was $429 million, driven by negative NII due to continued low rates and slower reinvestment, as well as a change in portfolio mix, shifting from higher yielding securities to [LTR] eligible securities and cash.","The result also included net securities gains and a modest loss on [unintelligible] redemption, which we guided to last quarter. Excluding the net of these two items, CIO Treasury would have been a net loss of about $350 million, which is generally in line with our guidance. And our quarterly guidance remains unchanged.","Finally, other corporate. A net loss of $335 million includes the $600 million of pretax expense for additional litigation reserves in the quarter. Excluding litigation, other corporate was around $100 million net income, in line with our guidance. And again, our guidance, which does include litigation and significant items, remains unchanged for other corporate.","Turning to page 14 and net interest margin, net interest income was down slightly and core NIM was down 23 basis points quarter on quarter. We acknowledge this is larger than you may have expected, but let me give you some color. Importantly, it was principally the result of actions we took to build liquidity to comply with Basel requirements more quickly, which we believe is a strong positive. And to the degree it was also a pull forward of compression we guided to over time.","So with that in the table on the slide, which shows our cash balances and how they progress over time, and what you can see circled is that our cash was up more than $100 billion quarter on quarter, with other interest earning assets being broadly flat. This changed the relative mix and also the size of our interest earning assets, and drove core NIM down the 18 basis points we circled on the page. ","While the increase in cash does reflect accelerated LTR compliance, it does also reflect very strong deposit growth and slower reinvestments, and a little less robust loan growth. The balance of the reduction in NIM relates to loan yield compression, partially offset by the lower cost of debt.","So going forward, all else being equal, what we expect from here is relatively stable NIM in the second half of the year and net interest income to increase modestly next quarter. So finally on slide 15, here\u2019s our outlook. I covered these items as we went through presentation, so in wrap up, overall a very strong quarter, returning 17% on tangible common equity with excellent underlying performance across businesses, while making significant progress on capital and liquidity ratios. And the firm overall is positioned to benefit from a higher rate environment.","Thank you for joining us. Operator, you can open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Do you have any sense that you could give us to where you stand on the leverage ratio at the bank level today relative to the 6% requirement?","Marianne Lake ","We don\u2019t disclose the bank leverage ratio, but it is lower than the holding company, so we would have a further way to go. We\u2019ve said we intend to be compliant at the holding company level by the beginning of 2015, and work on bank compliance shortly thereafter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Maybe within a quarter or two? Can you give us any feel there?","Marianne Lake ","Obviously the rules are fairly new, and still a proposal and not final, so there\u2019s work to do before they get finalized. We\u2019re working through all of the things we need to do to comply. I would say we would aim to be compliant by the end of 2015, but we need to go do more detailed plans, and we\u2019ll get back to you with more specifics.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Okay, and you mentioned the mitigation you can do at the holding company. Is there mitigation you can also do to help specifically the bank level ratio in terms of maybe assets that could be shifted to the parent, or equity that could go from the hold company to the sub and things like that?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, all of those things could be considered, and would be considered.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then on the liquidity ratio, why have you decided to run with this level of cushion to LTR, and why the acceleration in getting there now? Anything driving that in particular?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, so in terms of the cushion, while it\u2019s not scientific, there is a volatility in that number inherent in actual deposit flows. So we do see some things in deposit flow, particularly wholesale flows, and that could span a quarter end and drive the ratio up or down some. So it\u2019s prudent to run that ratio above 100%, and at around about this level. And just in terms of acceleration, we just wanted to get there more quickly. The opportunity presented itself, so nothing more than that.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Okay, and could you give us some of the assumptions behind your outlook for stable net interest margin and modest net interest income growth in the back half of the year, just in terms of maybe what you\u2019re assuming on rates and loan growth, and what are the puts and takes in your outlook?","Marianne Lake ","That\u2019s a great question, John, because as you alluded to in the question, there\u2019s a large number of moving parts in terms of the forecast, including points of view on rates, which as you know have been choppy over the last several weeks. So we base our projections on modest loan growth and on our understanding of the implied rate curves, and they could change. ","Also, deposit flows, as you\u2019ve seen, have been very, very strong. So we accelerated our LTR compliance back, the majority of the NIM compression we were previously expecting and guiding you to, forward, and consequently we expect to be more stable, with some loan yield compression being offset by lower cost of debt.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And finally, I\u2019m not sure if I saw it in here or not, but can you remind us how much you benefit from higher rates? And which rates in particular are most helpful for you? If you can delineate between kind of the 10-year and the shorter based rates?","Marianne Lake ","I\u2019ll just give you two data points and then you can maybe go and have a look at them. But I think in the Q we disclose a couple of things. The first is a bit of a [unintelligible], which says that over 12 months it would deliver about $900 million of additional NII. 10 year going up 100 basis points, I\u2019m sorry. And that\u2019s not exactly what we\u2019ve seen, but it\u2019s the closest thing to what we\u2019ve seen right now. ","And then the other thing we\u2019ve disclosed is on a parallel shift of 100 basis points. So if you saw short rates go up too, and that would deliver just over $2 billion over 12 months. And don\u2019t forget that recurs, but it takes time to build up to that. ","Jamie Dimon","And that\u2019s interest rates only, not mortgage volume, investment banking volume. That\u2019s just isolating interest rates only, assuming the company invests the way we\u2019re planning to.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then that\u2019s the current numbers? That\u2019s last Q, or that\u2019s as of right now?","Marianne Lake ","Those were the numbers from the last Q, and they are not meaningfully changed right now. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","On reserve release, how can we gauge, if it is possible at all, how long this can go on for? Are there any base metrics that you think you can\u2019t go below that we can kind of look at as a percentage of loans or a percentage of normalized chargeoffs? Any help you can give us to kind of gauge how much might be left on the reserve release front?","Marianne Lake ","I would point you to - and I can\u2019t remember the page, so I apologize - but we put a page in investor day that talked about what we thought through the cycle chargeoff rates were for each of our businesses, and so what I would do is take NCI loans and a reserve balance at the end of the period of $3.3 billion, take a look at that page and figure out what a more normal chargeoff rate and therefore reserve balance would be, and that will be in large part our reduction over the course of the next several quarters. So we expect it to be a journey to get to that level throughout 2014.","Jamie Dimon ","So wholesale, kind of where we should be, we shouldn\u2019t expect much different. Credit card, maybe a little bit more, but then the 100s of millions. And on mortgage, I think we said at investor day, eventually it will a billion to a billion and a half. [cross talk] couple of years. ","And KPI, if we have home improvement, we may see some reductions in [PCI] loan loss reserves, purchase credit reserve.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","You haven\u2019t done that yet in terms of taking the PCI out yet, right? ","Jamie Dimon ","No.","Marianne Lake ","We haven\u2019t done that yet, John, but the reserve release we\u2019ve got in NCI was driven in large part by lower severity, so it would just continue. You might see some of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","Another quick question on leverage. Could you help me understand why it takes until 1Q \u201915 for the bank holding company to add the 30 basis points necessary to the leverage ratio? It looks like what you laid out puts you kind of well above that earlier.","Marianne Lake ","What we laid on the page was an illustration. And you\u2019re absolutely right, what it shows you is that we ought to be able to close that gap much more quickly. And so that might very well be what happens. We just aren\u2019t going to come out now with a target of achieving it over the course of the next one or two quarters, because we have other objectives, including the continuation of being able to have some capital distribution to you guys that we want to be able to decide when we do CCAR at the end of the year.","Jamie Dimon ","We\u2019ll be able to do it pretty quickly when we know what it actually is. We don\u2019t want to start making actions that affect customers way in advance of knowing the real, final rules.","Marianne Lake ","But what you took away from the page is absolutely right. Closing that gap should not be difficult, and could be more quick than this, but we want to be cautious.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","Understood. And was there a change in the securities portfolio during the quarter? And maybe could you give us an update on where that duration stands? ","Marianne Lake ","We\u2019re not going to disclose the duration, but there was some changes in the portfolio as we moved out of noneligible into eligible securities for LTR and also maintain more cash. So there were some changes. We also [saw] making gains on sale, and we were doing that.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","","So would the bias be to assume that it would be towards shorter?","Jamie Dimon ","No.","Marianne Lake ","No.","Jamie Dimon ","When rates go up, certain mortgages lengthen, and a whole bunch of different things take place. But in general, the portfolio is several year duration, and a couple of year duration, AA-plus, and obviously it changes over time, so it manages shared exposures. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","And then just a quick follow up on John\u2019s question. Is it generally right, given what you guys have disclosed, and you guys just verified, and what we\u2019ve seen in rates, if we assume that rates kind of stay where they\u2019re at, that you would get about 75% of that $900 million in additional NII in 2014, if we kind of stay status quo to where we are now?","Marianne Lake ","That\u2019s not a bad assumption.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","And then last one, just trying to think about maybe the potential to avoid some of the really big distraction that we saw this quarter around what is sort of becoming an annual event at the shareholder vote. Have you guys considered maybe articulating some kind of plan or a blueprint, or a map or what have you, to get people comfortable with the future state of CEO\/Chairman roles way down the line when there is sort of a secession that is in place?","Jamie Dimon ","We\u2019re not going to say what board deliberations are, but the board obviously has talked about a bunch of ideas. Also, we think we have some of the best corporate governance out there, including what I think is more important than the separation of chairman and CEO, that the board should make decisions based on the circumstances at the time. They know the company, the strategy, the people. That the board always meets without the CEO, the board in total sets the agenda, the board is completely engaged in CEO compensation, the board can hire and fire the CEO at will. And those practices, some are in our charters, some are not, but hopefully it won\u2019t be the distraction it was last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","One more question on page four. Your 4.7 is really close. We were looking for 4.5, so very much in line with what we were looking for. I\u2019m just wondering why no bank sub disclosure. I realize that it\u2019s different. And I heard your answer earlier, but I\u2019m just wondering why not just give us a number? Is it that there\u2019s too much uncertainty in estimating that denominator? You need understanding from the regulators, what they\u2019re looking for. Could you just help us out on a little bit of the qualitative reasons?","Marianne Lake ","There\u2019s nothing [sinister] underlying it. Let me just give you hopefully enough. It is a little bit lower than 4.7, and given that the ratio for the bank holding company is 6%, then the gap is a little bit bigger. But measured in small tens of basis points, not more.","Jamie Dimon ","A lot of it\u2019s historical. JPMorgan Chase got built through mergers over time, [unintelligible] in the bank, [unintelligible] broker-dealers. We\u2019re going to have to change our legal entities a little bit overseas. So we\u2019ll just have to modify legal entities to accomplish our objectives, and we\u2019ll be able to do that over time.","Marianne Lake ","And over time, you know, [unintelligible] will help.","Jamie Dimon ","The only [unintelligible] constraint is the 5%.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Yeah, I get that. If possible, I\u2019d love to show you what our assumptions are, and maybe we could understand where we differ?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, of course.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then separately, you put on here, on this page, the potential further add-ons for the Basel proposal. You\u2019re talking about the Basel\u2019s consultative document that came out a couple of weeks ago. Is there any sense as to what kind of basis point hit that is?","Marianne Lake ","We\u2019re not going to disclose it today, and we can reconsider that. Because we think there are some pretty fundamental issues with some of those proposals, not least of which is the absence of [unintelligible] or [unintelligible] on [max] securities financing, which we believe and are hopeful is going to be resolved. But it is an add-on, and it\u2019s not insignificant.","Jamie Dimon ","One of the things I stress [is derivative] receivables and not taking benefit for collateral, which we know we get. So there are a lot of issues in there that need to be looked at and analyzed.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","As to Brennan\u2019s earlier question, I think in the context of what we laid out as [illustratively] being achievable, then timelines would solve the problem.","Jamie Dimon ","The other important point is one of the things that Basel and all this stuff is supposed to do is harmonize global rules. This is clearly no longer harmonization. We have one part of the world that\u2019s talking about two times what another part of the world is talking about. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any industry out there that would be comfortable with something like that in the long run. But in the long run, that has a lot of effects you can\u2019t determine quarter by quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And part of the challenge is a higher denominator on one side and a higher ratio on the other side, right?","Marianne Lake","Right.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Just on HPI, HPI obviously rose significantly in the quarter. Could you give us an indication as to how much that helped RWAs? Was that a big piece of the driver? ","Marianne Lake ","The HPI [unintelligible] on RWA has a bit of a lag to it. So while it did contribute to the reduction in our RWA, our reduction was principally runoff, and some model enhancement and some lower risk. But in part that lower risk was driven by better HPI.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","So can you give us a sense as to given where HPI is today, what kind of benefit that would have on RWAs, if there wasn\u2019t a lag?","Marianne Lake ","It\u2019s a great question, and we will get back to you after the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Just drilling down to some of the businesses here. Obviously June, as you had mentioned, we\u2019ve all seen it was very volatile in the credit markets and the fixed income markets in general, and I guess kind of a basic question. Like, how did you do so well in fixed income? I know you guys had commented early part of the month, but things have deteriorated quite a bit, and I think some of us were surprised at how good it was back in the quarter.","Marianne Lake ","June was a bit more challenging, and so it wasn\u2019t as strong as April and May, but it really comes down to the fact that we really do have a client-driven business model, and the client flows, they held up. And so if you surround that with robust and strong trading risk discipline, that\u2019s pretty much how it turned out.","Jamie Dimon ","I think our folks in emerging markets also did a spectacularly good job, because I think you might see some real differentiation there from some other folks when all their numbers come out. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And is that just from managing a smaller inventory while the spreads were widening?","Jamie Dimon ","A little of everything.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And I guess on the other side, when we look at the comp rate at the investment bank, it was down I think 2-3%, both linked quarter and year over year. What\u2019s driving that? Is it mix? Is it streamlining of the business lines that you announced about a year ago fully coming together? Or just paying people less?","Jamie Dimon ","I think we\u2019ve been very consistent how we look at comp and how we accrue it and things like that, after capital charges and by line of business, type of business. So it\u2019s just a change of mix and change of capital, etc.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And I think you\u2019ve been guiding toward 35%. So do you think that maybe it\u2019s the lower end of that? That this is more sustainable?","Jamie Dimon ","Possibly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","First, I just want to follow up on the comment. So, over the next 12 months, NII should benefit by 75% of the $900 million? In other words, in 2014 you should benefit by about $700 million?","Marianne Lake ","All other things being equal, that\u2019s not an unreasonable assumption. But as we said, all things are never equal.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","No, I understand. It\u2019s more art than science. So I guess your run rate of net interest income, that would be about 1.5% of that? Is that in the ballpark of how you think about it?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, I guess that\u2019s about right. Or maybe a little less. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And when you say the benefit, the benefit of the 10-year increasing 100 basis points? I didn\u2019t fully hear how you explained that.","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, I think we disclose all of the assumptions in the earnings [at risk] tables in the 10-Q, but yes, it\u2019s short rates staying low and the 10-year going up 100 basis points, I think.","Jamie Dimon ","Yes, that\u2019s what drags up the 5-year to 7 [unintelligible]. Because if you use 1 point, it\u2019s the 10-year, but it\u2019s the yield curve going up [unintelligible].","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","The reason I ask that is it seems as though maybe the 10-year\u2019s not as relevant as perhaps the 5-year, or am I mistaken? ","Marianne Lake ","You\u2019re not mistaken, which is why if you actually get more of a parallel shift and rates go up, numbers go up by multiples.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Separately, the investment banking backlogs, where are they versus the first quarter, at the end?","Marianne Lake ","The pipeline?","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Yeah.","Marianne Lake ","Activity levels picked up some, and we expect that to carry into the third quarter, so a little better.","Jamie Dimon ","You saw a real slowdown when we had the volatile markets in June, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually\u2026 You know, the market\u2019s kind of opening up again. You see a bunch of IPOs and [unintelligible] deals, and M&A chatter.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And the leverage ratio, you said under the U.S. rules it\u2019s 4.7%. Under the proposed Basel rules, if adopted, where would the leverage ratio be?","Marianne Lake ","We didn\u2019t disclose that, Mike, for a couple of reasons. One is that, as we said, the proposals, we think, have some fundamental issues to them. But it would be lower. The growth up to our balance sheet on top of the 3.5 sitting on the page would not be insignificant. But we didn\u2019t disclose it. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Can you give us a ballpark? Or is that one reason you\u2019re being so conservative? You have 160 basis point potential benefit, but you\u2019re still saying wait until early 2015. Is that part of your thought process?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, that is definitely one of the reasons, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we said and of course the timeline could be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules. And that would be one of those changes.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And then last question relates to the processing business, which to me looks like it\u2019s lagging for the second quarter in a row. And I\u2019m asking a more broad question, for eight years since BankOne merged with JPMorgan and I think for a few decades before that, it was run as a separate business, and the fourth quarter last year it was merged into the investment bank, and now we have two quarters in a row of what looks like performance that will lag peers. ","So my question is, how is the management and organizational restructuring going? Is it impacting the processing bus, or is there something else taking place there? ","Jamie Dimon ","I think it\u2019s going great, and the folks in the field will tell you that they\u2019re seeing huge benefits from putting together the corporate global investment bank, the corporate investment bank, treasury services. But you are right, there\u2019s been a flattening out a little bit in treasury services and investor services, which is mostly custody. Some of that\u2019s spread, some of that\u2019s margins. So some of that will benefit also a little bit from rising rates. But we don\u2019t what the peers will show yet. Maybe you do, but I don\u2019t know yet.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Yeah, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s going to lag. I mean, you have assets under custody down 2% linked quarter, when markets are up as much as they are. Is there anything else that\u2019s one-time or unique?","Jamie Dimon ","Mike, I don\u2019t know, and obviously if we lag our peers, we\u2019ll be as disappointed as you are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","My first question really has to do with some of the initial questions asked on capital. What is the priority here on capital distribution versus leverage ratio? Is it compliance to the 5% at the hold co? Or is it accelerating capital distribution over the next two years relative to what you announced out of this year\u2019s CCAR? Or can JPMorgan both be compliant with the leverage ratio over time and accelerate buybacks and dividends?","Jamie Dimon ","Your last one.","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, it\u2019s balancing both, Erika, which is why in response to the earlier question, we said we\u2019ve been conservative on the timeline because we want to preserve the flexibility to consider capital distributions when we do our CCAR in 2013, and it will be a factor we consider.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And a follow up question on what you mentioned, Marianne, in the beginning of the call, on mortgage. You mentioned that if rates stay where they are, that could mean the market shrinks by 30% or 40%. What is the proportion in expense in that scenario that you could take out of the business? And how long typically is the lag until you can take those expenses out?","Marianne Lake ","The truly variable, as in transaction variable, portion of the business is some, but the majority of it is related to people and systems. So there\u2019s usually a several-month lag to be able to get that out of the system.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And proportionately, if the revenues are down, let\u2019s say, origination revenues are down 30-40%, what\u2019s the efficiency ratio that we can think about as we think about the variable costs that can be taken out?","Marianne Lake ","Think about it this way, I think that revenue margins will be down on competitive pressures. Volumes are down, and expenses may go up, because volumes are down for a couple of quarters. Sorry, expense margins would go up.","Jamie Dimon ","In other words, a dramatic reduction in profits.","Marianne Lake ","Yeah, we\u2019re trying to be clear with you that this would be a significant event if mortgage rates stay where they are or go higher. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","I wanted to ask on expenses. Can you talk about how you\u2019re still feeling about the full year target? You had previously talked about down a billion year over year, ex-legal. Does that still stand?","Marianne Lake ","Let me just walk you through it. This quarter our expenses adjusted for litigation were $15.2 billion. For the first half, adjusted corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters was 30.7, which would be against the $59 billion target, which is running a little high, but there are two important factors. ","One is in our definition of adjustment, we only adjusted out corporate litigation, so there\u2019s other litigation in the firm. That\u2019s several hundred million dollars disclosed in our [unintelligible] and you can see that. And also, in the first half of the year, we did see outperformance in terms of the investment bank or CIB revenues, and clearly we pay compensation on that, which is a good expense, and we would waive it in all day long. ","So if you take the combination of those two things that we don\u2019t technically adjust out, our underlying core expenses are on track for that number, yes.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And the additional litigation costs this quarter, somewhat elevated. How do we think about them going forward? Staying elevated but similar rate? Or a little bit lower? How do we think about that?","Marianne Lake","You can\u2019t really think about a run rate trend in litigation costs, because they are somewhat lumpy. So we don\u2019t have a forecast for you and they will go up and down.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then in terms of the rates, obviously impact a lot of different businesses, mortgage, the balance sheet, NII, NIM discussion. And also, can you walk through how we should think about it in terms of the fixed business? Heightened volatility, maybe more volume, but then obviously softer environment in June. How do we think about this current environment kind of playing out for the back half of the year in terms of trading?","Jamie Dimon ","You\u2019re absolutely right. When you separate NIM you try to tease it out, and [you\u2019re making them] interest rate, because you\u2019ve got to look at the underlying results, underlying volumes, and things like that. There\u2019s no reason to think that we\u2019re not going to have a good trading going forward, because if the economy is strengthening, and our view is that it is, and that capital markets are going to kind of open up again, and people get adjusted to slightly higher new rates. And yeah, volatility helps certain trading areas. Higher [unintelligible] certain mortgages, they can help other areas. So it\u2019s a whole potpourri. It\u2019s impossible almost to separate it out. We try to do that for you, but I think it\u2019s a little bit of a mistake to look at the whole company.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then my last question was just a clarification on there\u2019s been a lot of regulatory issues, capital, liquidity, buffers on buffers, OLA, etc. I think it\u2019s this quarter that you\u2019re resubmitting your CCAR plan. Is it fair to assume that despite all these things that have been coming out, and still some hurdles need to be met, that one shouldn\u2019t expect the change in capital deployment? Or should we?","Marianne Lake ","We\u2019re working really hard on the CCAR resubmission, and you\u2019re right, we\u2019re going to resubmit that before the end of the third quarter. We\u2019re in constant dialog with the regulators, although we won\u2019t receive any formal feedback until we\u2019re in the fourth quarter. And so we\u2019re doing everything we can to be able to be successful in remediating any of the issues they identify for us. And if we\u2019re able to do that, then there should be no impact.","Jamie Dimon ","It won\u2019t be for lack of trying. You have a thousand people now who are devoted\u2026","Marianne Lake","We have 500 people that are dedicated, and thousands of people working on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","First of all, you mentioned servicing costs in the mortgage business being down by about $600 million in the fourth quarter. Is that largely coming out of the default side of things? Or do you think that will be more evenly spread between default and more regular servicing?","Marianne Lake ","Just a point of clarification if it wasn\u2019t clear. Our guidance was that we\u2019re expecting to get our expenses down to $600 million in the fourth quarter from the level that they\u2019re at now which is $715 million for this quarter. So to be very clear. And to remind you, our longer term on rates for that business is $325 million a quarter. So it is dominated by the default side, but there is some core performance obviously in there too.","Jamie Dimon ","And just to keep it really simple, we hope to get it to a run rate of $500 million the year after that, $400 million the year after that, and $325 million, where we should be. And we have a lot of work to do in systems, etc. to get all that done. And obviously the costly foreclosure, delinquent stuff is also coming down.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","So it\u2019s about a three to four year run rate to get down to ultimately where you want to be?","Jamie Dimon ","Three years.","Marianne Lake ","Three years, and know that we\u2019re actively working the portfolio to be able to do what we can more quickly. So you would expect that we\u2019re looking at either sales or subservicing in defaulted loans, and [capacitizing] our performing servicing. So we\u2019re working on all of that.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Just a further clarification question on gain on sale margins. You mentioned those were 118 basis points this quarter. You mentioned last quarter that they were 100 basis points and about 180 basis points on a normalized basis in the fourth quarter. Are all those calculated in the same way? Are those quarterly averages? Or are those the gains at the end of the quarter?","Marianne Lake ","They\u2019re all calculated the same way, based upon the disclosed closed owned volumes that we have to use. So if you take the revenues and expenses and use the closed loan volume for the quarter, that\u2019s how we drive the margins, which is why you see some short term noise quarter over quarter and the increases to actually 116 basis points, because we actually got revenues when we lock loans, but we report them closed.","Jamie Dimon ","Which is different than you guys do at Wells.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Fair enough. And then one final question. You mentioned deal activity appears to be turning. I think that was with respect to the commercial banking business. Could you provide a little more color on that? Did June\u2019s volatility in the interest rate scenario slow down business activity in the commercial banking business? And I\u2019m not really specifically talking about the investment bank, but more on the commercial banking side of things.","Marianne Lake ","I will tell you that it\u2019s more of what we\u2019re seeing and feeling in discussions and activity with our clients, that we feel like deal activity levels have picked up and may be turning. And the pipeline feels a little better, and solid, but not strong. So we\u2019re expecting that to translate into the second half and obviously as the economy continues to recover and confidence continues to grow, hopefully that will get even better.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And just finally, there\u2019s been a lot of talk, obviously, in the last couple of days, about a potential reassertion of Glass Steagall. And I guess I\u2019m just curious, given your current business model, if that were to come to pass, would that be a meaningful negative in terms of your ability to maintain your cross-sell opportunities across the businesses? Or is that perhaps less of a challenge given how you currently have the businesses structured?","Marianne Lake ","My comment on that is that Glass Steagall didn\u2019t have anything to do with the crisis, and our business model allowed us to be a port in the storm. Our customers like doing business with us in the model that we have now, so we don\u2019t spend time thinking about it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","I just want to be clear, when you talk about, on page four, that you\u2019re going to hold your capital distributions flat, is that for all of 2014 relative to \u201913?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, just to be really clear, and you look at the title there, to be clear, illustrative. We just, for the purposes of this analysis, we just held everything flat. That\u2019s not to imply anything about what our capital distributions will be going forward, but rather to imply we can continue to do some.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And then second, you put in here the tier one capital actions could add possibly 30 basis points. Could you give some color behind what you\u2019re thinking there?","Marianne Lake ","It\u2019s just optimizing our mix between common and preferred.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And with the total leverage impact of 60 to 160 basis points, clearly that\u2019s over the 5%. I assume, then, that you\u2019re going to be comfortable running something north of 5% when you finally get there?","Marianne Lake ","It\u2019s too early for us to talk about [unintelligible] on that level.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","In your investor day, you gave us the ROEs for the different lines of business and then, in the total firm, you fell 15-16%, 16% was your target ROE. Will that change now that you\u2019ve got to carry the higher leverage numbers?","Jamie Dimon ","This just came out, so we\u2019re trying to share information with you, and it might, but give us a little bit time and we\u2019ll give you a deeper feel how this might affect different businesses, different products. Because obviously when you do something like this, this will be pushed down, at one point, not just to the line of business, but to the client, and the product, and the country. And then we can answer that question for you.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","You guys have had some great C&I loan growth in the middle market space over the last four, five, six quarters. It seems like it\u2019s really slowed down this quarter. Anything in particular happen?","Marianne Lake ","Nothing in particular. Just demand. And I should tender that with demand and the continuation that we talked about of very, very strong competition. And we are, as I said, prioritizing quality over growth. We would tactically underperform rather than chase a deal we were uncomfortable with.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And finally, can you give us any color on how the shared national credit exam has gone? And are those results in your second quarter results? Or will they be in third quarter results?","Marianne Lake ","The results are in our second quarter results.","Jamie Dimon ","Not that material. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","Just a couple of quick follow ups. I hate to focus on the leverage ratio, but just one question on the cash component. I think by my calculation if you were to exclude cash from the denominator, that would add almost 70 basis points to your leverage ratio. Do you think that has any legs, or any sticking with regulators in terms of logic around excluding that?","Jamie Dimon ","You\u2019ve got to ask them.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","And then maybe just getting to the [unintelligible] business, you alluded to it a little bit. Some businesses benefit from volatility. Is it fair to assume that in June we saw things like foreign exchange and interest ratings do better, and credit and mortgages do worse? Is that the best way to think about it?","Jamie Dimon ","We\u2019re not going to give you monthly specific\u2026 I think our folks did a very good job in June. Obviously when spreads widen out, certain businesses are more at risk than others. I already mentioned that in emerging markets we probably saw the most volatility, both in terms of spread volatility and equity [unintelligible] did a very good job.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets "," ","On your reserve ratios, rate around 2%, and you had a lot of reserve releases in the quarter, with credit improving, can you continue to do this type of releases in the next couple of quarters, or is that reserve ratio going to stick around 2%?","Marianne Lake ","If you think about mortgages having some [more releases] because we continue to see delinquencies and severities improve, particularly HPI improvement. And so you should expect that to continue, maybe not at the level that we saw this quarter, because we had a big revision to HPI, as you know, during the last several months. And in card, we\u2019ve had a billion fifty of reserve releases in the first half. Given what we\u2019re seeing, we expect more releases in the second half, but not at that level.","Jamie Dimon ","Think of it as several hundred million. It\u2019s near the end, for card. And home sale is kind of where it should be, and we\u2019ll bounce around.","Operator","Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Just looking at the hit to the OCI at $3.1 billion, it actually seems like it\u2019s less than would have been implied by the guidance that you gave at the investor day. Obviously that was for a more severe shock, but just calibrating it relative to the number of basis points that the 10-year went up, etc. Any comment on that?","Jamie Dimon ","You\u2019ve got it exactly right. At investor day we gave you something far more dramatic than 100 basis points. And we\u2019ve already said the duration of this thing is not 10 years, it\u2019s a lot less than 10 years. So obviously the effect will be less.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And is part of the reason why, besides the fact that it was 100 basis points, not a 230 basis point move or whatever, is part of the reason linked to the derisking of the treasury portfolio that you were talking about as you prepared for the LCR?","Jamie Dimon ","Not really.","Marianne Lake ","Not really.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Okay. But is there validity to the idea that if we recalibrated for 100 basis points move versus a 230 basis points move that I think is implicit in that $15 billion number that you gave us in February, was the $3 billion in line with that? Or was it actually materially better? And if so, maybe if it wasn\u2019t related to the LCR derisking, why did you have a better outcome?","Marianne Lake ","The investor day scenario was a more severe scenario than the 230 basis points you\u2019re implying.","Jamie Dimon ","What number did we give at investor day?","Marianne Lake ","It was 300, plus or minus. And this is in line with our expectations.","Jamie Dimon ","Unfortunately, the OCI, I hate to say, is not that big a deal. We all know about it, we\u2019re all prepared for it. Rates can go up, OCI gains are going to down. There are 20 basis points, you\u2019re going to see this happen elsewhere. It\u2019s asynchronous. You know, we have OCI going to capital, and the benefits going to earnings in the future. ","So if it were up to us, we wouldn\u2019t have actually had this asynchronous [unintelligible]. And we\u2019re prepared, we\u2019re going to have buffers that can repair that. We know how the conservation buffer works, but it\u2019s not that big a deal. And the duration of our portfolio, and you guys could do it yourself, AA-plus, couple year duration, you could almost calculate those numbers yourself, with one caveat. The losses are less as rates go up, because of the [unintelligible] of the portfolio, currently. ","And the other thing about this, you can change it overnight at any time.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Fair enough. As I think about the changes that you can make to the business that you referred to on page four to mitigate the impact of the leverage ratio changes, you talk about optimizing the use of central clearing, and yet there\u2019s also all these concerns about the disallowance of additional derivatives collateral. How comfortable are you that the way the rules are written right now, moving your derivatives business more towards central clearing really does, because of the collateral, give you a lot of relief on those leveraged assets?","Jamie Dimon ","If you move a trade from central clearing house, it has no charge here, and it has nothing to do with the margin that they put up at the clearing house. If the trade is bilateral with cost, you have the receivable gets [unintelligible], you can\u2019t take benefit from the fact that you\u2019re going to get collateral against it. That\u2019s the way the calculations are done. So any trade you move to a clearing house eliminates that exposure. The margin for the clients at the clearing house is not with us, it\u2019s with the clearing house. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Right. So I guess the logical next question for that is given the central clearing mandate, which has started to be implemented recently, as we think about leverage ratio going forward, should we be thinking about a large part of that derivatives add in to the denominator of the ratio as basically being in runoff?","Jamie Dimon ","You know, we had already added in our forecast to you guys some stuff moved to derivatives, how to look at capital. So I do think at the margin this will [unintelligible] things at the clearing houses, but we don\u2019t have an analysis to tell you about that right now. Will it be material? We don\u2019t really know yet. Remember, a lot of the client business, they are also going to determine what they want. It won\u2019t be just up to us.","Marianne Lake ","And remember, that derivative add-on calculation is a calculation that is currently being rethought by the Basel committee, because of some of the issues with it. So it could also, in and of itself, improve.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","When you think about those leverage asset actions you\u2019re talking about, is there any linkage of taking those actions that further benefits LTR?","Marianne Lake ","We haven\u2019t done that analysis.","Jamie Dimon ","It\u2019s hard to tell.","Marianne Lake ","I mean, to be honest, we were trying to be very transparent and give you some ideas about the sorts of things that we\u2019re considering. We haven\u2019t translated these into detailed plans yet. So we don\u2019t know the second order impact of this yet. ","Jamie Dimon ","I think Marianne gave numbers that showed that we could handle this, but also, you have to be very cognizant of [fine] effects. We have a client business, and we have to make sure that we continue to have a client franchise, and so over time, we\u2019ll adjust the businesses and we\u2019ll meet LTR, we\u2019ll meet Basel III, we\u2019ll meet whatever the leverage ratio is. And think of it in some ways as alternative minimum taxes. So for every client we\u2019ll be running what\u2019s the return on Basel III capital? And then what\u2019s your return on leveraged capital?","Marianne Lake ","And stress capital.","Jamie Dimon ","And so you try to manage all those as fair to the client and kind of fair to the company.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","As I\u2019ve talked with clients over the last couple of days about this leverage ratio issue, one of the questions that has come up is wouldn\u2019t it be possible to downstream more capital to the banks in order to deal with the 6% requirement there? Obviously that incurs a double leverage issue, potentially. Your double leverage ratio right now is just over 1.05. Is there any room there?","Jamie Dimon ","Obviously there will be stuff like that. Give us a little time. I mean, we\u2019re showing you that we can get to the consolidated pretty easily. Maybe we have to restructure some things and change the capital structure a little bit, move businesses out of the FDIC insured bank and all that. I don\u2019t think any of that\u2019s going to be critical to the future function of our business. We\u2019ll adjust those things to accomplish what we need to accomplish. Give us a little more time. This just came out a couple of days ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ","It just seems the thrust of the whole leverage ratio is that it\u2019s going to penalize the businesses that have the highest ratio of leveraged ratio assets to risk weighted assets. And can you give us an idea where that gap is the biggest? And in particular, also, are any of these global businesses where this would give European banks a leg up?","Jamie Dimon ","Let me do the second question first. If you have a world where some businesses have to have twice as much capital as other companies, that obviously over time can create huge competitive disadvantages. I don\u2019t know of any industry in America who would want to compete globally on that basis. We have an interest in a safe and sound system, so we\u2019re not against the leverage ratio, but we\u2019re not for a hugely unbalanced competitive playing field. ","So put that aside. The regulators know that. We thought [unintelligible] Basel and all that to kind of harmonize these kind of things. And as you asked about, we show here, anything which is a low RWA asset, including HQLA, revolvers, certain types of derivatives, those things obviously you\u2019ll look at a little bit differently, because of this leverage ratio asset. And we don\u2019t have to do it by business yet. We\u2019ll give you more detail later. ","Like, even Marianne had mentioned that we take huge deposits in from countries, and from money funds, etc., that you may not take in because you can\u2019t afford capital against a deposit of a billion dollars that you\u2019re getting from a money fund, that you park at the Fed for 25 days, just waiting to pay the FDIC 10 basis points. You pay the client 5 or 6 or 7 basis points. You\u2019ve got to put 6% capital against it. A whole bunch of things we\u2019ve got to figure out how we\u2019re going to do it, but we want to make sure we manage the client franchise properly. We\u2019ll figure out the other stuff over time. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","Jamie, following up on that, it just seems like even the $100 billion of increase in deposits this quarter probably cost you 15 basis points in that leverage ratio. And so is there any movement, do you think, during the comment period, towards exclusion of any of the risk-free assets at all?","Jamie Dimon ","Separate the type of deposit, okay? So if it\u2019s a consumer deposit, it has a completely different LTR, how you can invest, the kind of spread you can make. If it\u2019s what we would call, like, big wholesale short term deposits, you\u2019re absolutely correct. We would probably restrict some of that over time.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","And maybe just to follow up on the mortgage business, you talked about some of the financial impacts. Can we talk a little bit just about strategically what you\u2019re doing as you kind of look at that business and the competitive environment in a kind of weaker refi environment?","Marianne Lake ","This back up, although sharp, is not entirely unexpected. So every thought about our longer term plans, and when we outlined all of that in the strategy for the mortgage business at investor day, that medium to long term plan does not change. So it may accelerate some of the activities that we have, and have, as we said, some impact on our next couple of quarters results, but the long term strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re working the portfolio, optimizing services, trying to take cost out as quickly as possible and grow share. And actually we should be able to grow share even more strongly in a more difficult market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research ","Two questions. First, on the branch banking network, I know this back up in rates has been primarily at the longer end, and we have not yet had a corresponding rise in short term rates. But do you see any needs at this point to reprice products, etc., at the branch level due to consumer perspective of rising rates? ","Marianne Lake ","No. Not yet. And as you know, traditionally that would, in any case, lag. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean it will, but that\u2019s traditionally what happens.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research ","Secondly, Jamie, you talked about the asynchronous nature of OCI with OCI getting dinged now with the benefits in the future. Something else asynchronous is sort of staring us in the face, and that\u2019s this loan loss reserve methodology possible change to expected lifetime loss. What are your thoughts about that? Where does that stand in an implementation process, and would you really get dinged by that?","Jamie Dimon ","This is what the issue is with all this. You spend all this time talking about accounting as opposed to business. The business is deposits, serving clients, doing things, and now we\u2019re talking all of a sudden about AOCI. And we have a lot of asynchronous accounting. And pro-cyclical accounting and stuff like that. We try to explain, but we try to look through all of that and build a business. More clients, more bankers, more branches, happier clients, and so all of our business, that\u2019s how we look at it. We\u2019ll work through the asynchronous accounting. ","If the loan loss reserve accounting changes, it would add obviously the loan losses, though probably not as much as people think. But we still would run the business for economics in the long run. It wouldn\u2019t change how we run the business, we\u2019d just be holding more reserves, which would be fine with us.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research ","I realize that you\u2019re going to run the business for the business, but do you have any sense if this is going to happen, and when it might happen?","Marianne Lake ","I mean, as you know, the industry commented, we commented, in terms of the proposal, and we\u2019re generally in favor of it. We think a lifetime timeline is too long. Something shorter would make more sense. I think we need to work that through. It would be implemented over, you know, not the course of the next couple of quarters, but in a year or so. So we\u2019ll wait and see.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Whalen of Carrington. ","Chris Whalen - Carrington ","Marianne, could you go back to mortgage and talk a little bit about the quality of the demand you\u2019re seeing? At the beginning of the year, the industry was guiding down about 20% in terms of volumes, and for next year as well. Your numbers suggest that\u2019s basically doubled. In other words, instead of 20% we\u2019re looking at 30-40% given rates. Would it be fair to say that the two factors are equal?","Marianne Lake ","First of all, the industry groups haven\u2019t fully reforecast the market, so we\u2019ll wait and see what they come out with. We\u2019re trying to be transparent with our guidance at that level. Hopefully we\u2019re wrong, and hopefully it will be better than that. I will say for our own business, we didn\u2019t expect volumes to be down this much throughout the year, had this not happened with this space.","Chris Whalen - Carrington ","So you think there is definitely a price reaction out there among consumers?","Jamie Dimon ","Well, mostly this is refi. So purchase we actually saw go up a little bit. ","Chris Whalen - Carrington ","But purchases are catching up, though.","Jamie Dimon ","They\u2019re not going to make up for refi, but they may go up, yes.","Chris Whalen - Carrington ","So Jamie, back to your point about harmonization, when you look at the totality of the way the regulators are treating mortgage, MSRs, for example, which have been rallying very strongly in the past few months, and your comments last year about Basel, should the U.S. withdraw from Basel II? I mean, it\u2019s so unfriendly to businesses that are very important to you and to the economy, particularly in mortgage. What are your thoughts on that?","Jamie Dimon ","We\u2019re in favor of finishing. We\u2019ve always believed in high capital, high liquidity, good regulation, things like that, and finishing it. Obviously, there are things that all companies have points of view about which would be different, but I think the closer you get to real harmonization, the better. And if you want to start all over again, we\u2019ll spend another five years debating every single thing out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. "," ","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Marianne, can we just go back to the sequential NII guidance? Can you help me understand how much of that is coming or what the attribution is between benefit to NIM versus loan growth?","Marianne Lake ","As I said, we\u2019re expecting NIM to stay broadly flat from here. We do expect some modest loan growth, our outlook. I\u2019m not going to tell you how much, but some. And then we also have the improving cost of debt, lower cost of debt, on actions that we\u2019ve been taking throughout the first half.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Shouldn\u2019t presumably, then, the benefits to the funding cost show up through NIM?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, but we also have yield compression, so there\u2019s puts and takes. So relatively flat on NIM, modestly up on NII.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","And then just within the composition of loan growth, if you divorce out the credit card seasonality, it\u2019s been within a very stable range. What is it that, in your view, takes the loans out of the current range?","Marianne Lake ","I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","In other words, your loan balances have been between $725 billion and $728 billion, very consistently, for many quarters, if you divorce out fourth quarter credit card seasonality. But it sounds like you have some expectation that starts to move out of that range in order to generate this improvement in NII. I was wondering what the driver of that is.","Marianne Lake ","We\u2019re growing loans in asset management, we\u2019re growing loans in auto, we\u2019re adding more mortgage loans, we\u2019re expecting some growth in commercial. Our commercial real estate is already growing strongly. We\u2019re expecting some growth in middle market and corporate client banking space. Although, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in CID, we\u2019re expecting that to remain relatively flat. So all other things being equal, that\u2019s net growth. And card, as I said, has hit that inflection point. So that will stop contributing to runoff, net.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","And then just finally, on the third quarter guidance, is that consistent with or relatively better than your prior annual guidance of down 1%?","Marianne Lake ","So, our annual guidance, if you look at the first half of the year, you\u2019ll see that obviously already we are down year to date by more than that amount. So this is relative to the third quarter we expect NII to go up. We\u2019re already down a little more than 1%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca.","Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca","On equity capital markets, clearly the volumes are up about 2% quarter on quarter, and I think we all expected you to outperform. But it was an extremely good performance, and I wondered if you could brag a little bit about how you achieved that and how much you thought was the market share and how much is down to geographic split. That\u2019s the first question. ","The second still I go back onto leverage. I\u2019m just intrigued by the comments on page four, which you touched on in an earlier question, on the tier one capital actions, which you sort of suggested would be perhaps issuance of some additional tier one capital. This is becoming called now AT1. ","And I wondered if you actually had any indication yet - and I know it\u2019s very early - from the regulator or what the terms of that new capital would have to be to qualify for tier one under Basel III. And then perhaps talk about the $14-15 billion of current hybrids that you have within the tier one calculation, which obviously you\u2019re going to phase out, I think, in some cases, if not all, through to end of 2018, and what your strategy is for replacing those. ","And then just perhaps finally, I know Jamie\u2019s talked a lot about level playing fields, and I\u2019ve asked him that last year on Basel III capital, but I\u2019m just wondering actually the leverage ratio that you\u2019re looking to have to achieve now, whether it actually gives you a competitive advantage as opposed to a disadvantage given 3% is pretty well considered too skinny.","Jamie Dimon ","Well, thank you for bragging on our trading results. For years, the investment bank is building FX rates, securitized products, commodities, emerging markets, credit, and they\u2019re good. And obviously some go up and some go down. ","I didn\u2019t see any regional effects. We trade around the world, and the books get handed off around the world, so it\u2019s hard to give it a region. But we build a lot of clients low businesses, and that was driving it. I think it\u2019s better for the world to have harmonized rules around what Basel\u2019s trying to do, etc., but you\u2019re absolutely correct, it doesn\u2019t have to be exactly the same to have a competitive marketplace, etc. ","We always ran with higher capital liquidity than most of our competitors. I just think if one is 3% and one is 6%, that becomes just too big. And over time, you could have huge competitive effects. And the regulators are working out\u2026 We all want a fair, safe, sound financial system. That\u2019s in everyone\u2019s benefit, and there are huge capital requirements, liquidity requirements, leverage requirements, stress testing requirements, and among all of that, I think we\u2019re getting there. But at one point, it should be somewhat harmonized. And your middle two questions I now forgot.","Marianne Lake ","Can we get back to you on some of that? We\u2019re running out of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton.","David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton ","To be clear, on page four, are you saying that your 4.7% leverage ratio is as of June 30 without any other assumptions or roll forward?","Marianne Lake ","Yes, correct. Sorry, as of June 30 based on the U.S. proposed rules.","Jamie Dimon ","Estimated to the best of our ability.  ","David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton ","And congratulations for doing the work so quickly. But secondly, Jamie, how will you as a company respond to the proposal? Are you in favor of it largely? Are you against it? Will you have a lot of proposed changes to it?","Marianne Lake ","We did say at the beginning that we do think that having a leverage ratio is an important part of our capital management toolkit or process, as long as it\u2019s properly calibrated. And so for us the two questions, and I think they\u2019re very important, and the industry does to, so we are participating in the discussions is, as Jamie\u2019s talked about, what should the quotient, or the ratio be, and making sure that that\u2019s not only appropriate but fair across the globe. And also, what should the calculation for the denominator be? ","And we\u2019ve alluded already to specific questions, but there are more. One is should high quality liquid assets, and most particularly cash and cash at central banks, be treated the same as other balance sheet items? And then in terms of some of the additional add-ons that are being proposed, we think they could have issued actual issues for the operation of the financing market. ","So I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of work that takes place. There are comments due back on all of those proposals by mid-September call it, plus or minus. And I think this will all be worked through the fourth quarter."],"12371":["JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our Web site. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.","Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $5.4 billion, EPS of $1.32, and a return on tangible common equity of 11%, on $23.7 billion of revenue. Included in the result is legal expense of $400 million after tax for a range of matters and we continue to put some issues behind us. This is reflected in a reduction of more than $1 billion to our reasonably possible loss estimate this quarter.","In addition, we recognized the benefit of a settlement reached of $300 million after tax which related to moneys owed to Washington Mutual in connection with a failed savings and loan institution. We've shown these on the page as legal related and the benefits recorded in revenue in Corporate.","Much like we saw in the third quarter, the overall company's performance benefited from diversification across our businesses. We saw strong growth in consumer drivers, on the back of improvement in the U.S. economy in large part generating core loan growth of 16% for the company. Global markets remained challenged across a number of fronts leading to lower client activity and lower inventory. Against this backdrop the CIB delivered solid performance across products. And in the quarter, we continued our trend of strong balance sheet, capital and expense discipline and exceeded targets.","Shifting to the full year's results, if you skip over Page 2, on Page 3, the firm earned record net income of $24.4 billion and record EPS of $6 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97 billion. Revenue was down 1% or $1.3 billion driven by non-core items, most notably by business simplification in the investment bank and also in private equity. Adjusted, our underlying businesses were up modestly.","We're very happy with our expense story for the year. We delivered adjusted expense of $56 billion, down $2.4 billion and a 2 percentage point decrease in adjusted overhead ratio. And while we did have a modest benefit from the strengthening dollar this year, we also self-funded incremental investments. Credit performance was strong, in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs at $4.1 billion. With obviously the biggest area of stress in wholesale being oil and gas, against, which we built about $550 million in reserves this year including $124 million this quarter.","And as the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional reserve build in 2016 but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant. We also built $68 million of reserves in metals and mining including $35 million this quarter. We're watching the sector closely and similarly if commodity prices remain at current levels, we would expect some additional reserve build but would not expect them to be significant.","Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $11 billion including dividends of $1.72 a share.","Turning to Page 4. Starting on the top left, overall our average balance sheet is down $100 billion year-on-year and our spot balance sheet down over $200 billion with of course the biggest driver being the reduction of approximately $200 billion of wholesale non-operating deposits ultimately reflected in lower cash balances.","In addition, you can see notable reductions in all other balance sheet categories except for loans which reflects the 16% core loan growth we achieved. Some portion of the other wholesale balance reductions were purposeful and will be sticky, particularly the decrease in short-term wholesale funding balances. The remainder resulted from volatile markets and general deleveraging driving risk of and lower inventory across products. As client demand for leverage grows we will likely put some of that balance sheet back to work.","Moving to the right. The story on deposits continues to be a very positive one as we delivered some incremental reductions in non-operating balances, while consistently growing retail and operating deposits. On the bottom left, overall, NII was up about $300 million driving a 7 basis point improvement in NIM. The increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans but also includes gains on certain securities and the impact of the rate move in December on this quarter's NII was not significant.","Looking forward to the first quarter, expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly on higher rates and mix, substantially offset by the absence of those security gains as well as normal seasonal day count. However, for the full year, with the December rate hike alone so in a rate flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII. Perhaps the highlight of this page on the bottom right is that based upon the actions we've taken throughout the course of 2015, we believe that we have just reached the 3.5% Method 2 G-SIB bucket and that we are in or close to the 2% Method 1 G-SIB bucket. So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day.","Turning to Page 5. We're ending the year well ahead of our capital targets with the firm's advanced fully phased in CET1 ratio at 11.6% and our standardized fully phased in ratio at 11.7%. The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction in risk weighted assets. With net loan growth being more than offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives, as well as secured financing balances. And these deliver a more meaningful reduction under the standardized approach. But with reference to my earlier comments on redeploying balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future.","Firm and bank SLR were at 6.5% and 6.6% respectively. Finally, we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter including $1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share.","Let's turn to Page 6 and consumer and community banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income on revenue of $11.2 billion and an ROE of 18% for the quarter. And full year expense was down by nearly $1 billion or half of our commitment if you adjust for legal and $150 million of incremental investments this year.","Going forward, we will look for opportunities to further reinvest. You can see headcount was down by 12,000 for the year and nearly 43,000 since 2012. The fundamental business drivers remain strong. Year-over-year, average loans were up 11% with core loans up 25% driven by mortgage but with strength across products. Average deposits were up 10%. We added nearly 600,000 households and our active mobile customer base continues to grow, up 20% to roughly 23 million customers, the largest of the major U.S. banks.","Moving to Page 7. Consumer and Business Banking. CBB generated strong results for the quarter with net income of $968 million and an ROE of 32% on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion. Although NII was flat quarter-on-quarter, it was down 5% year-on-year on spread compression, largely offset by that 10% deposit growth. And excluding an $85 million gain on the sale of a branch, non-interest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher service fees and strong debit volume. We expect NII to show normal seasonal declines in the first quarter.","Expenses was down 3% year-on-year on lower headcount from branch efficiency and additionally client assets were up 2% and Business Banking average loan balances up 6%.","Next Mortgage Banking on Page 8. Overall net income was $266 million, originations in the quarter were $23 billion, down seasonally and we continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, $16 billion for the quarter and totaling $70 billion for the full year. Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially on strong loan growth as well as on higher MSR risk management. For the full year, our non-interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion brought in line with our guidance and that downward trend will continue. As servicing balances continue to decline and as we expect production margins will compress in the smaller market. We expect the decline in 2016 to be around $700 million.","Expense of $1.2 billion ticked up this quarter related to exiting the OCC's consent order but it was down 10% year-on-year as we continued to manage costs. Finally on credit, net charge-offs of 13 basis points reflects the quality of our portfolio.","Moving on to Page 9. Card, commercial solutions and auto. Overall net income of $1.2 billion and an ROE of 24%. Revenue was $5 billion, up 10% year-on-year driven principally by two non-recurring items. The first was a loss in the prior year of over $200 million that related to non-core portfolio exits and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160 million on the IPO of square.","Adjusted the revenue rate was 11.9%. And in terms of core performance, business drivers were strong and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals on non-interest revenues while driving growth in NII. Year-over-year, we saw growth of 12% in auto, loan and lease balances, 6% in card sales volumes, 3% in cards core loans as well as 12% and 14% in merchant processing volumes and transactions respectively. Expense of $2.2 billion flat quarter-on-quarter but up 4% year-on-year reflected higher depreciation on auto lease growth. And we expect expense to be relatively flat into the first quarter as we continue to invest.","While on auto, 2015 set a record for new car sales with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December and we gained nearly 40 basis points of share year-over-year with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships driving growth. Finally, on credit, in auto net charge-offs were 50 basis points and while higher, they were still below our long-term expectations and in card, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 for the year, and given our underwriting discipline, client selection and the improving economy we expect net charge-offs to stay at these levels in 2016.","Now turning to Page 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenue of $7.1 billion and ROE of 10%. In Investment Banking for the full year, we continue to rank number one in global ID fees and number one in North America and EMEA. In M&A, we maintained our number two ranking and grew wallet share by 50 basis points. In ECM, we ranked number one globally, up from number 3 last year and in DCM we ranked number one across high yield, high grade and loans.","Banking revenue for the quarter of $1.5 billion was down 11% driven by lower debt underwriting fees. It was another outstanding performance in advisory fees, up 43% in the third quarter in a market that was down 12, largely driven by North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 4% in a market down 12 with the U.S. remaining somewhat slow but a resurgence of large transactions in Europe and Asia. And debt underwriting fees were down 43% from a record last year where we saw an unprecedented number of large fee events.","Treasury services revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter but down 4% year-on-year on lower deposit spreads. In markets, a number of factors contributed to a quiet fourth quarter overall across products. Investor risk appetite was significantly dampened by a series of market events and clients retrenched and derisked early. With that backdrop, the markets businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue in line with our expectations and normal seasonal trends. With adjusted revenues down 16% sequentially and 1% year-on-year.","In Fixed Income, rates markets were up given U.S. and ECB monetary policy actions offset by year-on-year declines in currencies in emerging markets as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainty being persisted as well as the commodities on reduced hedging and declines in credit on all those same things plus a number of single name corporate events.","Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker dealer services last year with strong performance in Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia compared to a strong prior year.","With respect to the first quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity we were light risk going into the year-end and inventory was low and so far our trading businesses are performing well. But as you know it is early and difficult to predict how the quarter will play out.","Security services revenue was $933 million in line with guidance given the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset based fees. For the first quarter, expect revenue to be approximately $900 million which includes seasonality. On credit, we saw a reserve build of $76 million which included $63 million related to oil and gas. Finally, expense of $4.4 billion was down 20% year-on-year mainly driven by lower legal. The comp to revenue ratio was 26% for the quarter and 30% for the full year.","Moving on to Page 11 and the Commercial Bank. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 15%. Revenue was up sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year with NII up 3% on higher loan balances despite spread compression offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year. However, for the full year, it was a record for Investment Banking with gross revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from 2014.","Expense of $750 million included $50 million of impairment on leased corporate aircraft. On the reassessment of residual values, the remaining balance sheet value of this portfolio is modest. We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in Commercial Real Estate of 17% exceeding the industry as we continue to invest in this business and gain share.","In C&I loans were up 11% largely driven by corporate client banking of on the back of several large transactions. Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong with only 4 basis points of net charge-offs. However, we did add $100 million to reserves, $60 million of which relates to oil and gas and $26 million for metals and mining.","Moving on to Page 12. Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $500 million with a 27% pretax margin and 21% ROE on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year-on-year driven by lower performance fees in alternatives. Expense of $2.2 billion was also down 5% year-on-year, roughly equally explained by lower performance fee driven compensation as well as a benefit from refining the value of the held for sale asset.","Assets under management of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.4 trillion were down 1% and 2% year-over-year respectively. We saw mixed flows in the fourth quarter resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion with solid inflows in equities being more than offset by weakness in fixed income and the loss of select mandates. However, we had strong long-term investment performance with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years which should be supportive of future flows. And for the full year, we had positive long-term inflows of $16 billion.","In lending, we had record balances of $110 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by both mortgage as well as traditional loans.","Turning to Page 13 and Corporate. Treasury and CIO reported net income of $138 million for the quarter. Included in this result is a pretax benefit of $178 million relating to certain securities held at a discount that were called at par. And this was in our NII. Other Corporate net income of $84 million included a net benefit of $60 million after tax for the legal related matters we discussed earlier as well as a contribution to our foundation this quarter of $150 million pretax.","Turning to Page 14. I've given you some guidance throughout the presentation and this page is for your reference. Obviously, when we get to Investor Day, we will give you a comprehensive outlook for each of our businesses for the year. So in summary, a solid quarter and a record for the full year, both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on higher capital translates to a good return on tangible common equity of 13.5%.","We exceeded our targets on expense management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by 2 percentage points. Delivered strong core loan growth of 16%, materially changed the mix of our deposit base including growing retail deposits at 10% and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our G-SIB surcharge and capital levels.","With that, operator, we'll take Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, Marianne.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken","So curious about whether or not you all have seen the stress we've seen in some of the credit and equity markets and some of the volatility impacting M&A velocity appetite amongst Boards and C-suites broadly in your conversations and throughout the IB?","Marianne Lake","So I mean, again, I would say that the pipeline coming into 2016 in M&A was good, solid, up, in fact. Obviously, volatility can dampen the confidence of Boards and CEOs. Dialogs are pretty active and we think the types of deals that we'll see in 2016 will look different. But I think in the first couple of weeks it's not being particularly strong and we do need to see some of the stability come back I think for us to really see that conversion start to pick up.","Brennan Hawken","And just by different, is that a reference to the size or can you be a bit more specific on what you mean?","Marianne Lake","Yes. Less mega deals, more mid-sized deals, more cross border, it's a little different. Actually more deal count, less big mega deals could be very constructive for revenue but we're likely to see it be a little bit different in 2016. But honestly the pipeline is good. And, yes.","Brennan Hawken","That's helpful.","Marianne Lake","North America will be a tough comp. It was very strong in 2015, but Europe could be very constructive.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific. Helpful. And then you referenced energy prices staying this low would lead to a significant reserve build, you expect in your energy book. Can you maybe give a little bit more color around that? How would you define significant and how long would oil need to stay down here in order to see some of that reserve action?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So the way we do our reserves, just for context because I think it's important is obviously the oil price outlook is important and instructive and it's very clearly going to drive how we think about probabilities of default and loss given default [for certain] [ph] customers. But I think it's also the case just for context to know that it is very name by name specific, specific conditions at clients matter greatly and so when we do these estimates they are directionally correct and order of magnitude correct, but that's just for context.","Oil, we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel, here we are and stayed there for call it 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million and that assessment hasn't fundamentally changed. So it is not the current market expectation that oil will flat line. It is the expectation right now that there will be a modest recovery. Based upon that we would expect to take some additional reserves but for them to be more modest, less significant. But that's kind of the range if oil's at $30 and stays here for a long time, up to $750 million.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I wanted to follow up on the oil and gas question. It just seems as though $124 million in additional provisions for oil and gas could be low, at least based on the one year forward prices for oil, which are still in the 30s and so my question's for Jamie. As you look back, how does the oil and gas situation today compare to prior periods of stress? We have 2002. We had the TMT meltdown when you were at Bank One you reduced the lines of credit. You got ahead of that early. In 2007, you weren't exactly at the start but then you adjusted and you said hey, this is a big issue. Now we have oil and gas, which could be another industry specific stress and you're only taking additional provisions of $124 million. Is that going to be enough and one year from now are you going to look back and say whoops we didn't get ahead of this enough.","Jamie Dimon","I think we try to be very conservative always and so we're not trying to put up as little as possible. You know me, I'd put up more if I could but accounting rules dictate what you can do. And these are baskets -- the real risk is in producing wells, cash flows are down, surprisingly the cost of getting the oil out of the ground has also dropped dramatically and probably much more than most of us would have expected. So you take these producing wells, you take the cash flow, you discount, you discounted it 8% or 9%, you lend against it. And so these are our forecasts.","Our energy book isn't that large relative to JPMorgan Chase. We're not worried about the big oil companies. These are mostly the smaller ones that you're talking about these reserve increases on.","Marianne Lake","I also think Mike just a -- ","Jamie Dimon","And the forward curve is -- at the end of the year for 2016 is like 41 or 42 or something like that.","Marianne Lake","Forty eight. So hey, Mike, the other thing to know about the sort of profile of reserves, three things. The first is, it's not linear. So just the oil price decline and the decline in the forward curve that we saw towards into December and to the end of the year, that's the impact it had on our reserves. It's fallen significantly in the first two quarters. That was not a knowable condition and we can't reserve for that at the end of the year. That's why we said we would expect to take some more reserve increases in the next couple of quarters. But again, it's a name specific thing and lots of other conditions at clients' matter including their hedging, their cash flows, the level of security, all those things.","Mike Mayo","And how do you use CDS to help protect yourself on that portfolio?","Jamie Dimon","We don't.","Mike Mayo","Okay, you don't. And then, the last follow-up. Do you intend to keep lending to the oil and gas companies as they run into problems? On the one hand, you have the risk of throwing good money after bad. On the other hand, if you stop lending as much and you have the high-yield market retreating and you have private equity firms retreating, maybe it becomes a liquidity crisis for some of the oil companies. Which is it, do you lend more or less to the oil and gas sector?","Jamie Dimon","The oil folks have been surprisingly resilient. Remember, these are asset backed loans. A bankruptcy doesn't necessarily mean your loan is bad; have to be a little bit careful. There is also, Mike a philosophical thing, a bank is supposed to be there for clients in good times and bad times. So it's not a trading market where you try to support clients. So then we can responsibly support clients, we are going to. And we lose a little bit more money because of it so be it. We've done that around the world. We did it in 2007, 2008 and 2009. We tried to do responsibly. If banks just completely pull out of markets every time something gets volatile and scary, you'll be sinking companies left and right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Stuart Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could remind us where you are on your expense reduction targets in the consumer and the investment bank and how does that translate to some thoughts about the expected trajectory of total firm-wide expenses for this year?","Marianne Lake","So let me just deal with where are against our targets. So the most notable targets were $2 billion in the consumer businesses in 2017 versus 2014 and $2.8 billion in the CIB in 2017 versus 2014. You probably heard my comment, but to clarify on an apples-to-apples basis we're halfway through on consumer. We have done $1 billion this year. You don't see that 100% translate into the results partly because of legal expense which is not something that we particularly can predict and hopefully won't see that forever. Also because we intentionally decisioned in 2015 in the fourth quarter in particular, mostly, to increase our investments in the consumer businesses by $150 million. So we've achieved the $1 billion. We chose to reinvest a portion of it. Another $1 billion we're on track for. We will potentially reinvest some of that too and Gordon and we will talk to you about the basis for that at Investor Day.","On the $2.8 billion in the CIB, we're $1.3 billion through at the end of the year and we talked before about the fact that the first $1.3 billion is largely on business simplification. We've had the revenue decline. We need to have expense decline and we worked hard to deliver that and we have. The next chunk is to do with technology and operations and infrastructure and organization and it's harder. And so we will continue with them on track to deliver it, but it's going to be a job through 2016 and into 2017.","John McDonald","And how does that all net into an outlook for this year if you're willing to give us some thoughts on that.","Marianne Lake","Yes, I can give you some thoughts that won\u2019t totally satisfy you which is our core expenses will continue to trend down on the back of delivering against them. We will make investment decisions that we think are good for the company, accretive for shareholders, that will respend some of that money. And so we'll give you that shrink and grow at Investor Day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the benefits from rates as they come through, obviously your commentary that NII will be even flattish in the first quarter adjusted for day count and even with some securities gains in the numbers this quarter presumes that a nice helper from that first move. And you guys are really conservative on your deposit beta thoughts when you talked about them previously.","I know probably haven't seen much change yet but you how are you expecting the deposit behavior to act and there has been any change to your modeling expectations about what might come through as we get through the first couple of hikes.","Marianne Lake","So just on NII, yes, we are seeing embedded in that sort of NII flat to slightly. We are seeing a nice lift associated with the rate hike in December across businesses as well as the continued benefit of the mix towards loans in our balance sheet, but we were flatted in our NII this quarter by $178 million on securities gains in CIO. So that's going to mean the comparison is changing and day count is obviously seasonal. So that's being dynamic. We are seeing the rate benefit. We do expect to see it as I said in my remarks for the full year.","Look, we think we are appropriately conservative on deposit meters. It is not -- it is way too early to have any idea. Virtually nothing has moved yet. And so our job and what we are doing is paying very close attention to the competitive landscape. These deposits that we're talking about that have the high basis are valuable deposits with valuable clients for us and we want to be competitive and pay fair rates. But it's so early in the movie that we haven't changed much in our modeling assumptions. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. And my second question, if I can ask an ex-energy credit question. A lot of concerns we're going to get into some type of broader deterioration of which your numbers showed no signs of heading towards --what are you looking for? Are you seeing any signals of ex-energy changes in either delinquencies or watch trends and are you still comfortable with kind of that low 4s type of charge-off expectation that you guys had talked about previously? Thanks.","Marianne Lake","So energy, metals and mining, we're watching very closely industries that could have knock on effects like industrials and transportation but we're not seeing anything broadly in our portfolio right now. We're just watching very closely, which is why -- now, obviously, you can take our reserve build number and you can say it's almost essentially all made up of oil and gas and metals and mining and behind the scenes we've had upgrades and down grades of a number of other different companies across sectors but nothing particularly thematic yet but we're watching.","Jamie Dimon","Now, you point out that credit card, Commercial Bank, middle market, large Corporate credit is as good as it's ever been. Obviously, it's going to get a little bit worse. I wouldn't call it a cycle per se. If you have a recession you will see a normal cyclical increase in all those losses. We're not forecasting a recession. We think the U.S. economy looks pretty good at this point.","Operator","Your next question -- ","Marianne Lake","So based on that with the obvious caveat of what happens with oil prices and energy over the course of the near future, yes, we would still expect our charge-offs to be relatively low.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thank you. So I think you talked about some of this Marianne in terms of the method 2 of surcharge now estimated at 3.5. I'm just curious, I think if the numbers are right, you took down notionals and there is about $4.321 trillion in level three assets, $50 billion in non-op deposits. You've said that you don't want to be an outlier, so you're whittling that down. I'm curious of the driving force behind it, what kind of revenue give-up there is in such a move like this because we like it and thoughts on the go forward.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So look, we talked about achieving 4% last quarter I think and for disclosure we were quite close to 3.5. At that point it becomes increasingly compelling to want to look at the margin for what you could do to get within the bucket and so that is what we did in the fourth quarter is spend time really focusing on getting to that achievable boundary which we thought at that point its was.","And remember, if not nothing in the year that we started the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of non-operating deposits and while there still could be some volatility in that number of course, we've almost doubled that or doubled that in fact. So we got some wind to our backs in doing it.","It's also the case that when you get the entire business and company attuned to the sense of urgency and desire to want to be increasingly efficient in this way, that at the margin in our 100 different things little benefits accrue. So we're at about 3.5, we're just inside the 3.5% bucket as best we estimate it. It's not as much important whether we're basis points or surcharge points below or above it, it's much more what we do now to get safely in the bucket. And that's going to still take work. So that's why he we'll obviously talk to you more about this at Investor Day.","In terms of the give up from an economic perspective we wouldn't have done it at any cost. We have done it because we think it is important to do because we think it's going to be constructive for the company and because the revenue give-ups were not significant but they weren't zero either. But to be able to reduce a constraint that is in one way or another likely to bind us in multiple ways in fact likely to bind us. It was a -- I think very good trade.","Jamie Dimon","It was done effectively, client by client.","Marianne Lake","Yes.","Jamie Dimon","Make sure we are trying to do the right things for our clients not just jamming our balance sheet down and hurting people.","Glenn Schorr","Fair enough. I just had one quick follow-up on Ken's last question. If two-third of the economy is consumer led. You look at all your early stage delinquencies like Ken said. And Jamie to your comments, things look okay. I hate putting words in your mouth but what do you think the disconnect then is between what's going on in the markets versus what's going on in the trends in your business, both in terms of growth and forward-looking credit books.","Jamie Dimon","The U.S. economy has been chugging along at 2% to 2.5% growth for better part of five years now. In the last two years it has created 5 million jobs. And when you look -- if you look at the actual household formation, car sales, wage, people working, it still looks okay. Corporate credit is quite good. Small business formation, it's not back to where it was but it's quite good. Household formation is going up. So, obviously, market turmoil we all look at it every day but I'm not sure most of the 143 million Americans look at it that much who have jobs and you have a big change in the world out there. People are getting adjusted to China slowing down. When you have commodity prices go down like that there are big winners and losers. The oil companies are the losers. Consumers are the benefit. Brazil gets hurt. India benefits. South Korea benefits. Japan benefits. And those kind of terribly worse and hopefully this will all settle down. It's not the beginning of something really bad.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Hi. The disclosure around the oil and gas is really helpful. And I was wondering, if you could just walk through something similar on metals and mining. So you gave us the -- I think you said $68 million of full year reserve build and you gave us the not significant if things stay where they are. Can you give us the balance and then is there a comparable $500 million to $750 million stress test for oil and gas or stress case, is there a comparable, what is the stress case if broader commodities in metals and mining comes in worse. ","Marianne Lake","Okay. So our total reserves on balance sheet for metals and mining notwithstanding we built $60-odd million. This year it's over $200 million. So the coverage ratio is pretty good. The exposure is about -- I haven't got the precise numbers in front of me. They're a third the size of our exposure to oil and gas. So that 2% of our overall wholesale credit exposure. So considerably more modest, which is why if energy prices and general commodity weakness and stress stays where it is right now, even for an extended period we would think that the incremental reserves would be considerably more modest.","Jamie Dimon","And it's also that one is mostly name by name.","Marianne Lake","Yes, for sure.","Jamie Dimon","It's not big asset based reserves. It's the big corporate credits name by name.","Marianne Lake","And so both oil and gas and metals and mining in our portfolio, oil and gas is close to 60% investment grade and metals and mining about half.","Brian Foran","And then on I guess staying with credit, on home equities and the whole issue of free cash from interest home-made amortizing. Can you kind of lay out how it's progressed relative to your expectations so far and also remind us how big the allocation of the reserve is against that and I guess not to lead the witness, but is that an area where things are trending early days better than expected and could provide some buffer against maybe anything else that happens on the C&I side?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So with respect to home equity reclass, remember the majority of the problematic home equity underwriting for 2005 to 2008. So here we are at the beginning of 2016 with sort of [indiscernible]. But we're monitoring it closely and we have some reclass that have happened, obviously interest rates are low. Home price appreciation on the other hand [indiscernible] and there are puts and takes.","We've been monitoring I would say at the margin or more than at the margin at early stages coming in better than we had modeled and remember from an incurred loss perspective we would consider these reclass risks to be largely incurred. So we tried to reserve them to the best of our ability, so we feel good about our reserve but I think we disclosed them. But so far from a performance perspective, I would say slightly better than our models but we continue to monitor it because it's still relatively early.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Marianne, I know that the Basel committee put our their fundamental review of the trading book proposal this morning, so clearly no one's had time to really go through it in detail. However, I'm sure you've already gone through the prior proposals and done the QISs for the last couple of years. The proposal is better than what had been -- the ruling is better than what the proposal most recently had been.","Just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you can manage to this 2019 implementation timeframe. Are there things set in motion already or is this something that you would start from here? And if you could just give us some broad strokes on how you think about overall impact that would be helpful.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, obviously, you'll forgive me because we've been on call since it came out but yes we have been working on this for years. The problem with this particular rule is as you stated based upon the four QISs that were done there were some -- I would characterize significant challenges with respect to the rules as written and we were expecting there to be a number of meaningful changes and there have been. In many cases meaningful improvements. But it's very technical and there's been a lot of changes so we need to suture it to figure out net-net everything.","Although it is clear that net-net despite factors the faith and intention of the committee wasn't necessary to increase market risk capital across the industry, it will be higher but by how much it's really going to need to be sifted through and for that same reason, for both those same reasons, I'm sorry, for the reason that the rule has not been stable and there have been significant questions, many of which have been either addressed or partially addressed many I guess that have not.","It would have been premature to have taken any actions in advance of figuring out where this has landed and you as you know the period, so the comply is three years. So it's more of a start from here to figure out how to manage with this after we sifted through the details. So I wish I were able to give you a little bit more of a detailed answer but we're going to need to take the time to go through it.","Betsy Graseck","Right. I totally understand that. And I guess my basic question is, you can take action as opposed to just deal with what the current decision would be for you. There are actions that you can take to reduce the impact.","Marianne Lake","Well, there are always actions we can take to reduce the impact. And so we have to think about them in the context of our overall capital optimization program, and again, if there are -- if some of the things that we hope -- and honestly I've been on call since it came out. Some of the things we hoped were going to be addressed have not. They could have had or may have meaningful impact on the specific types of activity. And we will have to react accordingly. And yes, we will take actions if that's the right answer. I wish I could give you more details but we just need to go through it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura.","Steve Chubak","Hi, good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning.","Steve Chubak","So I had a couple of questions on capital. The first relates to the RWA progress which did surprise positively in the year by about $50 billion ahead of expectations. And I was just hoping you can give a better sense, Marianne, just given some of your prepared remarks, as to how much of that incremental $50 billion reduction was a function of more proactive mitigation efforts, maybe even tied to the mitigation efforts that you guys had talked about which should presumably remain in the run rate versus balance sheet shrinkage that may be due to the risk loss environment that we're experiencing today.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say that based upon our sort of fourth quarter balance sheet given that market risk was a driver, given that balance sheet levels were a driver particularly on standardized, we could give back on standardized as much as 10 to 20 bps of capital, of the 10.7% capital accretion. But the bigger points on the RWA outlook is that we expect to be bound over the medium term by standardized and standardized is going to always have a neutral to upward pressure as we continue to grow these high quality loans.","So even though the RWA is being at the 1.5-ish trillion dollars sooner than we expected is obviously good news regardless of how much that may in the short-term reverse. Our job is going to be to continue to become more efficient to try and keep it there just given the natural upward pressure of the standardized calculations.","We can become more efficient in advance but we're unlikely to be bound by it in the medium term. So that's what we're focused on. I wouldn't take the 1.5 trillion in read through that we'll be continuing to decline from here on standardized. We'll be continuing to work hard to make sure that we can grow those loans that we love but that have [indiscernible] under a standardized basis.","Steve Chubak","Understood, Marianne. That's very helpful. And then maybe just switching gears to the G-SIB surcharge. Clearly the progress surprise positively, getting down to 3.5%, I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about establishing minimum capital targets. I recognize you'll likely lay that out at Investor Day. Just want to get a better sense as to what methodology are you employing in terms of thinking about a management buffer and all the different binding constraints that you have to manage to day-to-day and thinking about through the cycle target that you guys would like to manage to.","Marianne Lake","Okay. If I missed something at the end remind me. So in terms of how we think about buffers just really conceptually, the firm manages and the Board has set for the firm a risk appetite. That risk appetites has a number of features and capital depletion in a stress environment is one of them. And so when we think about setting buffers we think about it just broadly you in the contexts of allowing ourselves enough room to absorb losses within our risk appetite and not have to take premature actions from a capital perspective.","So but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent at the 50 basis point level for a reasonable period of time and we'll update you on all of that at Investor Day. With respect to our target, it's a little bit more complicated than minimum regulatory capital because as you say we're bound potentially by multiple constraints and one of them may be CCAR. Plus -- well, it is CCAR I should say because as you know the first two quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have already been approved. And we haven't done CCAR but this is not any kind of prediction, but it wouldn't surprise you to know that it's unlikely we will pay out 100% of our earnings in CCAR going forward. So we are on a path to continue to accrete capital though we would like to move in our payout range. So given that we're still moving towards our 12% target and we will update you if any of that changes at Investor Day.","We'll also as you know potentially going to understand whether or not the Fed changes any of the CCAR parameters and whether that has an impact. So at the moment the best we know is that we're going to continue to accrete capital albeit more slowly as we hope to move up in the payout range. But we haven't done CCAR yet. And that's if the rules don't change. So 12% is for now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks. Marianne, if I could just clarify your NII comment from the very beginning of the call. Do I understand correctly that the $2 billion of incremental NII that you've cited is just a function of the repricing dynamic as they move through your balance sheet or is there also I guess a contribution from loan growth?","Marianne Lake","So think about in a rate scenario when you can pick whether you believe the market, or whether you think the market is or whether you believe the [indiscernible]. And I think it's going to be data dependent. So we're not going to have a stated opinion on that. But because of the mix in our balance sheet in 2015 as well as our expectation of continued loan growth we would expect mix to contribute about half of that and the first 25 basis points about the next half because we are more sensitive to the front of rise and the first 25 basis points. And you can see that in our earnings and risk disclosures.","So even if we see nothing else. Obviously, we believe and the market believes that you're going to see a couple more hikes. That would be on average another 25 basis points. That would be incremental NII again.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thank you. And so I know we just touched on RWAs but how do you suggest we think about GAAP assets for this year?","Marianne Lake","I would say I would think about them in a somewhat similar directional way, given that our balance sheet ended below $2.4 trillion. A little bit of it market delivered a lot of it purposeful. But we do intend to continue to gather deposits and extend loans and portfolio loans as well. So while you will see some security balances decline and the like, I would say again net modest growth, about modest and very lending driven.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. I just wanted to -- I had a follow-up question on fixed income trading. I think Dan Pinto has talked benefits from higher rates and so I guess number one, I wanted to see if you had had any thoughts on that, have you seen any initial benefits to spreads in the fixed trading market with the first rate hike. In contrast you've had a couple of competitors announce or at least reported that they're cutting headcount. That seems to be a little bit in contrast to the expectation that fixed income to pick up with higher rates. So if you could sort of talk through your thoughts on fixed income. I do notice that you did mention 1Q is off to performing well. So maybe that's part of it too. But if you could help on that, that would be great.","Marianne Lake","So in terms of the impact of rates, obviously, there was a lot of monetary policy confusion broadly in the fourth quarter, the ECB underwound the Fed. There was a lot of confusion. By the time the rate hike happened it was obviously pretty well understood. We did see strong activity or strong client activity relatively speaking on the back of that in the rates business, more so than necessarily about spreads.","With respect to the fixed income business, we've always been very disciplined about how we think about the staffing levels and expenses in that business. We've managed it very carefully. The compensation has come down across the trading businesses and it wouldn't surprise you that some of that -- a lot of that has been in fixed income. And business is upscale and productive. So --","Jim Mitchell","So you still feel pretty comfortable with your outlook that things could improve and market share gain potential as competitors pull back.","Jamie Dimon","You've even in fixed income -- we have a very good fixed income operation globally around the world. Rates themselves don't filter through fixed trading directly. I think what Danny was talking about if you have a healthy economies and confident investors you have more volume in things like that. We do see a little bit of repricing taking place. Prime broker, repo, conduit some of those run through FERC. That is going to take place as the world adjusts to new -- all the new capital requirements. And obviously, a lot of seasonality in the business which you've experienced for the last decade.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. My questions have been asked and answered.","Marianne Lake","Thanks, Erika.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Hi. If we look at credit spreads in the bond market even ex-energy they've widened considerably and I'm wondering if this has resulted in wholesale credit being repriced at all. I realize the bond market doesn't set bank loan pricing but just wondering if you've been able to reprice some of the wholesale customers or expect being able to do so.","Jamie Dimon","We've seen no real repricing in loans on the balance sheet. You have seen a little bit of it, people are getting other revenues to make up for their credit exposure.","Marianne Lake","Yes. I mean think about the bank loans as being relationship loans that need to be sort of in the context of relationship and everybody is they --","Jamie Dimon","They bought them. They really repriced in 2008 and 2009. Banks were continue to lend up at existing price but these were long-term relationships. Bank loan not reprice like the markets do.","Matt O'Connor","I guess I wonder why like we saw pricing in the debt markets come in considerably over the last several years. C&I pricing came in. I realize it might take some time. But I would think there's some opportunity for some repricing around the edges, no?","Jamie Dimon","Well, we haven't seen it.","Marianne Lake","Also, it's very, very competitive. Everybody has been chasing these loans. And so that's a factor too. So we haven't seen it yet.","Jamie Dimon","The number at middle market lending, if I remember correctly, if you look at it by client, 60% of the revenues are not loan related. So clients, they also know what the relationship is to the bank. While we need to make a good return on capital, capital tied to a client is only partially loan related. That capital on its own doesn't earn an adequate return. Simple lending on its own generally not an adequate return business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Jamie to follow up on your comments about maybe some better pricing in prime brokerage and repo because of the capital requirements or requiring you guys to raise prices, can you expand upon that? Do you see it growing where you could get even better pricing going forward because of less competition. Can you give us more color there?","Jamie Dimon","I think the better way to look at it is people seem in certain of our businesses and I mentioned those and there are some other ones, capital has been deployed, people have adjusted to the new rules and you've seen pricing go up. But it goes up a lot. I wouldn't count on it going up a lot more from there. The markets are going to be competitive at that point. The use of balance sheet, the cost has gone up. Not loans but most of the other stuff.","Marianne Lake","And remember we think about our prime brokerage business going hand in glove with equity.","Jamie Dimon","That's correct, Marianne.","Marianne Lake","And so while the repricing is helpful and everybody is going to continue to always observe their pricing. We built our platform internationally, Europe we are seeing strong demand for our traffic product. In Asia we're adding clients. We've got the wind to our backs. So it's an important business to our clients. You're right there are some other people potentially not going to be as aggressive and if we can take share, we certainly will.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then the follow-up question is obviously the FASB is coming out this quarter with the new loan loss reserve methodology, the current expected credit loss versus what we're using today. Obviously the incurred loss model. There's going to be a true-up for everybody. Have you guys given any thought that when this goes into place when you may take that true-up, assuming say you have to implement it by 2019, or something like that, would you do it much before that or can you give us some thoughts on your thinking about what's going to happen.","Marianne Lake","Well, obviously we expect any transition adjustment to go through equity. If we are able to adopt it early we might do that. I'm not aware that we are.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul Miller","Thank you very much. We know that you implemented a new disclosure form in the mortgage banking space trend. Did that have any -- you guys had very good mortgage banking results. Did that have any impact whatsoever on your operations in the mortgage bank?","Marianne Lake","So, yes, obviously it was -- I think if you add up other servicing rules, print them out, put them on the floor and stand them next to me they're a foot taller. They are very complicated. There's a lot of operational complexity to complying. And we're working very hard at doing that. I would say in the quarter we did as part of being cautious about making sure that we're complying, our cycle times were a couple days, few days worsened. And so volumes, our origination volumes are a little lower than we would have otherwise seen that's a lot. And that's just timing and it's just days. But not really from a financial results perspective because of the way we recognize revenue. So I would call it a little bit of teaming products across the industry, by the way, not just us, nothing significant. We are going to get the work finished and so it talks. It is what it is.","Paul Miller","And then a follow-up question on your portfolio. You look like you grew your residential loans by about $11 billion. Last quarter you said it was a mix between agency and jumbo. If it's a big chunk of it's agency can you give us your thoughts on portfolio of that agency product.","Marianne Lake","Yes. so, it's about 60% jumbo, 40% agency or conventional performing and it's a better execution decision. So when we look at the better economics between selling or portfolioing the mortgage we'll generally choose the better economics but we also prefer the annuity nature of the NII, the lower servicing risk and the better capital efficiency. So it has been the case over the course of the last several quarters that it has been the best execution to portfolio of these mortgages and actually they are generating a nice return on equity. ","Operator","And you do have a follow-up question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald","One quick follow-up, Marianne. You've had some pretty big tax gains the last couple quarters, running below 30% of your tax rate. At some point do you pull forward future benefits and run with a higher tax rate in the future.","Marianne Lake","We have had pretty big tax gains over the course of the last -- most notably over the last quarter, of course, the last couple of years. Most of those related to the sort of call it 2003 through 2008 tax period when we were going through the financial crisis and so some of the matters were more complex and we took appropriate reserving decisions on that. There are many less of those very complicated matters ahead of us and so we wouldn't expect to see the same sort of size of tax benefit going forward as we've seen in the past. But we had some this quarter.","So we'll have a few and generally speaking they are because of the nature of the reserving perhaps generally speaking we take a conservative approach and bias to the positive but it could be much more plus or minus zero at this point.","John McDonald","So what's your natural tax rate if you don't have those. Is around 30 or is it closer to -- ?","Marianne Lake","Thirty.","John McDonald","Thanks.","Operator","You have another follow-up question from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Marianne Lake","Hi, Brian. ","Brian Foran","I was wondering if I could just sneak in on credit cards. Do you think the competitive environment has hit a plateau and on co-brands are there any kind of large upcoming repricing events and is there any bigger than a bread box size you can give on, Marianne?","Marianne Lake","So do I think it's plateaued? I think it remains incredible competitive generally, particularly in the co-brand space. So plateaued at a very competitive level I suppose. But in terms of -- I'm not going to talk about any specific names, actually, Brian in terms of the potential for repricing. It's an important part of our business and we're going to defend our business.","Brian Foran","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Marianne Lake","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Hi, Marianne. If the regulators lift the dividend payout ratio in this year's CCAR to 40%, would you guys consider lifting your dividend payout ratio something closer to that?","Marianne Lake","Well, it's a Board decision and so neither have we received that guidance from the regulators nor have we done CCAR and had that discussion yet with the Board. But we have generally said that the Board likes to have the flexibility to increase dividends over time and we have had our dividend most recently sort of at or close to that soft cap. So we would love that capacity and I would imagine that over time it may be used but again, it is a Board decision, not a management decision.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then just one last follow-up. On the G-SIB buffer, obviously you guys have done an incredible job in bringing it down to where it is today. When do you expect the regulators to put you into that bucket assuming you guys are obviously looking at the same types of numbers?","Marianne Lake","So, from we do have -- so, first of all, I would say the following. Right now my understanding and if I'm wrong forgive me is that your spot balance sheet two years prior that would drive your two years forward. But the reality is, if you want my opinion given that we're going to be reporting quarterly going forward and because of the likelihood that G-SIB may or may not feature into CCAR. I think it's going to be less important necessarily what you're at any one moment in time, but where you are projecting to be or stay. I suspect that we will get the benefit potentially of this, not today. We disclosed our balance sheet. But I think it's going to need to be a little bit more dynamic going forward as it guess potentially introduced into stress test.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Marianne Lake","But I don't know that.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Marianne Lake","Thank you everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.","Jennifer Piepszak","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.","Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.1 billion and EPS of $2.68 on record revenue of $30.1 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 18%. Underlying performance continue to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in Consumer Banking, up 13%; strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volume in Home Lending and Auto; and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in Card; number one in global IB fees year-to-date with over 9% wallet share and record growth IB revenues in middle market; and in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw record AUM and client assets.","Overall, for the firm, total loans were flat year-on-year, which includes continued mortgage loan sales. SC sales loans were up 3% on healthy growth in Card and AUM. Total deposits were up 5%, with strength across wholesale and retail. And credit performance remained strong across business.","On to Page 2 and some more detail about our third quarter results. Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year-on-year as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion year-on-year or 14%, driven by strong performance across Fixed Income Markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million. Expenses of $16.4 billion were up 5% on volume and revenue-related expenses as well as continued investments, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. ","Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.5 billion, reflecting modest net reserve build and charge-offs in line with expectations. And as we mentioned last quarter, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale.","Now on the balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.3%, up about 10 basis points versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.6 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share.","Now on to Page 4 for a look at our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year-on-year. Revenue of $14.3 billion was up 7% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels. ","Revenue was up 5%, driven by higher NII on deposit growth and margin expansion as well higher noninterest revenue on higher transaction volumes. And even though the deposit margin is higher year-on-year, not surprisingly, it is down 13 basis points quarter-on-quarter given the current rate environment. ","Home Lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales.","With regards to these loan sales, it's important to note the net impact to Home Lending revenue is minimal with the gain on sale being offset by a funding charge from Corporate. And in Card, Merchant Services & Auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 10%, and merchant processing volume was up 11%. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.","On credit, starting with reserves. This quarter, CCB had a net reserve build of $50 million, which included a build in card of $200 million, largely offset by releases of $100 million in Home Lending and $50 million in Business Banking. The build in Cards is primarily driven by mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, largely driven by Card and consistent with expectations.","Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $2.8 billion and an ROE of 13% on revenue of $9.3 billion.","Investment Banking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year in a market that was down. It was a record third quarter for investment banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory. Year-to-date, we continue to rank number one in overall IB wallet and gain share across products and regions, benefiting from our leadership position in technology and health care sectors.","In advisory, we were down 13% year-on-year, reflecting lower deal activity compared to a strong prior year. However, we continue to gain wallet share, driven by our strategic investments. In debt underwriting, we were up 17% year-on-year in a market that was down. Here, we benefited from our participation in some large transactions and increased activity in investment-grade bonds. ","In equity underwriting, we were up 22% year-on-year, significantly outperforming the market, driven by our strong performance in IPOs and convertibles. And for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we ranked number one in wallet share for overall ECM and IPOs. We expect fourth quarter IBCs to be down both sequentially and year-on-year driven by strong performances in the third quarter and prior year. However, the pipeline remains healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the lower rate environment has made debt issuance more attractive.","Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $5.1 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Fixed Income Markets was up 25%, a good result, which also benefited from a comparison to a somewhat quiet quarter in the prior year. This quarter was characterized by strong client activities across the board with outperformance in agency mortgage trading and improved flows in rates and commodities.","Equity Markets was down 5% against a very strong third quarter last year. Equity derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but prime remained strong and cash outperformed relative to the prior year. Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, down 7% and 2% year-on-year, respectively. The rate environment remains a relative headwind, primarily from the funding basis compression we've been talking about, which is largely firm-wide neutral, and to a lesser extent, client-specific repricing in Treasury Services. But importantly, the organic growth in fees and balances continues to be strong.","Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges. And finally, credit costs were $92 million, driven largely by reserve builds on select emerging market client downgrades.","Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $937 million and an ROE of 16%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower NII, driven by lower deposit margin, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue due to strong investment banking performance. Gross Investment Banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year-on-year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity, and we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market.","Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year-on-year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges. Deposit balances were up 3% year-on-year on strong client flows. Loan balances were flat year-on-year across both C&I and CRE. ","In C&I, while we are seeing pockets of growth in select industries, like financial institutions, technology and energy, there does continue to be significant runoff in our tax exempt portfolio. And in CRE, although there was higher origination activity in Commercial Term Lending, it was largely offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $67 million with a net charge-off rate of 9 basis points.","Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $668 million with pretax margin of 25% and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments in technology and advisers, partially offset by lower distribution and legal fees. Credit costs were $44 million, driven by net charge-offs as well as reserve builds on loan growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $40 billion, driven by fixed income, and net liquidity inflows of $24 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets was $3.1 trillion, both record, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products as well as higher market levels. Deposits were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in interest-bearing products. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 7% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending.","Now on to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $393 million. Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix as well as the funding offset from the lower mortgage loan sale that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates. This quarter also included small net gains in certain legacy private equity investments compared to approximately $200 million of net losses in the prior year. And expenses of $281 million were up $253 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher investments in technology and a prior year net legal benefit.","Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook. Our full year outlook remains in line with previous guidance. We expect net interest income to come in slightly below $57.5 billion, based on the latest implieds; and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65.5 billion.","So to wrap up, the U.S. economy is on solid footing. And while global growth is slowing, the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Despite continued macro uncertainty and headwinds from the rate environment, this quarter showcases the diversification and scale of our business model. We remain well positioned to outperform in any environment, and we'll continue to strategically invest in our businesses. ","And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Curious your take on everything that went on in the repo markets during the quarter, and I would love it if you could put it in the context of maybe the fourth quarter of last year. If I remember correctly, you stepped in, in the fourth quarter. So higher rates, threw money at it, made some more money, and it calmed the markets down. I'm curious what's different this quarter that, that did not happen. And curious if you think we need changes in the structure of the market to function better on a go-forward basis.","James Dimon","So if I remember correctly, you got to look at the concept of -- we have a checking account at the Fed with a certain amount of cash in it. Last year, we had more cash than we needed for regulatory requirements. So repo rates went up, we went with the checking account which paid IOER into repo. Obviously makes sense, you make more money. But now the cash in the account, which is still huge. It's $120 billion in the morning, and it goes down to $60 billion during the course of the day and back to $120 billion at the end of the day. That cash, we believe, is required under resolution and recovery and liquidity stress testing. And therefore, we could not redeploy it into repo market, which we would've been happy to do. And I think it's up to the regulators to decide they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep in that account. ","And again, I look at this as technical. A lot of reasons why those balances dropped to where they were. I think a lot of banks are in the same position, by the way. But I think the real issue when you think about it, is does that mean that we have bad markets because that's kind of hitting a red line in that checking account. You're also going to hit a red line in LCR, like HQLA, which cannot be redeployed either. So to me, that will be the issue when the time comes. ","And it's not about JPMorgan. JPMorgan declined -- in any event, it's about how the regulators want to manage the system and who they want to intermediate when the time comes.","Jennifer Piepszak","And it's worth noting, Glenn, that the overall impact to JPMorgan from the events in mid-September was not material one way or another to our third quarter results.","Glenn Schorr","Yes. I feel bad for whoever borrowed at 10%. Okay. Just a quickie on NII. I heard you on the full year '19 commentary -- and I don't think that's surprising, maybe a little bit better. Have you done much repositioning on the balance sheet as we look forward in 2020, which is looking like an obviously lower rate backdrop? I want to ask you what your thoughts around 2020 NII, but I'd rather hear the soft call because I know you're not going to give it to us.","Jennifer Piepszak","Well, I'll try. So in terms of balance sheet positioning, as you know, we have a negatively convexed balance sheet. We manage it in both directions. Some moves in interest rates are hedge-able and some are not. In a quarter like we just had, with the rally that we had, you would expect us to buy duration and we did. But in terms of 2020, the way I think you can think about it is we've given you full year 2019, which implies a fourth quarter just under $14 billion. Frankly, that's not a bad place to start. There will be some puts and takes. Obviously, you would have to get the full run rate of the October cut because, of course, they're developing from the implieds, and then there's one more cut next year. But an offset to that, at least a partial offset to that, would be balance sheet growth and mix. So we'll give you more color on Investor Day, as we always do, and we'll be in a better position then. But the fourth quarter of '19 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions, one on your GSIB bucket. I know, as of the end of June, it showed that you had bumped up into the next GSIB bucket, and I wanted to understand how you're thinking about managing that as we go into year-end. And is there a plan to get back down? And how would you effect that?","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure. So as it relates to GSIB, we fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year-end. As you know, most aspects of GSIB are on a spot basis, so we will manage it like we do any scarce resource and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year-end.","Betsy Graseck","But is there -- does that impact just your market position in general? Is there anything that you would be looking to doing to get there that might reduce your positioning in some of the businesses that you're involved in, for example, things like derivatives, et cetera? Or is it really not? Is it going to be something that we're not going to see in the revenues because it's too small to matter to you?","James Dimon","I couldn't say.","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes. What we need to do across the various GSIB buckets will not be obvious in our fourth quarter results. But like I said, we will be managing and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket. It's more than just leverage.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian","My first question is a follow-up to Glenn's question. As you think about the cross current of resolution planning, LCR, and liquidity stress testing, could you help us -- what is the level of excess deployable cash at JPMorgan?","James Dimon","I said we have $120 billion in our checking accounts with the Fed, and it goes down to $60 billion and then back to $120 during the average day. But we believe the requirement under CLAR and resolution recovery is that when we'd opened that account such that if there's extreme stress, during the course of day, it doesn't go below 0. You go back to before the crisis you go below 0 all the time during the day. So the question is, how far is that as a red line was the intent to regulate to a CLAR resolution to lock up that much of reserves in account of Fed. And that will be up for regulators to decide. But right now, we have to meet those rules. And we don't want to violate anything we told them we're going to do.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And as my follow-up, Jen, if -- you said something about the offset to the 2 Fed cuts that are in the forward curve would be balance sheet growth and mix. Could you give us a little bit more color on how you're expecting those dynamics to play out, particularly given slightly lower core loan growth this quarter and 22% increase in investment securities balances?","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure. Well, I'll come back to investment securities balances. But in terms of balance sheet growth in 2020, you can think about largely in deposits. And just as one example, obviously, the rate environment and the economy will matter a whole lot. But just in a declining rate environment, the higher-yielding alternatives for consumers are less attractive. And so we do expect to continue to grow the franchise. And we could see healthy growth in the deposit base. So that's what I was referring to. ","In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on. As I said earlier, we did buy duration. But importantly, what you see in investment securities are also cash deployment strategies as well as actions we took on the back of the mortgage loan sales. So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter.","James Dimon","In some cases, securities at a higher return on standardized capital than certain mortgage loans did.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.","Michael Mayo","So you, I guess, lowered your guidance for NII, but also lowered your guidance for expenses. So how much of that lower expense guidance is due to the deployment of technology? Or just more generally, at every Investor Day, you tell us you're going to spend, what, $12 billion on technology. And we don't really have a lot of insight into the traction that those technology investments are getting. So what's working technology-wise? What's not working? And how much of that can contribute to your improved expense guidance?","Jennifer Piepszak","Okay. Sure. So I'll start, and if you want to add. So I would say, Mike, the NII guidance is not lower. At the second quarter, we said $57.5 billion, plus or minus. At the time, the implieds said 3 rate cuts: July, September and December. And we said if there were 2 or more, that would be $57.5 billion minus; and if less than that, perhaps $57.5 billion plus. And so we are kind of right where we said we would be. And we're a little bit higher than what we said earlier in September at Barclays, and that's because we got a little bit of a tailwind on the 10-year and some balanced growth and 1 less cut in December. So I would say NII guidance broadly in line. ","On expenses in technology, there's a few things you can think about. First of all, broadly speaking, on expenses, I would say we remain committed to what we said at Investor Day in terms of the cost curve flattening from here. But importantly, you have to look at the underlying story, which I know is what you're getting at, which is there are volume or revenue-related expenses. And we're always looking for productivity there, and -- but they will be what they will be. They will come with top line growth. ","In terms of investments, we will continue with the discipline we always have around business cases and net present value and payback periods. But we will also always invest in the things we think we need to need to, even if they're a table fix. ","And then there's productivity, which is your point. And so we continue to realized productivity in our investments, and we continue to think we have opportunity ahead. We haven't laid that out in terms of quantifying it, but some of the things you can think about are robotics replacing repetitive processes. You can think about machine learning or AI in fraud. So machine learning assisting us in decision-making processes. Our call centers are always getting more productive. As Gordon said at Investor Day, our cost to serve in the consumer businesses are down 15%. And then digital capabilities that we're rolling out to our customers in terms of self-service is not only better for them, but more efficient for us. And so we have realized significant productivity to date in not only in our technology investments, but other investments, and think still have room to run.","James Dimon","As you said, in our merchant processing systems, and API store for the CIB. The stuff we built to hooking all that into our custody business. So you can go business-by-business and see the extensive amount of stuff we're rolling out. And it's pretty good.","Michael Mayo","All right. Let me have one follow-up then. So I mean how many call center personnel do you have? Or how many data centers do you have? And how does that compare to the peak?","James Dimon","We're building many data centers as we speak. I forgot the total number, but it's quite a few. The new ones will be better, more efficient and more expandable and safe and more secure, all that kind of stuff. And we have to build that infrastructure. We have the best in the world. So we're not going to ever scrimp on something like that. And maybe at Investor Day, we can go a little bit more into how we try to manage the technology budget.","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes. I'd like to just -- and then our call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of the number of people. We think about the productivity of the people. So the number of calls that they are able to take because you may have more people because of more volume, but that's good, healthy volume with top line growth. But we're always making sure that the people in our call centers and the overall productivity of the call center is increasing.","James Dimon","Yes. And with all the cyber stuff you read about, our fraud in cards and consumers come down, not gone up because of some of these deployed technologies in call centers. I would take you through all of them, but then we're telling them bad guys our secrets. But there are a lot of ways to stop some of the bad guys now.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","I'll start off with sort of a broader question on just the macro outlook. I think, Jen, you mentioned you feel the economy -- the U.S. economy is on sound footing, the consumer is obviously strong, but we are seeing some softening in the economic data. What are you hearing from clients? What are they telling you about whether they're concerned or whether there's increasing concern on policy, macro uncertainties? And how you're thinking about that going forward?","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure. So on client sentiment, I think it's fair to say that perhaps the marginal investment is being impacted by trade fatigue in terms of the uncertainty. But broadly speaking, while it's slower growth, it's still growth. As I said, the U.S. consumer is incredibly strong. Consumer spending is strong. Sentiment is strong, so the consumer credit is good. And it is true that if you look at the ISM surveys, both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, they were recently disappointing. So I would say, no doubt, cautionary signs, but credit remains very good, and there's still very healthy business activity.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Great. That's helpful. On NII, just going back to NII, specifically in the CCB, if you adjust for the $350 million, actually, grew sequentially, which was a pretty strong result. And I know guidance is at the consolidated level. But how do we think about the glide path in that business going forward and some of the puts and takes? Deposit pricing came in a little bit at the consolidated level. I suspect some of that is commercial. But how do we think about that business and the NII trajectory? And is it possible that you can continue to grow that?","Jennifer Piepszak","So I mean there's no doubt that the business will be impacted by rate headwinds, as the implieds play out. We're not immune to that. But as I said earlier, there is at least a partial offset to that in growth. And so we still feel very good about the underlying growth that we're seeing there. And then just in terms of reprice, obviously, there's very little movement on the back of the SEBIs, given there's very little movement on the way up. And in fact, quarter-over-quarter, we saw rates paid in the consumer businesses tick up a little bit on slight migration that we continue to see into interest-bearing. But we love the platform. The branch expansion is going very, very well. And so we feel great about the continued growth there, but we won't be immune to rate headwinds.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys give us some additional color on the Investment Banking backlog that you may have at the end of the third quarter? And then second, if you take a look at the success that you had Investment Banking grabbing more wallet share, is it coming here in North America or in Asia? Can you give us some color there as well?","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure. So on the IB pipeline, I would say it's healthy, although we do expect to be down in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year, on very strong performances in the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year. But overall, it feels healthy. And I would say, geographically, largely some strength in the U.S.","Gerard Cassidy","And then following up in the Markets business, again, you had good numbers. How important is the technology spending that you've been doing in Markets leading to grabbing more wallet share in both equity and FICC?","James Dimon","I think it's critical. If you walk on the trading floor today, the deployment of technology in automated trading algorithms in swaps and FX and equities, it's making its way into corporate buying. But I think it's critical you keep up with the technology in a very competitive business where market share matters.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Compton of MorningStar.","Eric Compton","So I just want to step back and real big picture here. I mean net interest income, you're already starting to see some pressure there. Just I think the general commentary in the industry is the banks are just under pressure seemingly almost everywhere. You got to focus on expenses. And yet, you guys are still hitting returns on tangible at 18%. ","So just stepping back, I mean, you still have a couple of billion to play with before you even start getting to that 17% long-term goal level. Like what worries you about potentially pushing you under that 17% level? It just seems like even with all the pressures in the industry, you're still even exceeding it. Other than onetime credit events really -- I guess stepping back, what worries you about pushing the bank to that or even below that from your perspective?","James Dimon","And again, I think that you're overdoing the pressures on the banking industry. Okay. Because we've had growth in the United States for the better part of 10 years. And I'd say that the credit is extraordinarily good. So if you look at consumer credit, commercial credit, wholesale, it's extraordinarily good. It can only get worse if you have a cycle. So our 17% is -- we always sort of play just through the cycle. We are at the over-earning part of the cycle in credit today. At one point, we'll be at the under-earning part on credit. And of course, if you have a recession, it affects volumes and all these sort of things. So that's right -- that 17% is through the cycle and, frankly, not that bad.","Operator","Our next question is from Marlin Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","I wanted to ask you two kind of different venues of questions. First, is if you look at the balance sheet, security yields came down pretty significantly this quarter. Just wondered how much you had in premium amortization that was embedded in that. And then as you look at the interest-bearing deposit cost, we didn't get much traction on the first cut. But did you get a little bit more traction on lowering those rates as you went into the -- going into the fourth quarter?","Jennifer Piepszak","Okay. Sure. So first, on securities yield. So that did play a role, Marty. But more importantly, the impact on securities yields came from mix and just lower rates overall. So predominantly, mix and lower rates, and then to a lesser extent, your point on prepaid as well as a little bit of day counts. And then on betas, broadly speaking, we'd say betas are symmetric. And so if you look at the retail side, as I said before, very little movement on SEBI. And we did see rates paid even tick up a little bit there quarter-on-quarter. Wholesale, there's obviously more opportunity to reprice, but we do that client by client. And we're not going to lose valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta. And so what we saw there, as you might expect, in CIB, rates paid down quarter-over-quarter. And then we also saw rates pay down in both AWM and the Commercial Bank, but a little bit less so.","Marlin Mosby","And then would you see retail improving next quarter? And then Jamie, I wanted to talk to you about liquidity. Two things. One, we saw the repo market. And as you looked at Volcker and the liquidity coverage ratios, you've kind of taken the big banks out of participating and being able to solve for some of those liquidity issues. So the Fed has kind of put a ring-fence around this, putting that all on their shoulders versus letting JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs or Bank of America jump in and help in those processes. And then when you sold the loans this quarter, those mortgage loans, and replaced them with securities, was that related to liquidity or just the decisioning process on that?","James Dimon","So the loan decision is because we are at standardized capital now, which I think, by the way, risk -- I mean the advance is far more important, and we should probably report more than that because that's 13%. But when we're constrained by standardized, there are points in time when putting mortgage on your balance sheet just gives you a very low return. And of course, you have a portfolio decision. You can sell it or put it in your balance sheet. If you sell it, you're going to probably reinvest in securities. So it's a pure economic calculation of what gives you a better return. And that's why, I think we need some fixes in the mortgage market about securitizations. Because I think we've pointed out, if you had built the securitizations, you have a healthy mortgage market, you keep some on them on your balance sheet. You sell some of the risk. And you wouldn't have to sell these mortgages per se. ","And I do think -- and the liquidity, we've focused on liquidity at the Fed account. We have 400 -- probably total $450 billion of cash, T-bills, repo, deposit at the Fed, and there's all -- a bunch of certain constraints. And you want to base a proper liquidity. But then I should also point out that those things go into getting multiple GSIB calculations, multiple other calculations. So you kind of calibrate, of course, all those things and optimize across all those things. But I do think you're correct. The banks are deploying now but they will not be able to redeploy a big chunk of that $500 billion that we have in all the markets when the time comes. It's not Volcker per se. Volcker is a slightly different thing.","Jennifer Piepszak","And then, Marty, I think you asked about fourth quarter. We do think we'll continue to see deposit margin compression there on the retail side. We have come off the peaks in terms of CD pricing, but you still have slight migration there into interest-bearing products.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Jen, you had mentioned earlier just the point about that next year's earning asset growth will be led largely through deposits. But with all this mixing into your last point there about where the deposit margin pressure comes in, do you expect the constitution of deposit growth to change at all, whether it comes from the consumer business, wholesale or the Wealth Management complex?","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure. Look, I think it's difficult to know. I think, in a declining rate environment, as I said, I think the higher-yielding alternatives are obviously less attractive for consumers. We do still see good organic growth in wholesale as well in both Treasury Services and Securities Services. So I think it's difficult to know. The macro environment will be a big determinant.","Kenneth Usdin","Got it. Understood. And the second question, the card revenue margin you mentioned, it's kind of flattened out. And I'm just wondering, can you first walk us through the NII versus fee components there? Any -- is it partially because of that obvious NII challenge? Is there also any changes with regards to just the underlying card fee activity?","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes. There is really just timing. There's just seasonality there. So at Investor Day, we said that the card revenue rate would be 11 50%, plus or minus. But fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for us, and so we still expect to hit that 11 50%, plus or minus, for the full year guidance, so just seasonality.","James Dimon","And the thing I'd add here, it doesn't have the same compression that it does in deposits.","Jennifer Piepszak","Yes. Very different dynamic there.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","Just I just want to follow up on -- you talked about the fourth quarter net interest come just under $14 billion, and that's not a bad place to start for next year. You highlighted balance sheet growth and mix and had some puts and takes. But it's probably not as bad as I think some would have thought. Think about that $14 billion-ish as potential run rate plus or minus. I'm just to trying to better understand like what's the rate assumption that you have. And how much of a swing factor is the duration change that you did in the third quarter helping that?","Jennifer Piepszak","So I mean we're doing that based on the latest implieds. And it's obviously early days. We're working through our budget process as we speak. So it's based on the latest implieds, which have a cut in October and a cut in April. And 10-year, call it, 1.70% plus or minus. So relative to where we might have been just a couple of months ago, or even weeks ago, it might have been a different outlook. So I think it's important to take it with a health warning that's on the latest implied because that is, of course, what we know.","James Dimon","And it's assuming some balance sheet growth, as opposed to all things being equal. That would be worse.","Jennifer Piepszak","That's right. It would be worse. The balance sheet growth, that will partial offset to larger impacts from just rates.","Matthew O'Connor","And what is the rate sensitivity at this point? And how is that split between the short and long end?","Jennifer Piepszak","There, I would just say you can look at the earnings at risk that we'll have in the Q. I mean that's probably the best way to think about it. Because that is not an NII sensitivity, but is an interest rate sensitivity. And so that will be out in a few weeks.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.","Michael Mayo","But Jamie, this is the first earnings call we\u2019ve had since the Business Roundtable came up with a new statement that it's not about shareholder-driven capitalism, it's about stakeholder-driven capitalism. And I was hanging out at the New Yorker Festival over the weekend and your name came up, and at least one author said he spoke to you. And the real question, what is the political and regulatory risk to JPMorgan to earnings as we look out over a year? You're having the presidential debates. Over the weekend, people talked about -- and the politicians talked about the wealth tax, the transaction tax, the change in corporate tax, personal tax, basically flattening the pyramid. And it seems like a lot of people point their fingers at the banks, including JPMorgan. So my question to you is what are you doing...","James Dimon","They're pointing their fingers as base on what? Point their fingers as a base for what?","Michael Mayo","I think part of the cause, part of the cause of inequality in America. Banks should be doing more to help out the situation. And again, it's a whole -- this is just one example, Mike. The way I saw this at the New Yorker Festival, this was kind of intellectual underpinnings of a lot of the policies that are being introduced today. And so you're seeing that in the politicians' statements about wealth tax, changes to the bank business model, too much deregulation. And it's just an environment -- I mean here we are 10 years after the financial crisis, where I would summarize it as very anti-bank. And I know JPMorgan had proposals to help move the company and the country ahead. But how do you, as head of the Business Roundtable, help the industry and corporate America manage these concerns about income inequalities and these other topics that come up in the presidential debates. I know it's a big question. But hey, you're in that role as -- with the Business Roundtable.","James Dimon","Okay. So the Business Roundtable, checking -- get rid of shareholder value, basically said shareholder value and customers and employees and communities, which essentially has been how many of these banks been running for years. I think part of the statement was a lot of the world looked at shareholder value and it -- that you have rapacious profit seeking. Whereas most CEOs are thinking pretty long term, building people, taking care of their employees, their customers. And we can highlight all the great things we do for employees: huge training, health, wellness, retirement, sharing the wealth inside the company. And we do, do all that. And most of these companies do that. A lot of these larger companies, they're great community citizens when it comes to trying to participate and help and stuff like that. So I do think -- and so as a JPMorgan matter, we're going to grow our businesses and serve our clients as best we can whatever the environment is. ","That environment changes. Politically, it changes. Economically it changes, geopolitically. But we're just going to navigate to do the best we can, serving our clients the best we can. And I do think that we try -- and I'm speaking for a lot of -- to try to do a tremendous amount to help the communities because there have been people left behind. The inner city schools are not failing because of banks, okay? And infrastructure is not failing because of banks. So I think we can help build infrastructure, help train people, get more skills, get involved with education systems and like all the kind of stuff that a lot of us all do in Detroit, we could lift up society. And I think it's good for us to lift up society. And when society does better, everyone does better. ","If you don't believe me, look at Venezuela, Argentina, Cuba, North Korea, et cetera, that doing well is a good thing for society, and we can share the wealth a little bit. So I'm not going to respond to specific political statements out there, but we'll do our part to be a great community citizen and serve our shareholders at the same time.","Michael Mayo","So can I put words in your mouth? I mean doing well for communities and employees and all the other stakeholders is good for the shareholders long term. Is that...","James Dimon","Yes. And Mike, I actually gave examples in the crisis about the amount of people that we financed at markets way -- prices way below the market. We're doing that to make rapacious profit seeking? No. And that included states, cities, hospitals, businesses, consumers et cetera. And so you won't be \u2013 but our attitude was not going to help our clients get through this tough time. It wasn't about our profitability. Our profitability dropped dramatically, and we were fine. And I think that was a long-term thinking, but you can never get sued over that. So -- and same time we do with employees. We're constantly investing in employees and branches, in jobs and training. That stuff will benefit 3 years out, 5 years out, 10 years out, 20 years out.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Quick question on equity trading. I know you gave an update on where you thought the revenues would come in, in mid-September. Looks like it came in worse than what you were looking for. Is there a way to kind of break out what was the impact of the potential marks on investments versus true equity trading revenues?","Jennifer Piepszak","Sure. In equity derivatives, it was a combination of weaker client activity and some losses on inventory, but it wasn't meaningful. Those losses were certainly not meaningful in the grand scheme of things, but they were part of the equity derivatives story.","Brian Kleinhanzl","But there wasn't any other additional investments in there that had marks on them impacting the numbers?","Jennifer Piepszak","No.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then separately on CECL. I know you've been doing parallel runs, as all banks have been. Are you at the point now where you can kind of give what the pro forma provision will be for CECL? Or do you plan on doing that prior to the adoption date?","Jennifer Piepszak","Well, as we said at Investor Day, the range is $4 billion to $6 billion. We've done a ton of work, as you say, and a lot of modeling. The range is still between $4 billion and $6 billion. And we'll be able to be more precise, obviously, as we prepare for the January 1 implementation.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","One follow-up on the equity. I mean I know DB books were in the market, and I believe that you were a winner of some of that. Is that in these numbers in 3Q or that comes in, in 4Q?","James Dimon","There was some fine balance I think you're referring to. I don't know the answer to that.","Jennifer Piepszak","It was not meaningful whatever it is.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. All right. And then separately, there's been some news obviously on discount brokers cutting commissions to 0. I know you have You Invest and that that's a recent launch. But how do you think about how that impacts your business model? Is that just something that you would consider is specific to You Invest? Or do you think that that's something that would have a bigger impact and potentially more optionality for your clients across your wealth spectrum?","Jennifer Piepszak","So majority of our customers in You Invest already trade for free, and so we're pleased to see the market moving toward us. As we think about You Invest, it is one component of our broader investment strategy. And as I said, we're really proud of this quarter's results with client investment assets being up 13%. It was an important product launch for us in terms of meeting an unmet need with our existing customers, but we're pleased to see the market moving toward us.","James Dimon","Yes. And there's strength in You Invest. We still are improving the products over time. We haven't done a tremendous amount of marketing. Kind of want to get it all right both You Invest and You Invest Portfolios, and then we'll figure out all the exact specific pricing around it.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Jennifer Piepszak","Thank you.","James Dimon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's call.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $4.2 billion, EPS of $1.07 and a return on tangible common equity of 8% on revenue of $25.5 billion. The impact of the U.S. tax reform is the one significant item we have this quarter. We reported a $2.4 billion reduction to our fourth quarter net income. Excluding this, our performance would have been $6.7 billion of net income, EPS of $1.76 per share with an ROTCE of 13%. ","Similar to the last few quarters, our underlying results were quite strong in the fourth quarter, and highlights included, average core loan growth of 6% year-on-year, bringing us to 8% for the full year; and credit performance continued to be very strong; a good holiday season fueled double-digit growth in Card sales and merchant volumes, each up 13%; our client investment assets were up 17%; we maintained our number one rank in global IBCs and we grew share; and we had record net income and revenue in the Commercial Bank and record revenue and AUM in Asset & Wealth Management. ","Before I go into our results, let's spend time on tax reform on Page 2. The $2.4 billion impact of tax reform was largely driven by a deemed repatriation of our unremitted overseas earnings as well as an adjustment to the value of our tax-oriented investments, including affordable housing and energy. These were partially offset by a benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability. The impact is primarily in Corporate, but as you can see, there was some impact to each of the CIB and the Commercial Bank. ","The capital impact is $1.2 billion higher at $3.6 billion or about 25 basis points of CET1. And our effective tax rate will be approximately 19% this year and 20% over the near term, think through 2020, after which, it should start to gradually increase as certain business credits are phased out over time. ","While there is now enacted bill, and with that, there's more clarity, there are still a number of open implementation as well as accounting questions that will require clarification. And as such, our estimated impact may be refined in future quarters. That said, I know there are a number of important questions which I'll try and get you clarity on. ","First, with respect to the deemed repatriations, the operative word for us is deemed. In many ways, you can think of our unremitted overseas earnings as the equivalent of bricks and mortar being required in order to meet local jurisdictional capital and liquidity requirements. So we do not expect to actually remit anything significant. ","Second, although the reduction in the corporate tax rate was 14%, you can see that the reduction in our effective tax rate is only about 10%, given the impact of the geographic mix of our taxable income, the disallowance of FDIC fees and smaller benefits associated with tax-exempt income and other deductions as a result of the lower absolute rate. ","Moving on to the BEAT tax, this is an area where there do remain open questions. However, at this point, we do not expect to have a BEAT liability. But if we are wrong, we would not expect it to be material. ","Next, the question of whether the benefit will be competed away, and if so, over what time line. Pricing strategy will differ across products. It is true that we operate in competitive and transparent markets, and this means that ultimately, you could expect some of the benefit for the industry will be passed through to our customers over time. ","Competition is one key driver, but there are other factors, such as scale, expertise, the breadth of your products and services and the investments that you're making in customer experience, and these matter a lot. And for certain of our businesses, pricing is not necessarily directly or immediately driven by fluctuations in the cost of capital, think flow markets. And remember, we didn't get to price up the changes in market structure and capital and liquidity over the last several years. So it will be nuanced, it will be different across products, and time is a very important dimension. Any competitive dynamic will play out over time. ","We are in the process of putting together a cohesive and comprehensive set of long-term and sustainable actions for our employees, for customers and communities in part in response to tax reform. Some of our plans may involve subsidies for lower-income borrowers and support for small businesses. And for these customers and for some others, they may feel a benefit sooner. ","With respect to our capital plan, there are no immediate changes to note. This won't change our overall strategy, and remember, the first half of 2018 is governed by last year's CCAR. ","Finally, on the potential impact to our businesses, the modernization of the U.S. tax code is a significant step forward for the country and a big win for the economy. And we include an estimated 20 to 30 basis points of growth in the U.S. this year and next. However, clients are still digesting the tax bill, and much like this rate cycle, we haven't seen this movie before. We'll have to watch it play out. There will be pluses and minuses by client and pluses and minuses across the products. ","So overall, stepping back, tax reform is a positive. And for our clients, there's more certainty, more clarity, and that should give them confidence to act. ","Moving now to Page 3, let's get into some details on the fourth quarter results. Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $1.1 billion or 5% year-on-year as net interest income was up $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower NII in Markets. Loan interest revenue was down modestly as growth in Auto as well as Asset & Wealth Management partially made up for lower Market performance. Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 9% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth including Auto lease depreciation. ","In the fourth quarter, we took an impairment charge of a little over $100 million related to certain leased asset in the Commercial Bank. And we increased our contribution to the foundation, adding $200 million this quarter. ","Credit cost of $1.3 billion were up about $450 million year-on-year. Charge-offs were flat, with an increase in Card being offset by continued decreases across other portfolios. And although net reserve builds this quarter were modest, we saw releases in the fourth quarter of last year of approximately $400 million.","Shifting to the full year on Page 4. We reported net income for the year of $24.4 billion, a return on tangible common equity of 12% and EPS of $6.31. Adjusting for the two front-page significant items that we had this year, being tax reform this quarter and the benefit of the WaMu settlement in the second quarter, our net income would've been another record of $26.5 billion with an ROTCE of 13% and EPS of $6.87. ","Revenue crossed back over the $100 billion threshold this year which feels good, $104 billion, up 5%, $4.1 billion of which was higher net interest income in line with guidance, benefiting from higher rates and growth, relatively modest deposit repricing, but pressured by lower Market NII. Noninterest revenue was up $400 million with higher Auto lease income as well as higher fees across the Investment Bank; Asset, Wealth Management; and Consumer, adding $2.6 billion to revenues and more than compensating for headwinds in Home Lending on a smaller market, investments in Card and lower Markets. ","We ended the year with adjusted expense of $58.5 billion, but as you can see, we made a total contribution to our foundation this year of $350 million in part in anticipation of tax reform. This brings our adjusted overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise. Credit cost for the year were $5.3 billion, down 1% as the environment remains benign. ","Moving on to Page 5, balance sheet and capital. We ended the year with CET1 of 12.1%, down almost 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, about 25 basis points of which related to tax adjustments, and the remainder, loan growth. All the other ratios as well as tangible book value per share also reflected a combination of $6.7 billion of capital distributions and the $3.6 billion impact of tax reform. ","Moving on to Page 6 on Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 19%. We continued to grow core loans, up 8% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending, up 13%; and Business Banking, Card and Auto loans and leases were each up 6%. Consumer deposit growth was strong, up 7%, and we believe we are maintaining our sizable lead over the market despite an industry-wide slowdown, given rising rates. ","Card sales and merchant processing volumes were each up 13%, driven by continued strength from Card new products as well as ongoing momentum in Merchant Services. In December, we completed the acquisition of WePay, which marks a big step for us into the integrated payment space, allowing us to efficiently provide software-enabled payments to small business clients. And we also completed the renegotiation with Marriott for our co-branded cards, which will make us the largest issuer of the largest co-branded hotel program in the world. For all intents and purposes, we've now finished the renewals of our cobranded card deals. ","Revenue of $12.1 billion was up 10% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 16% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was down 15% on lower net servicing revenue driven by MSR as well as loan spread compression. Our originations were down 16% and the Markets down an estimated 25%. And we gained share, a trend we expect to continue, given our investments. And Card, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 11% year-on-year on higher Auto lease income, growth in Card loan balances and margins and lower net acquisition costs. ","For the full year, Card revenue rate was 10.6%, in line with our guidance, and we still expect to reach 11.25% in the first half of this year. Expense of $6.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher Auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth. The overhead ratio was 55% for the quarter, 56% for the year as the business moved past the impact of investments and started generating positive operating leverage in the second half of '17. ","Finally, on credit. Card charge-offs came in line with guidance for the year at 2.95%. The increase in Card charge-offs was predominantly offset by preceding credit performance across other portfolios. ","In terms of credit reserve, the net $15 million build this quarter was driven by a $200 million build in Card on growth, offset by releases in Home Lending of $150 million and Auto of $35 million. And as I noted last quarter, Auto trends have stabilized and the industry feels to be on solid footing. ","Now turning to Page 7 in the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.3 billion on revenue of $7.5 billion and an ROE of 12%. But revenue was impacted by 2 noteworthy items this quarter, and both of them had an impact in Markets, so I'll start with Markets. ","Total Markets revenue was $3.4 billion, down 26% year-on-year. However, Fixed Income Markets included the net impact of tax reform on our tax-oriented investments which was approximately $260 million, accounting for 6% of the year-on-year Markets decline. Additionally, Equity Markets included a notable loss of $143 million on a single margin loan. This accounted for 3% of the year-on-year decline. It's worth noting that the loss appears here in Markets as we elected fair value option on this loan. However, when you do industry comparisons, be aware that others involved in this facility may not have made that same election and may have all of their losses in credit. So in addition, although not in Markets revenues, $130 million of credit cost this quarter was driven by a reserve build related to that same name. ","So adjusting for those items, our Markets revenue would have been down 17% year-on-year, which is much closer to the experience up to the beginning of December, when we last spoke publicly. ","Fixed income revenue was down 27% adjusted, principally driven by a tough prior year comparison and low volatility and tight credit spreads which have continued into this quarter. Equities revenue was up 12% adjusted against the record fourth quarter of '16. And similar to the past few quarters, the driver of the increase was continued tailwinds from investments in cash, prime and corporate derivatives. ","Moving on to banking. We had a record year for total fees and for debt underwriting fees. We maintained our number one rank in global IBCs while growing share and we also ranked number one in North America and EMEA. This quarter, IB revenue was $1.6 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by broad strength across capital markets. ","Advisory fees were up 2% as we saw good momentum with some large deals closing. We ranked number two for the year in wallet, gaining share. And we completed more deals than any other bank. ","Equity underwriting fees were up 14%, with indices up across every region and several at or near all-time highs. We maintained leadership positions in wallet and volumes across every product globally this year. And while we ended up number two in wallet, the distance to number one was only a few basis points. ","And debt underwriting fees were up 12% as the market remained receptive to new issuance across high-grade and leveraged finance and refinancing activity was strong. We maintained our number one rank. We gained share, and this year, booked around the most number of deals in the firm's history. The overall pipeline remains healthy and at levels similar to last year. Our balance sheets are strong and market conditions favorable. ","Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 13%. In addition to higher rates, we continued to see organic growth within the business as the investments we've made over the past several years have improved our clients' experience across the platform. ","Security Services revenues of $1 billion was up 14%, driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 12% year-on-year, and higher asset-based fees on record AUC, given higher market levels globally. ","Finally, expense of $4.5 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by the relative timing of compensation accruals. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter was 27%; for the year, 28%, broadly in line with prior year. ","Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 8. I was another outstanding quarter for the Commercial Bank, with record net income of $957 million, record revenue of $2.4 billion and an ROE of 18%. And for the year, net income and revenue were also records. The business is firing on all cylinders and delivered an ROE of 17%. ","For the quarter, revenue included a benefit of a little over $100 million associated with tax reform and in our Community Development Banking business. Even without this benefit, revenue would still be a record, up 14% year-on-year, on higher NII from higher rates as well as deposit and loan growth across businesses. ","IB revenue of $587 million was down 3% year-on-year, but still a strong performance. For the full year, we saw record IB revenue of $2.3 billion, up 2%, with particular strength in middle market, which was up over 50%, compensating for a smaller number of large deals. The pipeline and momentum into the first quarter feels good. ","Expense of $912 million included an impairment charge, also, of a little over $100 million on certain leased equipment which we expect to sell in the first half of this year. Excluding this, we saw got expense growth of 9% as we executed on our technology and product investments. And this year, we added net 120 new bankers in the business and entered six new markets, giving us a presence in all top 50 MSAs. ","Loan balances were up 7% year-on-year, 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 6% year-on-year, driven by continued strength in expansion market and specialized industries. While sequential growth was up a more modest 1%, we are seeing decent deal flow and pipelines are holding steady. Client sentiment continues to be strong, supported by corporate tax reform. ","CRE saw growth of 9% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, in line with the industry. Multifamily lending continued to see tightened pricing on elevated competition. We remain appropriately focused on client selection, given where we are in the cycle and with particular caution around construction lending. ","Finally, credit remains among the best we've seen. This quarter, we saw a benefit of $62 million, largely driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas portfolio. And net charge-offs were four basis points. ","Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset, Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $654 million with a pretax margin of 30% and an ROE of 28%. Revenue was a record $3.4 billion this quarter, driven by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposits and loans. For the full year, net income and revenue were records with a pretax margin of 28% and an ROE of 25%. Expense for the quarter of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by a combination of higher compensation as well as a gross up for external fees which is offset in revenue. ","For the quarter, we saw long-term net inflows of $30 billion with positive flows across all asset classes on continued strong long-term performance. For the full year, we had long-term net inflows of $68 billion, driven predominantly by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. ","Record AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 15% and 14%, respectively, year-on-year, reflecting higher market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 10% year-on-year, down 2% sequentially, reflecting continued migration into investment-related assets, the vast majority of which we are retaining. And new client flows remain healthy. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 11% year-on-year; including mortgage, up 14%. ","Moving to Page 10 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $2.3 billion, which includes $2.7 billion of the tax reform adjustment. Treasury & CIO's results improved year-on-year, primarily due to the benefit of higher rates. ","So finally turning to Page 11 and the outlook. Before I get to specifics, remember, we do have Investor Day coming up in February, so we will be giving you a lot more guidance there. So that leaves me with two structural things to talk about, the first, staying on the theme of tax reform. And lower corporate tax rate in 2018 will have the effect of reducing the tax equivalent adjustments or gross ups in our managed revenues. On a run rate basis, that reduction for the full year will be about $1.2 billion, and more than half of that is in the NII. ","Secondly, effective January 1, 2018, a new revenue recognition accounting rule came into effect, which requires certain expenses to be grossed up that were previously recognized as contra expense -- contra revenue. We estimate, for the full year, the impact will increase both revenues and expenses for the firm by another $1.2 billion, the vast majority of which will be in Asset, Wealth Management with a small amount in the CIB. ","So for guidance, expect the first quarter NII will be down modestly quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a combination of the lower gross ups I mentioned as well as normal day count which offset the benefits of higher rates and growth. And we estimate the first quarter effective tax rate will be about 17%, reflecting seasonality of stock comp adjustments. ","So to wrap up, the end of 2017 was constructive, characterized by strong equity markets; higher interest rates; good economic data globally; decent client activity; high levels of confidence; and, obviously, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Against that backdrop, our underlying financial performance in the fourth quarter and 2017 was strong, benefiting from diversification and scale and consistently delivering for our customers and communities, gaining share across our businesses. ","Adjusting for significant items in the year, net income and EPS would have been clear records, driving a healthy 13% return on tangible common equity. We're excited about the landscape and the opportunities for our clients in 2018. We will be there for them, and the company is poised to continue to perform. ","With that, operator, I will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","So I do expect you to defer either the response to February 27th, Marianne, but I just had to ask the question. The revenue outlook seems to be quite strong for the banking industry generally in 2018, and many investors were wondering, is the 55% overhead ratio a long-term target for JPMorgan, regardless of the revenue environment? Or could that potentially be better over the short term as we get a boost in the economy from the Tax Act?","Marianne Lake","So I mean, you are right. that's probably more of an Investor Day discussion. But what I would tell you is that when we have given that as our sort of medium-term guidance, in our simulation, we kind of imagined an environment that was more normalized in lots of ways. So we anticipated higher -- more normal interest rates, we anticipated the continuation of somewhat benign credit and we anticipated continuing to invest in the businesses. And you've seen us do it in 2017, and we would expect to do it and more in '18. So certainly, there could be years when we would be below it, and there have been years when we were above it, but I think it's still a decent place for us to be aiming for in the near term.","Erika Najarian","And my follow-up question to that is a lot of investors are excited about the prospect of stronger economic activity in 2018 leading to greater markets activity and greater lending activity. And if you look back into the 1980s, at least for loan growth, loan growth actually stepped down in 1987. And I'm wondering if you could share your insights on how you think those activity trends will shape up in 2018.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I know that everybody is eagerly awaiting there to be direct and noticeable impacts of tax reform, but we're only a couple of weeks into the year. And so our expectation, as I said before, just really stepping back, is that there it will boost growth in the economy. People have different points of view. Our research team is saying by up to 30 basis points in each of the next two years. But know it could be better than that. We do know that there will be puts and takes across our businesses, but in general, we would expect that the sort of certainty that people have been waiting for, coupled with the confidence that we know they've had, and the need for people to try and deliver growth to their shareholders, should mean that things that they were going to do become more compelling and they might be willing to do more. So I think you'll see the capital markets space potentially react more quickly and I think loan growth may have a bit of a lag, but never say never. ","So we just need to, I think, be a little patient to see some of that play out. But sentiment is strong. Cash positions will be improved, profitability will be higher, things that were rich before will be more fairly valued now. And so I think it should be all very constructive. And certainly, we would take the upside, and we support our clients.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Maybe a question on NII, just I want to make sure I understand the moving parts. So if I think about your guidance for the first quarter of down slightly. You have two less days in the quarter, that's maybe almost $300 million sequentially. And then half of the impact from the Tax Act in terms of tax equivalent adjustments is going to be felt in NIIs, that's sort of linear and equal, so that's another $150 million. So if I do the math, is it about a $400 million sort of apples-to-apples benefit from higher rates that you've seen? Is that the way to think about it?","Marianne Lake","It's a good model with just one clarification. So yes, a little more than half of the gross-up adjustment is NII. Yes, it is broadly linear for the sake of argument. So $150 million is not a bad estimate, it's actually more like $160 million, but pretty close. The day count is actually not worth $300 million, it's worth a little bit less than $200 million. So you've got a sort of headwind, for want of a better word, of call it $300 million and change. And then we would have had a combination of the impact of the December hike, with obviously each hike, the impact is less, some growth and other puts and takes. So call it $350 million of a headwind offsetting growth, and the rate hike.","James Mitchell","Right. And just to follow up on -- it seemed like deposit betas actually slowed this quarter. And what do -- you're expecting that to sort of reaccelerate this year. How do we think about, I guess, beyond 1Q in the benefits of rates?","Marianne Lake","So I would say about deposit betas, at this point, you really do have to think about it in a sort of bifurcated way. So firstly, I would say that the cumulative beta we've experienced, and I wouldn't say we've seen it slow down, but it's remained discipline generally. What we've seen so far in the rate cycle is very similar to what we saw in previous rate cycles. So it's not like we learned stunning new news from which we can extrapolate and make changes to our expectations. So we have no real change in the long-term expectations to reprice. And it really is a bit point -- bifurcated. So retail, checking and core savings, there have been little to no movement in the industry. Again, given the absolute level of rates, that would be in line with our expectations. And on the wholesale space, we're definitely in reprice territory. It is accelerating with every hike and it's different across the spectrum. So obviously, more significant in the sort of TS, Securities Services space. So -- but my expectation, just given where we are in the absolute level of rates is that on the retail space, we would still see a lot of discipline in the market in 2018. But ultimately, we haven't changed our expectations that whatever that time line looks like, we're going to get to an overall reprice of above 50%, but we'll have to see.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Sorry, I was on mute. It feels like we have a once in a lifetime, or at least in my lifetime, benefit to earnings with this tax change. And we've got a lot of PMs asking the question how our management's going to use that. I saw your comment in the deck that competitive over time, compete away, blah, blah, blah. But I wonder if you could help give us some insight as to how, at a management level, you're thinking about strategically using this benefit that you're getting in the various buckets of reinvest in tech, reinvest in people, reinvest in clients. Do you feel like it's equal across those? Or is there a skew that you're thinking about to take advantage of this? Because how managements use this benefit is going to be critical for stock performance over the next 2 to 3 years.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I mean, I'll give you a framework to think about it, if it's helpful. And you can certainly ask a follow-up question. But you are very familiar with the way that we think about sort of our strategy over time and our investment strategy in particular. And investing in our businesses for growth and profitability has always been first and foremost in our minds. And to be honest, we've talked to you before about the fact that we don't constrain ourselves because we have budgetary targets on those activities if we think we can execute well and we see great opportunity. So expect that the first thing that we would do is to continue to lean into the investment opportunities we have writ large. So that's bankers, that's offices, that's global expansion to the degree that that's on the cards. It's digital capabilities, copayments capabilities. It's across all of our businesses. And we've been working even before tax reform on identifying where those opportunities are, and we want to lean into that.","And Jamie said it earlier, we are really pleased that there are some immediate responses for employee benefits. And we will be doing that plus more across our stakeholder constituents. And there will be more to come on that over the next few weeks. And we want to focus on that being, like, comprehensive and sustainable. So we're really trying to be thoughtful about the things that will matter to our employees and to our customers. And then to the degree that we end up still with earnings that were otherwise above plan, then our normal capital strategy comes into play. We've been clear. We think that we are adequately capitalized, that we should expect to have the capital ratio move down slowly over time. And our strategy on potentially continuing to see dividend increases and having repurchase programs that allow us to achieve our target ratio, that hasn't changed. It just might be a bigger dollar number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Just to move to, I guess, a business question. A couple of things just on the Card business. Just looked like credit continues to be pretty good. You did build the reserve for growth, as you mentioned. But noticed that the Card revenue rate was also still a little bit down. Can you just talk a little bit about your outlook for that Card business as you look forward?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I'll just deal with the Card revenue rate real quick because I think we sort of gave a little bit of this in the third quarter, that given the Sapphire Reserve product and given the extraordinary success we had with that in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is an annual travel credit renewal that took place in the fourth quarter, which we already told you, which you would expect to see the revenue rate go down. It was contemplated, and which is why our full year revenue rate of 10.6% was in line with our guidance. And as we lap the acquisition costs and reward costs associated with acquiring all of those Sapphire Reserve customers, and for that matter, our other new products, we're going to see that revenue rate get to the 11.25%, if not in the first quarter, in the first half of next year. And you're going to stabilize out at or above that level.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. And just that's great to hear, that impact. And then just consumer credit, broadly speaking, Auto has continued to look a little bit better and Card's still within reasonable expectations. So a lot of the focus on tax has obviously been on the potential for commercial lending to potentially pick up. How are you guys just thinking about how the consumer behaves and what that means for both consumer loan growth and consumer credit?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So again, it's nuanced, so what I expect though, the first question generally that we're getting is the impact on the housing market given certain specific changes in the tax code. I would say that overall, net-net, we would expect there to be not a significant impact on the housing market and demand nationally, although it could differ by state. So we feel like that's going to hold up nicely. And then you're right. Whether you're talking about consumers or whether you're talking about small businesses, think about the small business environment, this was quite positive for them, so they're going to see higher profitability, higher free cash flow, and to all intents and purposes, the equivalent of an upgrade. So we would be hopeful that, much like the commercial space, that could be the catalyst to see them spend money and hire. And we'll be focusing on that as we think about programs to help. So I think in general, it's going to mean that the already very good credit trends we're seeing will be good for longer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","So first question on fixed income. And I guess the question is if not now, when? I mean, the industry's gone down, had this multi-multi-year degraded in revenues for lots of structural and cyclical reasons. We now have -- we're off QE in the U.S., we're raising rates in the U.S. Europe's doing better. They are still on QE and have low to negative rates, but we might get some changes there. Can you talk about your best guesses in terms of the backdrop for this environment for such an important revenue item?","Marianne Lake","Sure. So Glenn, because I feel like in 2017, we spent so much time talking about year-over-year declines in comparable periods, it's helpful to, I think, that back -- remember the full performance for 2017 for fixed income and for equities and to markets in total. And so acknowledging that the first quarter was quite strong, if you look at the last three quarters, we were talking about reasonably quiet environment, low volatility, historically tight spreads. And yet, those businesses individually and together delivered meaningfully above the cost of capital for us. So maybe not at the sort of outperformance level of 2016, but really good performance. So discipline, scale, optionality, those are the ways we think about fixed income business. And so although I don't -- I'm not going to -- I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you when there will be a catalyst for change. Fixed income is a little on the counter-cyclical side. There will be change. And we're positioned to continue to be able to grow with our clients. So our businesses are doing well. And can't tell you when things will become more volatile. And obviously, that's always an emotional discussion. But it will happen. And when it does, we will be there to serve our clients and to be there for them.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that. Follow-up is on Steinhoff. And I know the -- a, you can't predict fraud. But I'm just curious on that as a business in general, and lots of other banks were involved. But how many other similar types of books are there? And can you talk to the nature of those relationships? Because hindsight's 20\/20, and like, wow, that's a lot of leverage to give somebody on a highly active stock. But it's usually just the customer flow, simple in and out facilitation business. So I wonder if you could just talk about it a little bit more.","Marianne Lake","Yes. I mean, this will garner attention because of the sort of sudden and significant decline. And it is by far and away the largest loss in that business that we've seen since the crisis. And know it will happen from time to time, maybe not this significantly or this suddenly. And remember that because we've got that in fair value, we brought that down, down. So that's not a reserve, that's a mark to market on a publicly traded equity at this point that is significantly down. And so I would say while we are obviously disappointed with the outcome, it's the business we're in. It's a large and diversified business, that even after this loss, it's still very profitable. So it's noteworthy because of its size, its rapidity and it's significant. But it's a profitable business. And without sort of laboring the point, obviously, we go through talking about the potential for there to be rifles and sudden-risk situations. And I've talked a little about that in our governance processes. And sometimes, that will happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of wells Fargo Security.","Michael Mayo","I just wanted to follow up on the tax question. Jamie says on Page 1 of the release that you'll have an accelerated spend for those tax benefits for employees, customers, communities. And I know you kind of answered that, but so how much of that benefit -- I guess you paid $11 billion in taxes last year and that might have been under $7 billion with the lower rate. So if we assume a $4 billion tax benefit, if that's correct, how much of that would be passed on to the employees, customers and communities versus hitting the bottom line? And then the philosophical question, if Jamie's there, if he could answer after you, should that be crucial for stock performance, how much you allow to fall to the bottom line?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So look, I'm not going to give you, like, quantification, but you're not meaningfully wrong about the sort of assessment you made, which it is a big, significant positive and much of it will fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond. And time is an important part to how this plays out. So we want to do really constructive, thoughtful things for all of our constituents, but it won't be the significant portion of that.","James Dimon","Yes. I would just say that we take the $3.5 billion benefit next year. The two major you should in put back of your mind uncertainties, one is the code has to be actually written. And so there'd be a lot of noise going down the road about what that actually means for various industries and stuff like that. And the second area, as spoken by extensively, is competition. Some of it, some will be competed away. So I'm going to -- I'm only telling you because you've got to put it in your mind. I think it's so exuberant that everything, everywhere falls into the bottom line. The second is on our investment. Mary's already spoke that we already are fairly aggressively investing for our future. And in some places, I'm pushing this trade. We can't -- you can only go so fast in hiring new bankers and doing some things, and we may accelerate some of that. ","At Investor Day, we'll be quite clear if we change how we look at that kind of thing. And the other one is what are we going to do special to help the United States of America as realty tax change? And we think we should, We think it's very good the other companies have done it. We think it's time that all of America shared broadly. And we're going to have things that we think are good for some employees. But think of also sustainable growth for communities around the world. And so we're going to give you, in the next couple of weeks, some very thoughtful things that we're going to do. And it may very well bite into some of that $3.5 billion, and so be it. That's what we're supposed to do. We're a bank. We're supposed to help support and grow communities. And it will enhance our growth in the future, too, by the way. So it isn't, like, a giveaway, it's kind of a thoughtful flows to how we should use some of this.","Marianne Lake","And I do want to just -- like, there are two other things, just after what Jamie said, which is if some of this is competed away over time and get to lower cost of credit and lower cost of borrowing and improved pricing to our customers and allows them to grow their businesses and spend more strongly, there is a feedback loop. Similarly, if at the end of the day, it results in some higher dividend or repurchases, that also recycles back into the economy. So it was very optimistic for the performance of this company, which is extraordinarily client-centric. So anything that's good for the economy and our clients will continue to drive long-term profitability for the company. That would to be number one. And number two, not to be defensive, but you guys will appreciate this more than anyone almost, is you can do your own math. But if you add up the cost of controlled market structure reform, capital and liquidity, much of which we're entirely supportive of. But if you add up the impact that had on our returns over the last 5 to 10 years, I mean it, in many ways, dwarfs this. So there will be an element of this that goes back into making sure that the banking system is probably covering the cost of equity, and it should.","Michael Mayo","One follow-up on that feedback loop. So you, Marianne or Jamie, a year from now, do you think that the tax code or other factors will result in an increase in capital markets activity, increase in corporate lending and increase in CapEx, which we've been waiting for all decade?","James Dimon","Yes. Again, I think it's really important to note. People focus very much on what happens tomorrow because of tax reform. I think it's a very good thing. You've seen it with corporations, you've seen it with sentiment, you've seen it with people's plans and things like that. I think it's very good. I think the far more important thing is that 20 years ago, our corporate federal estate rate was 40%, the rest of the world was 40%. Over 20 years, they came down to 20% and we stayed at 40%. Over that time, it's driven brains, capital, you see the reinvested money overseas. One of the accounting firms did a study of 5,000 companies that would have been headquartered here, are either headquarter overseas or owned by a foreign company, which I'm not against, it's a huge number. It's the cumulative effect of retained capital and increasing competitive American companies that will drive jobs and ways in the long run. I have absolutely no question that we will be far better off year after year if you're having done this. And it's just impossible to tell exactly what it means this month or this quarter or something like that.","So we're going to be watching, just like you, and waiting just like you. But I hate guessing about the effect, like, on capital markets. I don't know. The fact is we look at capital -- we have fabulous people in sales and trade, fabulous research, great technology capability. In the last five years, we dealt with Dodd-Frank, MiFID, all these rules and regulations, steps, what are the other ones called in Europe, and we've done okay. I look at it as all a big positive. And we'll still be there buying and selling securities for our clients, issuing securities. And yes. I think if we're right about it in improving American competitive growth in the global economy, it will drive just capital markets activity. Let's just wait and see.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.","John McDonald","Apologies if this is asked. I got cut off for a second. Marianne, was wondering about charge-offs and credit. Things looked good this quarter, for the full year, it came in line with your kind of $5 billion charge-off outlook. Was wondering how you're thinking about the credit environment heading into this year. And if the environment remained strong, do you still have some seasoning that might put some upward pressure on charge-offs, even in a good environment?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I would say if you look across the consumer sector, x Card, the credit performance is, like, really, really good and should continue to be really good in 2018. So 2018 feels like very strong credit performance in Consumer. In Card, we said at Investor Day, that we would expect to continue to see charge-off rates go up, and we are growing loans. So a combination of those things will mean we'll have higher charge-offs and some reserve builds. I will tell you that we're not seeing anything that isn't in line with our expectation. So this is not normalization deterioration, this is seasoning and maturation of the newer vintages and growth. And so if I sort of sent you back to what we talked about earlier in the year, it's probably closer to 3.25%, but in line with our expectations. So we're expecting very much more of the same in the consumer space. And in the wholesale space, credit is really, really good. And some of the places where we had been watching for there to potentially be stress, fundamentals are improved. And we continue to obviously watch retail and to be cautious, given where we are on certain parts of real estate banking. But we're not seeing any fragility right now in our outlook.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Card. You've had some good balance growth. Are you seeing any change in propensity to revolve from your customers? Or is your balance growth coming more from new customers? Or is there any increase in kind of revolve rate?","Marianne Lake","So we actually had been on a pretty significant strategic drive to make sure that we had a deeply, deeply engaged customer base. If you go back precrisis and look at the industry, there was also a balance focus and less engaged customers. So we worked really hard over the course of the last many years to drive engagement, which is why you can see that we have a larger share of spend that we do of outstandings, but we've grown both. So we are getting balances from new customers. We are working on making sure that the right customers are revolving. And we're making progress. So year-on-year, we've gained share in both and we'll continue to focus on revolve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet.","Steven Chubak","Marianne, had a question on the tax guidance that you guys have given. The Slide 2 disclosure's really helpful, but I really wanted to dig into the comment on the BEAT provision. You noted that the ultimate impact for your business shouldn't be material, and at the same time, the guidance from some of your foreign bank competitors, suffice it to say, has been much more measured. And I'm wondering if the impact's not that material for you guys but weighs more heavily on the peer set. Do you actually see a market share consolidation opportunity emerging potentially with -- and in particular within the repo and sec lending sides?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I mean, obviously, the impact is differently situated for the foreign banking set. And I know that there -- as Jamie said, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of implementation and finalization of the actual code itself. So I don't want to guess on how all that will play out. I certainly don't want to guess about the second order impact of potential consolidation.","Steven Chubak","All right. Fair enough. Well, maybe just try one more on tax specifically relating to CCAR. I'm assuming that the test parameters for '18 are broadly consistent with last year, which I think is most people's general expectation. You have the lower starting capital ratio from the tax hit. Your peers will have the same thing. But within the new tax law, there's also a somewhat complicated element where it eliminates the ability to carry back NOLs against prior period income, which could impact your stressed ratios. And I'm wondering, does that at all inform your outlook for the incoming test? And do you anticipate capital return capacity being more constrained just in light of some of those changes?","Marianne Lake","Okay. That was a lot. So if you assume that the 2018 structure is much like 2017 with a nice healthy caveat that DTAs, DTLs and the impact of them can be volatile based on the scenario, so with that caveat, I would tell you that not carrying back NOLs has a very particular interplay with foreign tax credits, which means it's not really going to affect us in a meaningful way. There are two things that would change, but they also offset. So the two things that would change is your absolute level of losses would be higher as the tax rate is lower, against -- and so that would be a negative. But against that, your NOL carryforward would be lower and that the capital deducts. So in the lore of very big numbers with health warnings, plus or minus, at our low point, we think not a significant impact. And then if you were to take a look at our starting point capital, I'd just make two comments.","The first is, obviously, given all of the conversations we've just had, there is also the strong possibility that we will have higher earnings in the first half of the year and be able to accrete back portions, if not all of that, capital. And secondly, for what it's worth, our actual spot capital ratios were higher than our CCAR outlook was. So both from a starting point and tax effective, I feel okay, but that's a really complicated question, and we need to, like, really work through it.","James Dimon","And there's a new sheriff in town. And they're going to be looking at the whole picture. I think it's probably more important than this one item.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Marianne, assuming the economy in 2018, '19 accelerates due to this tax reform, I think it may imply that we would have higher interest rates and possibly a steeper yield curve. Do you guys have any thoughts on what you might do to the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet? Would you change it? Or do you want to just keep it the way it is?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So I mean we -- for what it's worth, you should know our house view on interest rate is for there to be four hikes next year. The Fed says three, the market has two. I would say tax reform and a stronger growth outlook will solidify the path of rate hikes. And so we've been factoring that into our balance sheet positioning anyway. So I would not expect there to be a material change in our strategy.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then in your release in the fourth quarter, you guys said how would the tax change affect your capital distribution plans. And there's no change and the first day of distributions are going to be based on the 2017 CCAR approval. Is that in terms of the payout ratio on this 2017 CCAR, or the nominal dollars? Because obviously, your earnings now are going to be higher in the first half of '18 versus what you got approved for in the CCAR '17, which would imply, if you get the payout ratio constant, you would actually have a higher nominal payout in the first half of '18.","Marianne Lake","Our capital plan approval is on a nominal dollar basis.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","It's probably a bit early to know how to come play this, but as you think about the winners and losers from tax reform, do you think there will be changes in terms of how you come to market, where you come to market? A lot's been written obviously on the impact to some of the high tax states and how money can flow from there to others. And obviously, you're in some high tax states and also in low tax states. And just trying to think through how you might tweak your business model or you have to focus on some of your products in some of those markets.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So as I would say, I mean in essence, time is our friend. So if you go back and obviously, nothing is exactly like this. But if you go back and look at similar empirical evidence, you would say that any influences in terms of migration of flow funds is pretty modest and pretty gradual. And if you think about something as first order as housing in high tax states, well, people are pretty situated where they live with their families and their jobs and higher income borrowers activity is less price-sensitive. So I think lots and lots of things come into play. I think the area that we're getting -- that we're thinking about a little more is what's the optimal financing structure for clients given the changes across the capital market structure. But even in that sense, while you could say that may be more expensive, it's still probably cheaper than equity, and equity may be more seen as fair value. But for JPMorgan, it's core to what we do.","We do cross-border acquisition, acquisition financing, liability management, and those capital structure strategies, we do all of it. So even if the sort of mix and optimal structure change, I think we're pretty well situated. So it's early days to be able to say that we would have strategic changes. I think it's early days. And I would say that if that was to be the case, I would probably expect it to be quite marginal.","Matthew O'Connor","And then how about just more on aggregate on the consumer underwriting side, if you are feeling more positive about the economy, you're seeing the growth in consumer personal income before the tax code here that may accelerate, does that make you more open to loosening underwriting standards a little bit? Do you feel like aggregate standards are still similarly tight versus where they were pre-crisis and there could be some opportunity there for you and others?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I mean, I think that may be a fair observation but I also think, to Jamie's earlier point, as much as we would like to imagine that all of this takes effect immediately, you would need to see the benefit of the environment in the income and spending and profitability and creditworthiness of people before you would be able to lean in for the changes, if necessary, so maybe. But again, I think it's going to be something that will unfold.","James Dimon","Yes. So we haven't changed our stance very much, and the one exception that might change over time, which I hope it does actually, is in mortgage lending, where I think because of the service requirements, capital requirements, reporting requirements and various litigation uncertainty, it has tightened the credit box around people who probably deserve credit, younger people, first-time buyers, prior defaults and -- but that's going to take the agencies working together to set new rules and new guidelines. If that happens, that can actually be good for America. It doesn't not really--","Marianne Lake","And pretty immediate.","James Dimon","Yes, it's not going -- say that again?","Marianne Lake","And pretty immediate.","James Dimon","And pretty immediate. And it's not going back to subprime, it's just opening up the credit box and reducing the cost to the average mortgage, and we're hopeful that the agencies will eventually do that.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.","Andrew Lim","I just wanted to take a devil's advocate for each for a bit. I've looked at the credit markets and the oil cap has increased right across the spectrum, especially at the short turn actually rather than the long end. And I'm thinking that these high-interest rates would feed into high credit losses at some point. I'm wondering if that's part of your thinking, whether that fits into your credit quality models. And if so, at what time -- where do you think that the duration in credit might start to accelerate?","Marianne Lake","So probably it's an important thing because I think it's worth pointing out that there's been a lot of attention on the flatter yield curve, but you're right, it's driven by a higher fountain, which is a sort of good type of flattening, so to speak. And so that's what's been driving sort of NII growth for us. And we do expect that, that will, together with the Fed, normalizing the balance sheet, ultimately end up with a higher long end of the rate. So we're pretty optimistic about that. You're right that at some point, typically, you would see potentially higher rates depending on the speed and inflation and other factors that would be -- precede the potential for a credit cycle. I mean, I suspect this will be no different, but that is not something that we see in our models or in our outlook over the near term. So hopefully, the monetary policy will be gradual, and as expected, and we'll continue to see the front-end raise and everything will be rational, and of course, there could be the prices, but at some point, yes, but not in the near future.","Andrew Lim","Great. Could you say what the average maturity of your corporate loan book is or across the loan book in general?","Marianne Lake","Yes, it differs. So it's shortened--","James Dimon","It's fairly disclosed in the 10-K but it's different for every single product and also changes in interest rates moving around.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","So on your tax Q&A, you mentioned what the impact of tax reform is across different businesses from a growth standpoint, but you also talked about the potential for competition being uncertain in terms of how it impacts different businesses and different products. Can you talk to that a little bit and speak to which products and businesses you see more scope for competition, less scope for competition? And how does that influence how you think about investing in -- across your different businesses?","Marianne Lake","So I would start by saying that I think we showed at the Investor Day last year, and if were to do something similar, maybe we will, it would look very similar today, which is if you go below our top line businesses and the businesses beneath that, so the vast majority of our businesses are more than covering that cost of equity by a fair margin today. So our investment strategy, it wouldn't be directly impacted by marginal changes in pricing and profitability up or down. We're going to continue to invest in everything that we can do well to improve the customer experience and grow the business. So I think we've been pretty consistent on that, not just today but over the course of the last several years. And then I think it is uncertain. And so I would just give you the obvious extremes, which is, if you have four different organizations competing for a single large structure transaction and the cost of capital and taxes are direct input to pricing, I'm sure it will feature in the discussion. And if you are talking about a very, very scale, very, very high-volume business with extraordinarily high margins, it will probably have ultimately -- or at least in the very, very near term, less impact. But again, I actually think people will be quite disciplined how they think about this.","James Dimon","And just to tell you an example away from finance. Utilities already are being put in a position because it's part of the rate base and after-tax return, but they're going to pass it on to consumers, probably 100%. That may be different by state but it either that way. And Marianne spoke about your cap rates and stocks, and obviously, anything in the marketplace have been bid at. In the after-tax rate, you could see a pretty quick effect. It will go all the way to Hershey candy bar. It's not necessarily clear that if you sell candy or cereals and like that, you'll going to have immediate repricing effect because of the tax rate changes. So we run a whole gamut of things. And so we have to wait and see how it works out. At the end of the day, everyone benefits from that growth. And to me that's probably the most important thing.","Saul Martinez","Yes. No. That's helpful. One of the businesses that has been doing extraordinarily -- extremely well in terms of growth and profitability momentum is the Commercial Banking business, and I feel like I ask this every quarter, but I guess the question is what you can do for an encore. It's a relevant part of your earnings now and revenues and a big part of the growth. But can you just talk about to the sustainability of the momentum in terms of balance sheet growth, revenue growth, how much headway is there still to continue to grow in that business?","James Dimon","Decades, Marianne already mentioned that we are now in the top 50 MSAs. We're already getting products and services. We built technology in cash management side. We're doing a better job serving U.S. middle-market companies for their international needs. It can go on for a long time. And we're more competitive. We got very good margins and the cost and investment. People have done a great job. We got specialty finance lines. So it's just more of the same.","Marianne Lake","I think about the Commercial Bank is the absolute nexus of everything we do. It's delivering the whole company to our clients in a way that very few other people can do. And so we've been investing 100 banks in a year for a period of time, opening offices, adding capabilities, focusing on digital, improving the customer experience just like in the rest of our businesses. And so credit aside, where ultimately there will be a cycle and it will be fine. That business is really poised to do very well.","James Dimon","Yes, and I'd just add to that, and we shouldn't leave this call without talking about it. In the custody, in fund services business, we got a great new technology. We've gained -- I think it looks like we've gained a little bit of share in the emerging markets where we are probably a little bit weak. Service levels have gone way up, and I'm embarrassed to say that we weren't particularly good a couple of years ago. In Treasury Services, we're bringing you a new international payment system. The banking is rebuilt in real-time has an overall value, the real-time payment business. What we've done with the -- we feel exceptional with the customer fund services. On the consumer side, we have a whole bunch of -- we look at our digital offerings, it's gone better and better and better. There's a whole bunch more coming. Zelle and QuickPay has done -- I mean, we're not gaining share, we're definitely gaining clients. And so we have barely tried to market that. That's where real-time P2P has opened -- I think our bank has probably now like 30 or 40, it's been eventually.","Marianne Lake","Essentially everyone with a bank account.","James Dimon","Everyone's going to be open up to Zelle and -- and then of course, this year, we have beta ready. We spoke a little bit about online sim mobile banking. And these -- some of these things will all work with really great products and services, and we're pretty excited about it actually.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I just have one quick question on Securities Services. Within there you saw a good growth in your assets, on the custody up over 3% quarter-on-quarter on annualized but the revenues were up less than 1%. Could you -- were there some timing issues with when the AUC came on? And if you can kind of highlight what was the difference between AUC growth and revenue growth this quarter?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So in Securities Services, we make money on NII, we make money on transactions, we make money on AUC. And depending upon whether that's fixed income or equities or whether it's emerging markets for the U.S., we'll drive the extent of that. So it's not like you can take the overall revenue of Securities Services and link it to increases in assets under custody and draw a direct -- I mean, there's obviously a direct relationship but it's not going to necessarily move in line. So I can tell you that looking at that decomposition of what time market levels and higher flows by region and looking at the portion of our revenues that's related to assets under custody that they were in line.","James Dimon","The full year effect doesn't happen in 12 months.","Marianne Lake","It is, exactly.","James Dimon","If you even go up, they go up like $2 trillion and 2\/3 of assets going up, but that will take a year before the full year effect of that stuff. So you see partial effect actually flowing into this quarter.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Marianne Lake","Thanks, everyone.","James Dimon","Thanks for joining us, yes. Happy New Year, everybody."],"12524":["JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Q1 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call April 13, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jamie Dimon - Chairman and CEO","Marianne Lake - CFO","Analysts","John McDonald - Bernstein","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand-by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thanks operator and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page one, we are off to a good start this year with net income of $6.4 billion, EPS of $1.65, and the return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $25.6 billion with the continuing momentum from last year driving strong performance across all of our businesses.","Highlights for the quarter include average core loan growth of 9% year-on-year, reflecting growth trends across products; continued double-digit consumer deposit growth; strong card sales, up 15%; and Merchant volume up 11%. In addition, we achieved a number of records across our businesses, most notably net income and IB fees for a first quarter in the CIB; net income and revenue for the commercial bank; and asset under management and banking balances in asset and wealth management. Overall, the credit environment remained benign. In consumer, there were no reserve actions taken across our core portfolios while in wholesale we had a net reserve release of about $90 million driven by energy, resulting in net releases in both the CIB and the commercial bank.","We see no significant items here on the page, but there are a few notable items in our results that I will highlight here too. The first is the tax benefit, a bit less than $400 million and the benefit relates to the difference in stock price between vesting date and grant date for our employee equity award. And while such an adjustment is business as usual, the recent appreciation in our stock price has caused the benefit to be outside this quarter with the largest impact occurring to CIB and to a lesser extent asset and wealth management.","Second is a write-down of our student loan portfolio of approximately $160 million after tax as we move these loans to held-for-sale and explore alternatives to that portfolio. And last is Firm-wide legal expense of around $140 million after tax relating to a number of matters across businesses, some positive and negative, and with the most significant impact being in the AWM business.","Moving on to page 2 and some more detail about the first quarter. Revenues of $25.6 billion was up $1.5 billion or 6% year-on-year with the increase evenly split between net interest income and non-interest revenue. NII reflected the impact of higher rates and continued growth, and NII reflected higher CIB revenues, partially offset by card acquisition cost and lower MSR risk management.","Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 7% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher compensation on increased revenue and higher auto lease depreciation. In addition, the combination of the impact of the FDIC surcharge as well as a foundation contribution this quarter accounted to nearly $200 million of the year-on-year expense change. Adjusted for the student lending write-down I just mentioned, credit cost of $1.1 billion will be down approximately $700 million year-on-year as higher charge-offs in card were offset by a wholesale net reserve release this quarter versus a sizeable build in the prior year.","Moving to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with both standardized and advanced fully phased-in CET1 of 12.4%, in line with our expectations and overall driven by net capital generation. We continue to manage our balance sheet with discipline. Total assets returned to above $2.5 trillion, reflecting the continuation of strong deposit growth as well as our trading balance is normalizing from very low levels at the end of the year.","From a liquidity perspective, HQLA was flat at year-end and the Firm remained compliant with all liquidity requirements. We continued to grow tangible book value per share while returning $4.6 billion of net capital to shareholders in the first quarter, which included $2.8 billion of net repurchase and common dividend of $0.50. And this $4.6 billion compares to $3.8 billion returned last quarter. As you know, we recently submitted the 2017 CCAR capital plan to Federal Reserve. And as you\u2019d expect, we have no feedback to give you for now.","Moving on to page four, and the consumer and community bank. CCB generated $2 billion of net income and ROE 15%. Core loans were up 11% with strength across products. Mortgage was up 15%, card up 9%, business banking up 9% and auto loans and leases up 12%.","Deposit growth continued to outperform industry, up 11% with about half of deposit growth from existing customers as we continue to deepen relationship. We continued to see very strong growth metrics in card for the quarter with sales up 15% and new account originations up 9%.","Merchant processing volumes were up 11% year-on-year and active mobile customers up 14%. Revenue of $11 billion was down modestly; consumer and business banking revenue was up 8% on strong deposit growth and we are starting to see the long-awaited improvement in deposit margins.","Mortgage revenue was down 18%, driven by lower net servicing revenue, reflecting lower MSR risk management as well as portfolio run-off. And card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was down 3% driven by continued investment in card new account acquisitions that will provide long-term value. It was predominantly offset by net interest income on higher loan balances as well as higher auto lease income. Expense of $6.4 billion was up 5% year-on-year on auto lease depreciation and continued business growth.","Finally, the credit trend in our core portfolio remained favorable. Net charge-off increased year-on-year, primarily driven by a $470 million write-down of our student loan portfolio, against which we released $250 million of reserve and card charge-offs were up in line with expectations and in line with guidance. Moving to mortgage and auto credit, our portfolio is continues to perform very well.","Now turning to page five and the corporate and investment bank. CIB delivered a strong result with reported ROE of 18% and net income of $3.2 billion. But remember, a significant portion of the tax benefit on the stock update is reflected in these results. Revenue of $9.5 billion was up 17% year-on-year and IB fees of $1.8 billion were up 37%, partly due to a weak first quarter last year, but also given strong absolute performance this year.","In banking, IB revenue was up 34%, driven by higher overall issuance, especially in ECM including a strong IPO market. Remember, the first quarter of 2016 was particularly strong in M&A and weak in DCM for us. And this quarter, they are normalized. Overall, we gained share and ranked number one in global IB fees and number one in North America and EMEA. Looking forward sentiment is positive, market remains broadly constructive; and across products, we expect decent deal flow and the pipeline healthy.","Treasury services revenue of $981 million was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and operating deposit growth. Lending revenue of $389 million was up 29% year-on-year on higher gains on securities received from restructurings.","Moving onto markets and investor services. Markets revenue of $5.8 billion, was up 13%. At the Investor Day, the market was characterized by low volatility and subdued client activity, leading us to be somewhat cautious. March ended up being stronger than expected, reflecting some recovery in volatility, but also clients responding more to market themes including European elections and to a lesser degree stronger U.S. rates outlook.","Fixed income revenue was up 17% with credit and securitized products as key drivers on stronger client activity and significant spread tightening broadly. Rates was also solidly up as the market reacted to central bank actions and we saw a pick-up of flows in EMEA. We had a decent quarter in equity with revenue up 2% year-on-year in somewhat quiet market broadly with corporate derivatives and prime being brighter spots. Securities services revenue was $916 million, in line with guidance. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was up 7%, driven by higher performance based compensation, and the comps to revenue ratio for the quarter was 29%.","Moving on to page six, and commercial banking. Another excellent quarter in commercial banking, with the 15% ROE, revenue grew 12% year-on-year due to higher deposit, NII and continued loan growth, as well as a strong IB revenue up 34%, making this the third consecutive quarter of IB revenues of over $600 million. Expense of $825 million was impacted by a $29 million impairment on leased assets. Excluding this, we saw expense increase slightly of our guidance as we made great progress on the pace of investment which will continue to drive strong top-line growth. Looking forward, we expect our underlying expense trends be relatively flat.","Loan balances of $191 billion were up 12% over the prior year. Consistent with the industry broadly, we have seen a slowdown in C&I growth with our loan balances remaining relatively flat sequentially, although up 8% year-on-year. There are a number of factors likely contributing including potential noise in the data from large acquisitions in prior periods and a resurgence in capital markets activity, particularly in DCM including high yield. So, not to dismiss the importance of the trends, we do need to weigh all the facts and against that other macro indicators remain supportive of the economy broadly including CapEx, data and surveys, as well as very high levels of business optimism, all of which should be supportive of solid demand for credit over time.","In commercial real estate, we saw sequential growth of 3%, slightly ahead of the industry but below the pace of prior quarters, impacted both by higher rate, as well as a prudent approach to new originations given where we are in the cycle and maintaining discipline on risk adjusted returns. Credit performance remains strong with a net recovery of 2 basis points reflecting continued stability in both our C&I and CRE portfolios, and overall, a net release loan of loss reserves driven by energy.","Leaving the commercial bank and moving on to asset and wealth management on page seven. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $385 million with pretax margin and ROE each of 16%. Revenue of $3.1 billion was up $3.1 billion was up 4% year-on-year driven primarily by higher market levels and strong banking results on higher deposit NII. Recall that last year\u2019s first quarter included a one-time $150 million gain on the sale of an asset. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 24% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense. I want to emphasize that the underlying core business results remain very strong, in fact in line with the strongest performance of the business ever. This quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $8 billion with strength in fixed income and multi-assets being partially offset by outflows in equity.","Assets under management of $1.8 trillion and overall client assets of $2.5 trillion were both up 10% year-on-year, reflecting higher market levels and net inflows into both liquidity and long-term products. Finally, banking balances continue to be strong with loan and deposit up 7% and 5% respectively.","Moving onto page eight and corporate. Corporate generated $35 million of net income for the quarter. Treasury and CIO\u2019s results improved in part reflecting the benefit of high rates. And other corporate benefitted from the release of certain legal reserves.","Finally, turn to page nine and the outlook. With the addition of the March rate hike, we\u2019ve updated our NII scenarios as follows: Rate flat from here for the full year NII will be up around $4 billion. Based on the implied, NII will be up by around $4.5 billion. And of course the Fed dots would imply the possibility of three rate hikes this year, which is not fully phased in. So, expect second quarter NII to be up sequentially, approximately $400 million, consistent with what we saw this quarter.","To wrap up, these results reflect strength broadly across our businesses. We remain well positioned to benefit from client flows and a healthy economy as we serve our clients and communities, and we look forward to continuing to grow our business.","With that, operator, you can open up the lines for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning, Marianne. I just had a question about any early signs of deposit data and elasticity. I guess on the consumer side, in your retail banking area, are you seeing customers increasingly ask for higher rate in their deposit accounts or any activity where they are moving from kind of checking to savings and kind of early signs of pressure on deposit pricing?","Marianne Lake","In the retail space, the answer is no, not really. And to be completely honest, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent that we would not really have expected there to be much in terms of deposit re-price at absolute levels of rate that are still quite low. And so, with IOER at 100 basis points, we\u2019re still in that sort of realm of the atmosphere. And so, we would expect that to start happening -- a couple of rate hikes from here maybe; we\u2019ll have to wait and see. We\u2019ve obviously never really been through exactly this before. On the other side of the equation, in the wholesale space, we are in the process of seeing reprice happen.","John McDonald","Got it. Okay. And in terms of customers, they\u2019re not really asking yet or behaving in a way that they\u2019re looking price sensitive; you\u2019re not seeing any early sign of it yet?","Marianne Lake","No.","John McDonald","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","I wanted to maybe get out in front of what could be some bruise issues in retail lands. And the perspective I\u2019m looking for is you have plenty gross exposure to retail and retail related. However, there seems to be plenty of collateral, and you\u2019re typically at the top of the capital structure too. So, can you talk about both direct exposure in some of the problem retail areas and related exposure in like commercial real estate on the mall side?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I don\u2019t have all those numbers in front of me. I know that in the commercial bank, our exposure to mortgage is really pretty modest; it\u2019s around about total of $3 billion in the commercial real estate base. And I would tell you that while there obviously is a lot of discussion around retail and with some merit, it\u2019s very, case-by-case, location-by-location, specific and I kind of liken the discussion a lot to discussions we have around bricks and mortar banking businesses, which is consumer -- the way consumers engage with retailers is changing, it doesn\u2019t mean that will stop engaging with retailers. And so, it will be very specific with respect to location and tenants, and it doesn\u2019t necessary mean that retail is going to be in as much potential trouble as I think people are talking about. So, we remain cautiously -- watching it but we\u2019re very cautiously optimistic that it\u2019s not -- that it\u2019s a bit overblown.","Jamie Dimon","And you should assume that we\u2019ve looked at not just direct retail or retail related real estate, all the vendors through any potentially sort of retailers. When you put it all together, it\u2019s a little bit like there will be something there but it\u2019s nothing [indiscernible].","Glenn Schorr","Is the main reason you\u2019re positioned and the in the stack meaning -- I notice you have a lot of collateral against your exposure and like I said, you tend to be at the top of the stack; is that the main issue? I remember doing this with you guys two years ago in oil while oil was dropping and it turned you barley came out with a few cuts and bruises; this seems to be more collateral here, but\u2026","Jamie Dimon","Are you talking about real estate related retail or are you talking about retail or are you talking about retailers?","Glenn Schorr","I\u2019m talking both, because you do have hundreds of billions of direct retail exposure plus commercial real estate exposed to it. I\u2019m just making\u2026","Jamie Dimon","You are way out of line. I mean direct retail exposure, we\u2019re very careful; retail business has always been violent and volatile. You can look back to our history and half of them are gone after 10 years that is a normal course. So, we are usually senior; we\u2019re very careful of our debt. And when you go to real estate, most of the real estate has nothing to do with retail. So, we do have some shopping centers, malls and buildings and stuff like that. But those are generally items that well secured, not relying on single retailers et cetera.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I was just looking at taking a temperature.","Jamie Dimon","It will be like oil and gas process; it won\u2019t be a big deal.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Marianne. Can you give us some color on the credit card area? In terms of -- I know you upped your credit card losses early in the year in investor day in the fall of last year. What\u2019s your guys\u2019 outlook for the credit losses and the credit card portfolio? Where would you tolerate it to and at what point do you really change the underwriting standards, if you need to?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, one of the things that we want to remind everybody before we talk about the trend is that the credit card losses are still at absolutely very, very low levels. And not withstanding whatever we would have done or have done or continue to do with our credit books, we would ultimately have expected them to normalize to higher rates regardless.","Gerard Cassidy","Agreed.","Marianne Lake","And then, obviously, the first quarter hasn\u2019t been...","Jamie Dimon","Through the cycle...","Marianne Lake","Yes, exactly. And obviously first quarter has some seasonality. So, I would just start by saying that the charge-off rates we\u2019re seeing are completely in line with our expectations and guidance that we gave you at Investor Day, both in terms of 2017 being below 3% and over the medium-term between 3 and 3.25. So, all the reasons that we articulated, a combination of positive credit expansion that took place over the last couple of years and performance of those newer vintages is in line with our expectations and with high risk adjusted margins. So, it\u2019s not really about tolerating the charge-offs, as long as we\u2019re getting paid properly for the risk, which is the case. And obviously as we see the charge-off rates normalize and reflect those newer vintages, they will go up modestly over time. And we expanded our credit in the targeted way, but it wasn\u2019t a significant expansion. And we will respond in our credit and risk appetite to whatever we\u2019re seeing in the environment, but it won\u2019t necessarily be predicated by charge-off rates.","Gerard Cassidy","And as a follow-up, obviously you have very strong investment banking on the FICC trading side, very strong capital market numbers. Are you guys seeing further evidence of taking more market share from your competitors in any of the product lines, whether it\u2019s investment banking or FICC trading or equity trading et cetera?","Marianne Lake","So, I would say, if you look back over 2016 and even 2015 and 2016, it\u2019s true and clear that we gained share, not just in fixed income, reasonable share, not just in fixed income but also in equity. And our business performed well last year. And I would suggest to you that we will defend that share, but the competition is back and healthy and you can\u2019t expect us to continue to gain share at those kinds of levels, we want to defend it, but it\u2019s a healthy competitive market right now. So I would say not really.","Operator","And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Couple of questions, one on card. How large are you willing to be in card? I think on various metrics, you\u2019re between 15% and 22% depending on if you\u2019re looking at things like merchant acquiring or at the balances and card in general as a percentage of total outstandings in the country?","Jamie Dimon","We have a ways to go before we\u2019 concerned.","Betsy Graseck"," [Multiple speakers] last cycle, you were nimble and do you still feel that you can be nimble at this market share?","Jamie Dimon","For merchant processing, there is a lot share you can gain and that\u2019s not even close, because the products and services and change n technology. I think we\u2019re way away in credit card when you say well that\u2019s too big for JPMorgan Chase. There is a point where it\u2019s going to be a good question, but it\u2019s not even remotely close to this one.","Marianne Lake","And I would also say that card continues to be a pretty competitive space. So, we will continue to try and provide our customers with significant value and have deep engaged relationships. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see material shift in share in the short-term.","Jamie Dimon","And we also look strategically at credit card, debit card, online bill pay, P-to-P is all one big thing to do a great job for clients.","Betsy Graseck","And then, when you\u2019re thinking about the credit box, I know a while back you mentioned, okay we\u2019ve widened the box to 680, is there any interest is widening it further?","Marianne Lake","Not specifically at this point. I think we\u2019re very happy with the performance of the portfolio with the growth rate we are getting and our core card loans were up 9% year-over-year and was getting a lot of NII benefit from that. So I think we\u2019re still pretty well positioned at this point.","Betsy Graseck","So, loan growth should probably stay in line with where it is or slow down, is that how we should we be thinking about?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I would say, loan growth should be in the mid to high single digits.","Operator","Your next question is from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. I am going to follow up on the NII question. I think your implied guidance of 4.5 billion higher than 2016 is now at the 500 million from where you were at the Investor Day. Is that lower deposit beta experienced, what\u2019s driving I guess the modest increase? And then, just as a follow-up on that in terms of if we do -- the implied curve I think has about one more rate hike in June, if we were to get another one, realize the dot plot too and another one in September, would that be immaterial increase in that expectation or just incremental or just how do we think about that?","Marianne Lake","So, I would -- obviously when we give you guidance, we give you sort of reasonably rounded numbers. So, actually the impact of [indiscernible] is a bit more than $500 million, more than was at the Investor Day, and a lot of big numbers that are pretty reasonable. Yes, there is an element of course as we talk about in the wholesale space where we are seeing reprice happen and it does reflect our estimates as to what we expect to see over the course of the year in cumulative deposit basis. And with respect to if there was a note that implies -- one and half more hike. So, it\u2019s probably March is earlier, so longer -- a little bit more rate benefit but it\u2019s sort of in line with our expectations. And if we had another rate hike, it would likely be later in the year and ultimately have relatively modest impact on this year but obviously be important going forward.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, so anything in September would be sort of incremental?","Marianne Lake","You should be able to extrapolate those numbers on your own.","Jim Mitchell","Yes, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hi. Good morning. Marianne, you noted the obvious slowdown we\u2019ve seen in C&I, and Jamie, in the press release, you talk about the consumers and businesses being healthy in the pro-group initiatives. Since the analyst day, we obviously had Obamacare not go through and then there has been some doubt on tax reforms. So, just wondering can you help us understand just where you\u2019re seeing that slowdown in C&I and how would -- where are we in terms of that confidence turning into real results and how much is just the wait and see versus where the economy actually is?","Marianne Lake","I think it\u2019s important to put that in context. I mean, we did have 8% growth year-on-year in C&I, we\u2019re just saying sequentially things are a bit quieter and there are whole bunch of reasons that could be driving that. And importantly, you mentioned it, when we are in dialogue with our clients, they are optimistic and they are thinking about growing their businesses and hiring and all of those things are true. And so putting aside those and we have access to capital market for a variety of reasons in newer bank loans. And it\u2019s completely understandable that optimism would lead actions. And so, what that implies, we\u2019ll wait and see but fundamentally a pro-growth series of policies will be constructive to the economy, to our clients and ultimately will end up. And them hiring, spending and they already are, and we\u2019ll see that translate into loan growth. Whether that\u2019s in the second half of this year, we\u2019ll see.","Jamie Dimon","I wouldn\u2019t overreact to the short term in our loan growth with so many that affect it. When you go to the episodic part, when you look at CIB, I don\u2019t look at loan growth at all because companies have a choice of loans and deals or bonds and like that. Credit card looks okay, mortgage is obviously affected by interest rates, auto is obviously affected by auto sales, and middle market was okay, it was slow but it was okay. So, I wouldn\u2019t react to that. The second thing is, you all should expect as a given that when you have a new president and he gets going that nine months, after the 100 days it\u2019s going to be sausage making period. There will be ups and downs, wins and loss stuff like that. And what you see is a pro-growth agenda, tax infrastructure, regulatory reform and that is a good thing all things being equal. And we think that it should be helpful for Americans. To expect it to be smooth sailing, that would be silly.","Ken Usdin","Yes, fair point, fair point. And just one quick follow-up just on the deal making side, M&A slowed a little bit, but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the same point, Jamie just in terms of pipelines and expectations that corporates have about transacting. Does that fit into that same vein or is there anything different in terms of just companies getting strategic, getting more aggressive in terms of acquiring and adding to their businesses?","Jamie Dimon","It looks fine but of course it\u2019s episodic.","Marianne Lake","And I would also say that while of course people\u2019s dialogues include a degree of discussion around regulatory reform and tax reform and the like, it isn\u2019t stopping the strategic dialogue and it isn\u2019t stopping from -- or boards from considering strategic deals partly because of what you said, partly because there is a recognition that we think will take some to ultimately get finalized and really won\u2019t put their strategic agenda on hold. So, in some ways, you get both sides of the equation; people aren\u2019t going to wait indefinitely to get certainty on issues when there are good strategic deals that can be done and that\u2019s part of the dialogue, do not say has not impact but it\u2019s still quite healthy.","Operator","Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on deposit pricing in a sense that before the Fed starts moving up deposit rates and the Fed funds rates were right on top of each other around 15 basis points. Now the effective Fed funds rates around 90 basis points and deposit costs are only 20. So that\u2019s 70 basis points on your $1 trillion of deposits basically gives you about $7 billion worth of incremental revenue. This needed to cover the cost of branches and other things for those deposit franchise. At what point do you hit a targeted kind of spread and where is that where you begin to at least break even on those costs versus revenues?","Jamie Dimon","Can I just answer that? Marianne has given you guys some very specific guidance on interest rates. When interest rates got to zero, remember that when it floored, no one expected 25 to 50 basis points to necessarily be paid out. This was a cost. Marianne also gave you at Investor Day, a very forward looking view of that where it kind of normalizes. And it\u2019s different for every different type of deposit. The wholesale deposits, commercial credit deposits, company deposits, treasury deposits, they\u2019re all different. So, it\u2019s hard to summarize it all. But at one point, you\u2019re going to back to kind of a normalized spread. In terms of just retail, I would say that\u2019s like 3%, maybe a little less.","Marianne Lake","Maybe a little less. And I would also just say, I am glad that you brought up one point because, it\u2019s something that I like -- a point that I\u2019d like to make, which is when people think about the benefit we get from NII and rising rates, there is an element of people making it sound very passive. Yes, you\u2019re correct, we did build those loans, we acquired those customers, we built in the products, we invested in the customer service and so to be able to enjoy the industry-leading deposit rates that we\u2019re having. But I would also make -- and so as margins improved and we will obviously enjoy the benefit of that, and to your point, we invested to be able to. But I will say that if we look at the performance of our branches, every single week, month, individually together by market and the very, very, very vast majority of them, meaning there are only a handful are profitable in their own rights today at these spreads on a margin basis. So, the branches are doing very well.","Jamie Dimon","Another number that we gave you, you should look at, we gave you what we expect normalized margins and normalized returns to be in consumer, card only businesses. There was numbers include normalized credit card charge-offs, like the credit card, the number we now use for the quarter, something like that. And in retail going back to normal spreads, that\u2019s what those numbers include. And of course, they all bounce around. We kind of look at the business, we price for normalized results, we don\u2019t price for, which is overearning or underearning and you have too much credit, too little, and that\u2019s kind of how we run the business.","Marty Mosby","Follow-up to that is really what I\u2019m getting at is last year, everybody was assuming through the cycle kind of betas and we were saying that there will be much lower early on. We do think once you get to a certain target, usually about 100 basis points of spread, you start to see a little bit more pricing pressure starting to kick-in, just like you were saying Jamie different products\u2026","Jamie Dimon","We\u2019ve built that in every number we\u2019ve given you. We\u2019ve always told the beta and gamma.","Marianne Lake","I can point you to our presentation in May of 2014 where we showed exactly what we expected deposit reprice to look like based upon historical moves. And so, what we have actually we\u2019re seeing today looks incredibly similar in terms of realized reprice. You\u2019re actually right. I will tell you thought that history may not be a precise predicator of the future, because we\u2019ve never really been in that exact position before, and other things play into the equation including the fact that the industry but us specifically have significantly invested in other customer service products, items like digital and the like, which will change the dynamic one way or another on reprice. So, you\u2019re right, historically 100, 150 basis points, if there\u2019s movement, we\u2019ll see.","Marty Mosby","And the last component of this is, the balances continue to grow. So, as long as we\u2019re seeing double-digit kind of sequential annualized and year-over-year growth in deposits, that provides a little bit cover and the sense of what you\u2019re talking as well. We may see a little bit more lag, just because we\u2019re still kind of continuing to get deposit growth?","Jamie Dimon","Yes. We feel great about deposit growth and the account growth. So, we have new accounts, we\u2019re growing and existing accounts are growing. Remember, you have to be very careful because if rates were higher, people do different things with their money, like CDs and then how they view the stock market, that money -- some of that is actually in this. So, we\u2019re always conscious of the fact that those flows ebb and flow and history is only a somewhat of a guide to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning. I had a few questions on the regulation. Jamie, in your shareholder letter, you\u2019ve dedicated a lot of time on mortgage and have it opening that up for banks to originate more of the percentage of mortgage in the United States. As we look forward, do we need legislative change for the banks to gain more market share from non-banks in mortgage like clarity in QM or the CSPB or would changes in supervisory attitudes be enough for that to shift on the mortgage side?","Jamie Dimon","I think that category out precisely because it didn\u2019t take legislation and it was very important. And my point isn\u2019t about banks versus non-banks. My point is about the United States of America and what these things did to the availability of credit to certain class of people. I was very specific, we actually published a research report in mortgage land, which you can go get by Mr. Joseph that really breaks it out. But because of the cost of servicing delinquent accounts, $2,000 a year, because of the additional cost of origination, because of the potential litigation, because of the not clarity around the QM, because of the forward claims that the consumers both pay more and the credit box is wider. And then, we actually believe that credit box is hurting first time buyers, younger, self employed, prior defaults. So, when defaults happen, they deserve a second change. So, the policy has restricted that. And the shocking thing to me is the absolute size of that which we think could be 3 to $500 billion a year. That one thing alone could edit -- if you think about second stagnations, could have been 0.3 or 0.4% a year growth, changed five years ago, you\u2019re talking about a lot of growth, a lot of jobs, a lot new homes, a lot of young families into homes and very positive, not taking a lot of extra risk, not -- it was about America, while we are executing less of the banks to non-banks. That\u2019s my point about that\u2019s how it\u2019s hurting growth of America and hurting that class of citizens. And I really think somebody should be right about that, that\u2019s how important it is. That was one example.","Erika Najarian","That\u2019s clear. Thank you. And the follow-up to that is a couple of week ago or so, there was a lot of talk from Washington about the current administration potentially supporting Glass-Steagall and of course a lot of your investors called in concerned. And Jamie and Marianne, two part question; I am wondering if that\u2019s a real worry for JPMorgan shareholders? And second Marianne, maybe in Investor Day two years ago, you mentioned that the capital and the cost that a breakup would save, was not that much. And I am wondering if you could also -- if you remember, refresh us on that analysis?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, I will just start by saying we\u2019ve been consistent that our operating model including the diversification of our businesses has been and was a source of strength, not just for us but also for the financial market during the crisis, and there is strength in the way the company operates that can\u2019t be discounted. I would also say that the commentary feels unnecessary given where the industry stands on capital liquidity and regulatory reform broadly. And I know at this point, as I\u2019m sure you al read too, most recently Governor Tarullo making comment about but historically other thought leaders in the financial stability space I\u2019m talking about, and I would to say that it doesn\u2019t feel, for reasons that you\u2019ve articulated in terms of structural reform or structural change in model and things. So that would be consistent with a level playing field and pro-growth agenda in the U.S. So, that\u2019s kind of how we feel about it. I can\u2019t give you specific reasons to not continue to monitor the situation, but it doesn\u2019t consistent with the rest of the objective of the administration.","And with respect to Investor Day couple of years ago, lots of things have fundamental changed since then, but the ultimate conclusion hasn\u2019t, which is that we believe that there is significantly more value for our shareholders and as I said before, for the economy with this Company the way it is today than in some other forms.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","We\u2019ve obviously seen quite a bit of flattening of the yield curve and it could reverse pretty quickly if there is progress made on the pro-growth agenda, but just talk about at what point does the flatter yield curve start to impact NIM? And I guess I\u2019m thinking specifically if we get a couple more hikes on the short end but the long end either doesn\u2019t move, the long end comes down more. How do we think about the breakpoint in terms of NIM benefit with short end being offset by the flatter yield curve?","Marianne Lake","First of all, we don\u2019t over think change of the curve or part of normalization in any one period, we think about the reason for the actions and ultimately as long as the economy is growing, you\u2019ll see both of the front end and long end of rate ultimately go up. And even though I know that is lower when we broken down, broken below a little bit of a low bound, seeing in the kind of 230, 260 range for a while. So, we\u2019re still within -- largely speaking within the range. And I anticipate that we are going to see the 10-year higher by the end of the year. And if you look our earnings disclosures, we\u2019re much more sensitive to -- as a pure NII NIM matter to the front end rate. And so not to say we would not have an impact, but it would take a while for that to have an impact that would meaningfully offset any of the benefit of higher short-end rate.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then separately, as we think about central banks winding down some of the QE and the Fed actually shrinking their holdings, how do you think about that impacting your businesses? Obviously there might be a rate impact; I think you talked about expectations quite a bit. But just how do you think it impact say from markets business with potentially more assets kind of out there to be purchased and sold?","Marianne Lake","I mean ultimately any actions by central banks, anything, in the shape of the yield, anything that is presenting an opportunity for client to transact and trade, there is an opportunity for all businesses. So, as long as it happens in a reasonably rational fashion, and there are no significant events, it just creates an opportunity for clients and then opportunity therefore for us.","Jamie Dimon","It always keep in mind that why they do something probably is more important than what they do. So, if they\u2019re doing it because the American economy is getting stronger, that is more important to be a direct effect of adding -- letting securities mature et cetera.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Yes. I guess just two thoughts on, there\u2019s the impact of QE on the economy and the impact of QE on some of the markets businesses that maybe there has been a crowding out from all the QE, so as they unwind that it could actually boosts activity levels?","Jamie Dimon","It could, I just wouldn\u2019t put that in your models.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thank you for taking my question. Just a couple of questions on consumer. We\u2019ve talked a lot about card losses. But one thing that seems to be a little bit unusual is that a lot of the commentary across many of the card issuers is for the expectations of losses to be higher in the first half than second half. And I just want to get your perspective on the likelihood of that trajectory.","Marianne Lake","So, well, I mean -- so, in terms of rates, obviously, the loan balances are seasonally low in the first quarter and charge-off rates are higher in the first quarter. But, overall, we\u2019re not expecting to see abnormal patterns in our charge-offs.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on auto. Your lease a little bit to the impact of declining residual values, which has been of course a focus for the past couple of years. Was there anything unusual in your view about the pace of decline in residual values in this first quarter?","Jamie Dimon","Because it happens every 5 or 10 years, so why would anyone be surprised? And we\u2019ve always been very conscious of this and very careful about how we do leases, we do it conservatively\u2026.","Marianne Lake","And we only do\u2026 ","Jamie Dimon","[Multiple speakers] manufactures and we properly account for it, and we have loss mitigation. That\u2019s pretty important. So, no, we\u2019re not surprised it\u2019s going to happen every now and then.","Eric Wasserstrom","But in terms of pace of residual values from here, similar or different in your view?","Jamie Dimon","I have no idea.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Marianne, let me start with the question on the net revenue rate in the card services business. That\u2019s been relatively steady, little over 10% for the last couple of quarters. I presume given your outlook that that would stay pretty close to the 10.1% level that you reported for the last couple of quarters or are you thinking about a change there as you slightly change your marketing strategy?","Marianne Lake","So, it\u2019s actually got somewhat less to do with our marketing strategy than it has to do with the fantastic success we\u2019ve had with new products, Sapphire Reserve in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year. So, but fundamentally, if you go back, I think to a conference that Kevin Waters spoke at last year sometime in I think September, he said look, we\u2019re going to see the revenue rate be lower, about 10 and some for the couple of quarters, while we acquire all of these accounts. Once we\u2019ve hit a pace, we should see middle out and 10.5 the full year of 2017. So the first quarter lower and subsequent quarters continuing to now start rising back up towards the 11.25% which was ultimate run rate target and that\u2019s still fundamentally what we\u2019re expecting to see, which is, we\u2019re at -- assuming, there are expectations of what we\u2019re going to see an account growth over the future period continues to hold, we would expect to see an increase from here in the second quarter, the overall year to be sort of finish in the mid-10s and end year 11-ish and then goes back to 11.25 over the course of next couple of years.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thank you. Jamie, maybe a question [multiple speakers]. Fair enough. Jamie, a question for you, just another one on the regulatory landscape. There are number of open positions inside the Beltway at a number of the primary bank regulators. And I am just curious in terms -- pardon me?","Jamie Dimon","I said I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019m kidding.","Matt Burnell","Well somebody should fill those spots, if it\u2019s not you. I am just curious what you\u2019re thinking is of the timing of those appointments and how quickly those could get filled and what benefit that might provide to the banking industry.","Jamie Dimon","I\u2019ve been clear, I think Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin are doing the right thing; they want to find the right people for jobs. They are talking about our data, they are talking about lots of people, but even after they announced it, remember they need to be vetted and confirmed that could take 90 days. So, the sooner, the better, but I think getting the right people is equally important.","Operator","And we have no other questions in queue at this time.","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, just Glenn, I think you\u2019re still on; I\u2019ve got a couple of numbers for you in terms of retail exposure. Our direct retail exposure in the hotel space is about $20 billion, more than 70% investment grade and more than 15% secured. And in terms of commercial real estate, about $11 billion, largely ABL, pick the right name, structural protection, all the things you talked about. So, not that it\u2019s nothing but it\u2019s in the context of our overall total lending portfolio. It\u2019s not as concentrated I think as you were implying. So, if you want to call Investor Relations and that is not what you were looking at, we can try and reconcile those numbers for you. Okay. Thank you everyone.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and you may now disconnect."],"12525":["JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand-by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thanks operator and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page one, the firm reports a record net income of $7 billion, EPS of $1.82 and a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $26.4 billion. Included in the result is a legal benefit of approximately $400 million after tax from a previously announced settlement involving the FDIC's Washington Mutual receivership.","Other notable items predominantly net result changes and legal expense were a small net negative this quarter, so underlying adjusted performance was really strong and highlights of the quarter include average core loan growth of 8% year-on-year, reflecting continued growth across products; double-digit consumer deposit growth; strong card sales, up 15%; and Merchant volume up 12%; number one, global IB fees up 10% and we delivered record net income in both Commercial Banking and in Asset & Wealth Management.","Moving on to Page 2 and some more details about the quarter, revenues of $26.4 billion was up $1.2 billion or 5% year-on-year with the increase predominantly in net interest income up approximately $900 million reflecting continued loan growth and the impact of higher rates. Fee revenue was up $300 million year-on-year, but adjusting for one-time items in both years was down modestly. With lower fixed income markets, mortgage and card revenue, all as guided being offset by strong fee revenue growth across remaining businesses.","Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was up a little less than $400 million year-on-year with auto leases being the biggest driver, but also increasing the impact of the FDIC surcharge and broader growth being offset by lower compensation. Credit cost of $1.2 billion were down $187 million year-on-year on new reserve build. And a net reserve build in Consumer of a little over $250 million driven by card was offset by a net release in wholesale of a little under $250 million driven by Energy. Anticipating you may have questions given the recent Gas & Oil prices, I would emphasize that we guided to expect reserve releases given we started the year with $1.5 billion of energy related reserves and with oil prices having found a lower but seemingly stable level we feel appropriately reserved.","Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. You can see in the red circle on the page here that we ended the quarter with binding fully phased in CET 1 12.5% under the standardized approach with the improvement being primarily driven by capital generation offset by net loan growth. We've been hovering around the inflection point under the Collins Floor for a while now and expect standardized to remain our binding constrain from here. Given that, we've replicated this page under standardized rules in the appendix, please read.","Balance sheet, risk weighted assets and SLR, all remained relatively flat from the prior quarter and while not on the page, I would also note that we remained compliant with all liquidity requirements. We were pleased to announce growth repurchase capacity of up to $19.4 billion over the next four quarters and the Board announced its intention to increase common stock dividends 12% to $0.56 a share effective in the third quarter. In addition, we recently submitted our 2017 resolution plan which we believe fully addresses outstanding regulatory feedback.","Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16.5%. We continue to grow core loans up 9% year-on-year driven by strength in mortgage up 12%, card and business banking were each up 8% and auto loans and leases were also up 8% driven by strong lease performance from our manufacturing partners. Deposit rate continues to be strong up 10% year-on-year with household retention remaining at historically high levels. Before improvement in our deposit margin up 16 basis points. Sales growth in card was very strong again this quarter up 15% as new accounts mature and merchant processing volumes grew double-digits up 12%.","Revenue of $11.4 billion was flat year-on-year, but recall that last year included a net benefit of about $200 million principally driven by the Visa Europe gain. So excluding that revenue was up modestly. Consumer & Business banking revenue was up 13% on both strong deposit growth and margin expansion.","Mortgage revenue was down 26% and higher rates drove higher funding cost which together with lower MSR risk management and lower production margins the pressure on mortgage revenue year-over-year.","In addition, revenue increase and a reduction of approximately $75 million to net interest income related the capitalized interest on modified loans. And card commercialization and auto revenue was down 3%, but if you exclude the non-core items I mentioned was up 2%. With NII growth on higher loan balances and higher auto lease income predominantly offset by the continued impact of investments in card new account acquisitions. Expense of $6.5 billion was up 8% year-on-year on higher auto lease depreciation, higher marketing expense and continued underlying business growth.","Finally on credit performance, card services drove higher net charge-offs year-on-year, but still within our guidance for the full year of less than 3%. Net reserve builds were around $250 million building $350 million in card, $50 million in business banking and 25 million in auto, in part due to loan growth and in part higher loss rates in card. This was partially offset by a release of $175 million in mortgage reflecting continued improvement in home prices and lower delinquencies.","To touch on consumer delinquency trends in particular in card we were seeing some early signs of normalization which are generally in line with our expectations and our credit risk appetite and in auto our trends are relatively flat.","Now turning to Page 5 on the Corporate Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.7 billion on revenue of $8.9 billion and an ROE of 14.5%. In banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year-on-year with strong performance across products and particular strength in DCM. We ranked number one in global IB fees and number one in North America and EMEA. We were also number one in ECM and DCM globally and each case gaining share for the first half of this year.","Advisory fees were up 8% benefiting from a large number of deals closing this quarter. Equity underwriting fees were up 29% better than the market, but relative to a weak prior year quarter. With a strong market backdrop and supported valuations we saw continued momentum in global issuance especially IPOs. And debt underwriting fees were up 5% from a strong quarter last year driven by the high flow volume of repricing and refinancing activity even with fewer large acquisition financings.","In terms of the outlook, we expect IB fees in the second half of the year to be down year-on-year given that we had the highest IB fees on records for the third quarter last year. That said, overall sentiment remains positive, ECM issuance is expected to continue given the stable market backdrop and the M&A backlog is healthy with conditions remaining constructive for refinancing activities.","Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 18% driven by higher rates as well as operating deposit growth. Lending revenue of $373 million was up 35% reflecting lower mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual lends.","Moving on to Markets, total revenue was $4.8 billion down 14% year-on-year. Fixed income revenue was down 19% with decent performance across products relative to a very strong second quarter last year which was driven by higher levels of volatility and activity broadly, including as a result of Brexit. This quarter conversely can be characterized by a lack of idiosyncratic events resulting in sustained low volatility, reduced flows and continued credit spreads tightening, all of which impacted activity levels in rates, credit rating and commodities.","Emerging market performance was relatively stronger on a weaker dollar and lower rate as well as some regional events. Equities revenue was down 1%. In derivatives on the structured side we did quite well and outperformed and on the flow end we held our own in a quiet and therefore challenging environment. Prime is a bright spot as we are realizing the benefit of the investments we've been consistently making.","Before I move on, I would also like to remind you that the third quarter of 2016 markets revenue was also a record since 2010, in fact it was about a billion dollars more than the average of the previous five years. And so while that is in the guidance it is context as this quarter has felt quiet more like prior years.","Securities services revenue of $982 million was up 8% driven by higher rates and higher asset based fees on higher market levels and remember the second quarter benefits from dividend seasonality. Finally expense of $4.8 billion was down 5% year-on-year driven by lower compensation expense and the comp to revenue ration for the quarter was 28%.","Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Another quarter of excellent performance with record revenue and net income and an ROE of 17%. Revenue grew 15% driven by the deposit NII as the rate environment continues to be favorable and on higher loan balances with spreads remaining steady. IB revenue was down due to the lack of large deal activity during the quarter, but underlying flow activity was solid across products as momentum continued and forwards pipelines appeared strong.","Expense of $790 million was up 8% and we expect this to grow moderately in the second half as we continue to execute on the investments in bankers and technology that we outlined at investor day. Loan balances were up 12% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 4% sequentially ahead of the industry on broad based growth across market and within specialized industries. CRE showed growth of 2% in line with the industry but below last year's pace on reduced origination activity as we continue to be selective at this stage in the cycle. Finally, credit performance remained very strong with a net charge-off rate of 2 basis points.","Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported record net income of $624 million with pretax margin of 32% and an ROE of 27%. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year driven primarily by higher market levels but also strong banking results on higher deposit NII. Expense of $2.2 billion was up 4% year-on-year driven by a combination of higher external fees and compensation on higher revenue.","This quarter, we saw net long term inflows of $9 billion with positive flows across multi-assets, fixed income and alternatives being partially offset by outflows in equity products. We saw net liquidity outflows of $7 billion largely due to the Pacific client deal related cash needs. Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.6 trillion were both up 11% year-on-year on high market levels.","Deposits were flat year-on-year and down 5% sequentially reflecting the beginning of balance migration into investment related assets as expected and those balances remained with us. Finally, loan balances were up 9% year-over-year driven by mortgage up nearly 20%.","Moving on to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $570 million which includes the legal benefit I mentioned earlier of $645 million in revenue or $400 million after tax. And a reminder, this is the same $645 million that was publicly announced in August 2016 and represents partial reimbursement for costs that we previously incurred and paid that remained the responsibility of the WaMu receivership.","Finally turn to Page 9 and the Outlook. Starting with the quarter we guided second quarter NII to be up about $400 million from the third quarter given the rate hike, but you'll see that the NII deposits increased by only $150 million while we did fully realize the expected benefit of higher rate and continued growth, against that we had the one-time $75 million mortgage adjustment as well as lower CIB markets NII. These effects together with modest downward pressure from lower tenure rate with all other things equal point to a full year number of closer to $4 billion up, while this is in the previous 4.5, but with the potential to be higher if we continue to benefit from tailwinds of lower deposit re-price.","So you will see, we have adjusted the guidance on the page, but it will be market dependent and any near-term forecast is sensitive to a number of factors none of which changes our conviction that we will ultimately deliver $11 billion plus of incremental NII as rates normalize and we are well on our way.","On expense, we continue to expect full year adjusted expense of $58 billion. Second quarter was in line with our expectations and our guidance as a little better than $14.5 billion which is also where we expect the third quarter to come in. Finally, we have revised our full year core loan growth down to 8% year-over-year with a couple of comments.","First, we are seeing slightly lower growth than we expected, coming into the year, it is only modestly lower and more importantly, we remain encouraged by the consistency and breadth of client demand across products. Secondly, we noted that mortgage could be a big driver and with a smaller market and a more competitive environment fewer loans have met our hurdle rate. And of course we remain appropriately focused on quality and not quantity of growth and as such loan growth is an outcome, not target.","So to wrap up, we are very pleased with the firm's performance this quarter with all of our businesses showing broad strength. We maintained or improved leadership positions and are delivering the benefits to both clients and shareholders of our operating model and our continued investments. We remain encouraged by the growth outlook for the global economy and expect continued solid growth here in the U.S., which positions us well going forward.","And with that operator, you can open up the line to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Audio Gap] Line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hello there. How are you?","Marianne Lake","Good.","Glenn Schorr","During the quarter that Jamie had made a comment on potential disruptions related to the unwinding of the U.S. balance sheet, and I'm just curious, it's supposed to be slow and deliver, but I'm curious, how you think that impacts liquidity, the yield curve, trading, that participates in and is there anything you can do to protect JPMorgan against those disruptions?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I would just stop for a second to just point out what Jamie actually said was, this is uncharted territory. It\u2019s not something that we've seen before and so while it is the case that the Fed is communicating clearly and has every intention to make this gradual and predictable things can change and we should be prepared for that, not to say that that would have a particularly significant impact necessarily on JPMorgan, but that that would just be a downside risk, not a probability.","So on the balance sheet, it is still the case that we expect to start seeing normalization in the balance sheet, in September, if not in September by the end of this year with the actually calling for the next rate hike in December the market is calling for March of next year. And as we said the communication has been pretty consistent and pretty clear across the Fed space, which is to say that is mostly price into the market at this as far as we can tell.","And so based upon what we've understood moving we could, we would see the balance sheet shrink about $1.5 trillion over about the next four years. So that would ultimately slow growth not stock price and if we saw a $1.5 trillion come out of the Fed's balance sheet empirical evidence would suggest that we don't see dollar for dollar reduction in deposits.","So if you just pick a point between 500 and a $1 trillion of deposit outflows at our 10% market share that would be about $75 billion over full-year. So it would slow growth. It would not stop growth and it is what we've been expecting and what we've been talking about now for an extended period and gradual is good enough. In respect of which deposits we would like to see, so that's the sort of growth scenario.","In terms of liquidity, again evidence would suggest and we\u2019ve been communicating this quite clearly that we think preponderance of that deposit outflow would be wholesale deposits and that would be non-operating deposits and those are deposits we ascribe little to no liquidity value to. And so assuming that we're close to right, we would see those deposits ultimately leave the system, but it wouldn't affect materially if at all our liquidity position.","So ultimately the yield curve has priced I think all of this in. What I think the Fed has been clear about is that they expect the balance sheet or hope the balance sheet to be in the background and to use short rate as their primary monetary policy tool and so as a result, we would ultimately expect to see perhaps the flattening yield curve, but with the front end ultimately putting the long end up and you heard the Chair Yellen talk about being conscious of the shape of the curve as they go about normalization. I think you may have asked something else, did I missed anything?","Glenn Schorr","No that was absolutely awesome. I do have one tiny follow up. You always get a little more than you wanted. Thank you. The one tiny followup Marianne is I just want to make clear that the whole $4 billion versus $4.5 billion and you spelled out what happened in the quarter, it sounded like most of that full year guidance happened in this second quarter, but I just want to clarify that in terms of the second half NII, but do you think it's overly different from where we were a quarter ago?","Marianne Lake","No that\u2019s correct. We saw that compared to $400 million expectation, we were up $150 million, so it would be fair to say that most of it was in this quarter. We had also - when we gave the last guidance of 4.5, we pointed out the tenure was low and that that was ultimately pressuring that 4.5, so it really isn't that significant of a change.","The only thing I would caution you to remember is that when we think about asset sensitivity, we think about NII, market NII which we wouldn't consider to be in a traditional sense cool, can exhibit volatility geographically with NIR. If you think about a market making business where we can have assets altering of NII hedged by derivatives that ultimately have enough to NIR, we actually think about that in total revenue numbers, so there could be a little noise in there, but no I'm not expecting there to be significant changes.","But I think what this - what this makes me realize acutely is that no good deed ever goes unpunished and chasing our tails re-forecasting the full year NII every three quarters isn\u2019t as important or every quarter isn\u2019t as important as keeping our eye on the long term, which is nothing has changed, we are absolutely realizing the benefits we expected in the banking book assets and liabilities, and that means that our long-term projections will be good and the path is a little bit less important.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hi good morning, Marianne. So thanks for that clarity on the trading related NII. I wanted to follow up on the loan yield side, which were not much moves and you mentioned the $75 million in mortgage. Can you just help us walk through the loan portfolio and whether you're seeing the assets move and whether there is a lag or whether there's any spread compression underneath that?","Marianne Lake","Yes so, I understand why you\u2019re asking. If you look at the loan yields relatively flat or even slightly down, if you adjust for the mortgage it would be flat, if you decompose them into wholesale versus retail, we are absolutely seeing all of the yield improvement on the wholesale side about 10-ish basis points. And on the consumer side at this with respect to this quarter, there was some mix impacts in the card business as we saw higher level of transactions and still feel the sting. So it\u2019s not to say that the loan yields aren\u2019t moving in line with our expectations and they are, but mix will matter for any one quarter.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So would that naturally say that as we go forward that should, if they're moving the right way mix adjusted they should kind of move the right way from here?","Marianne Lake","Yes that\u2019s right and if you look back last quarter they did too.","Ken Usdin","Yes.","Marianne Lake","Which is that we have a couple of opposing things going on this quarter.","Ken Usdin","Understood, okay and then my second question is, it was nice to see the card revenues on the fee side and the revenue capture rate moves towards the way you've been saying, it actually eclipsed the 10.5 you had said for the year already. Can you just help us understand like how we turn the corner then on card income and your expectations for that going forward? Thanks.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So obviously one of the biggest drivers over the last recent while in card revenues has been the extraordinary success we've had in capturing new Chase Sapphire Reserve accounts. And so the end of third quarter, but importantly both the fourth quarter and the first quarter were extraordinary in terms of the number of accounts we acquired and of course we amortized or contra revenue out those expenses over one year.","So at 10.5% revenue rate right now and with those having adjusted the premium with those originations stabilizing out into the second quarter, we will see ultimately will lap that impact a year from now and will see our revenue rates that are improving from here towards 11.25% that we sort of guided to in the medium term and we expect to get to that point all other things being equal kind of mid next year.","And of course that is one facet, we\u2019re also seeing significant momentum on the sales front, obviously as a result of those accounts we're growing core loans 8% and so we're having higher NII on those balances. So there's a lot of dry powder. We just need to get past these account acquisition costs, which we will. And I was still compelled to point out that these are extraordinarily good customers, their characteristic, their engagement, their spend, these are the customers that everybody wants to acquire. We now have them and we intend to deepen relationships with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks. Hey two questions, one on M&A strategy, there was some discussion that maybe you were interested in acquiring something that's not really the question to comment on that specific rumor, but more in this regulatory environment and the changes that we've had already, do you feel like there is a little more flexibility for your strategic actions or outlook than maybe a year ago?","Marianne Lake","So I would characterize our strategy as unchanged. We've always been pretty consistent over an extended period that we would prioritize first and foremost strategic investments for growth in our businesses be that organic or otherwise.","And obviously you've seen us reinvesting, whether it's in growing loans or introducing new products, hiring bankers, opening offices in our expansion markets and the like. But yes, it's been heavily skewed to being organic over the most recent while. We've also been pretty clear and active I would say in terms of partnering with, investing in, collaborating with partners that can accelerate our growth potential.","So we would always be interested, whether that's FinTech or otherwise in getting capabilities that allow us to accelerate to our growth potential. We don't have big gaps, but we would always be interested in that. Having said that, I'm not going to comment on the size of the regulatory environment except to say you should expect for any of these events or transactions will have the appropriate regulators that we have conversation with regulators at the appropriate time.","Betsy Graseck","Second question is on a little bit of a ticky-tacky but on FASB. They're working on changing some of the hedge accounting rules and I wondered how you're thinking about areas in your balance sheet. You might be able to utilize that in a way that makes your business more efficient, I don't know if that's something that you're thinking about?","Marianne Lake","Yes, so obviously we are supportive of the new hedge accounting rules and it will allow us to consider taking advantage of hedge accounting a wider set of products than we currently do, but we actually have reasonably limited hedge in effect in our P&L right now. So from a practical perspective, it won\u2019t make a big difference to the business, but it is more flexibility in terms of the scope and we\u2019re looking at that.","Jamie Dimon","I would just add as a policy matter, we make economic decisions not accounting decisions. So accounting is a fiction and as Marianne spoke about the credit card, you expensed the acquisition cost over 12 months, the benefit comes over seven years. So we make huge investments all the time based on economics. We will never make a decision based upon accounting and then we'll describe it to our shareholders to understand why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing.","Betsy Graseck","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi, Marianne. I wanted to ask about the credit cards, the outlook for charge-offs remains the same at about below 3% for the year and you are about 3% now in the first half. So maybe you're expecting a little bit of improvement in the back half of the year, is that seasonal?","Marianne Lake","Yes, it\u2019s seasonality. So you see in the first half around that guidance level, we would expect that to go down slightly from seasonality in the second half or full year a bit below 3.","John McDonald","And then at Investor Day, the outlook for the medium-term was not much higher 3 to 3.25, does that allow for the seasoning over the next year or two of all the growth that you've had and allow for some normalization too, is that enough cushion to get all that in there?","Marianne Lake","So, I would say obviously any time you reach an inflection point you need to be cautious about understanding the pace of change for at least for 2018 3 to 3.5 feels right. I think when you get beyond that we'll be updating you with our views as we experience that more in reality, it doesn't feel significantly different from that. But I think 2018 is a good number and 2019 we'll update you.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. I just wanted to follow up to the questions that Glenn and Ken had on margin. Marianne, could you give us a little bit of insight on how deposit rate has trended wholesale versus retail during the quarter? And also just going back to your comments, if the Fed balance sheet reduction drives wholesale deposits out of the system, can we assume that, that should not affect deposit rate negatively for JPMorgan?","Marianne Lake","Yes, okay. So just talk about what we've seen so far I think the industry has been really quite disciplined, which is what we would have expected at this early stage of a normalization in terms of the rate cycle. It is a tale of two cities. We said this quarter, the wholesale price necessarily experiences higher reprice more quickly and we are seeing that pretty much in line with our expectations. It matches; you need to get granular, the type of deposits that planned segmentation it matches, so in wholesale price we are seeing it, we\u2019re on that journey. ","In the retail space we haven't seen that yet. So while there have been small changes in the industry in CDs there is nothing in checking or savings, but again I'll just point out to you that we wouldn\u2019t have expected that to be disciplined yet in the cycle. And I would say with respect to deposit basis and the Fed balance sheet if we are right and we believe will be close to right and that we see the wholesale non-operating deposits flowing out of the system assuming everybody else has reached the same conclusion then it shouldn\u2019t really materially impact the liquidity position of financial institutions. And if you couple that with the expectation of a very gradual and measured pace which gives people a lot of time and opportunity to plan accordingly, we wouldn't expect there to be a significant impact on basis if any.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And my second question, you mentioned in the beginning of the call that standardized will ultimately be your CET 1 binding constraints. And I'm wondering if you were allowed to flowed off your current off risk floor and I think it\u2019s a $400 billion. Does that mean standardize is your constraint that being able to floor it off the floor and model out your off risk, may not be an incremental source of capital because standardized is binding?","Marianne Lake","Yes, I would say, first of all I would say focusing on any one, so we will be very supportive of changes to how operation of the capital is treated under rate capital rules, but I think focusing on one facet and not the whole thing is unlikely to be the only one thing changes. So we'd like to see changes made over time, but for the foreseeable future as we are growing our loans quite strongly and these are extraordinarily high quality loans where the differential between advanced and standardized is quite big, we still expect standardized to bind us.","Jamie Dimon","And I should point out the standardized were 100% in United States, in Europe we're talking about 75%. So there will be some changes over time in how well these capital ratios get calculated for international competitiveness reasons.","Marianne Lake","Yes, so whether it's because the operational risk will change or whether it\u2019s because the standardized rules become at least somewhat more risk sensitive there should be changes over time, but I think for the foreseeable future this is what we expect.","Operator","Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning. First question is on Commercial Banking, can you just comment a bit on the sustainability of the growth in profitability, you've had this your earnings are up 30% year-on-year, loan growth C&I 9%, CRE up 15% and we're not talking about small numbers anymore. I think your loan book now is about $200 billion in commercial banking and can you just talk about some of the initiatives that you've discussed that the middle market the BIB, and how sustainable that is, and whether, how whether you're comfortable with the risk profile of the book you have there because you are growing quickly? It is a big book now and you're certainly growing faster than the industry. ","Marianne Lake","Yes, so I would, I will start with if you go back a couple of years ago 2013, 2014, 2015 when we were doing our business simplification agenda and derisking and uplifting the controlled environment in the Commercial Bank was blocking and tackling and doing a lot. We were really focused and we talked, I think all the way back in 2015 that there were outbound calls, opening offices, hiring bankers and if you waited a minute you'd see that come into our results and this is sort of fruits of that labor. So I do think it is sustainable. There's nothing in these results that is particularly noisy outside of reserve releases, which I'll come back to.","I would also say the partnership between the Commercial Bank and the IB in terms of covering our clients, the introduction of 16 specialized industries, which is an advantage we can bring to our clients nationally and in fact globally the other competitors can\u2019t bring, all of those things sets us up for continued solid growth.","With respect to loan growth, I would say if you look at our C&I loans this quarter as an example was pretty broad based. There wasn't a specific in the middle market that wasn't a specific industry or market segment that was strong, but over the last - stronger, I should say, but over the last few years, a lot of our growth has been driven by the investments we've been making in the expansion markets. ","So we got into the new markets with the WaMu acquisition. We continue to build out those markets, add bankers, open offices and that has been a source of growth for us that perhaps others haven't been able to enjoy and also, as I said, specialized industry and then\u2026 ","Jamie Dimon","That is what we said, I think we're in all major 50 markets now unlike retail or one day we will embark an expansion in cities we're not in and the products set is just fabulous. We're adding more and more online things. We're adding simpler and faster credit approvals. We're adding, making it easier to do merchant processing when you sign up for middle market loans. The online systems are great. So all that stuff I think this is going to grow over a long period of time. And thanks for pointing out how well it did. I hope that you are listening congratulations.","Saul Martinez","Yes, no problem.","Marianne Lake","The only thing I would say on commercial real estate just because I think it's really important is, commercial real estate it depends what you do and more than half of our commercial real estate closure is commercial term lending. It's a very specific strategy. We don\u2019t deviate from that strategy and I would just point you because it was interesting to me, if you look at the Feds CCAR stress results the commercial real estate across the industry and look at how our results compared to others, I think you can hopefully get somewhat more comfortable and we are very comfortable with what we have right now. Now that said, the [indiscernible] did benefit from reserve releases and benign credit and at some point there will be a cycle, but the risk appetite we have in the way we have managed with discipline, we are very happy with that.","Jamie Dimon","And the IB, brining JPMorgan investment banking to Chase corporate clients we still think there's a long way to go.","Saul Martinez","That\u2019s great. Thank you. If I can follow up with a bigger picture question and Jamie, you've been, correct me if I'm wrong, you've been pretty vocal about believing that the underpinnings of our economy are healthy and strong and not buying into the whole secular stagnation argument, but at what point does political dysfunction and political paralysis really start to dent that confidence and because you've also indicated that we do need structural reform to lift trend growth, whether it's infrastructure cash from whatever it is, and can you just comment on that? And I guess, as an adjunct to that, what are your conversations with clients like, is there a risk that is materializing that clients are also starting to become more frustrated with the lack of progress politically?","Jamie Dimon","I would look at it the other way around. So we've - since the great recession okay, which is now eight years old, we've been growing 1.5% to 2% in spite of stupidity and political gridlock because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless. From to wake up in the morning, the want to feed their kids, they want to buy a home, they want to do things. It's the same with American businesses, might what I'm saying is that it will be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and we were not gridlocked.","And thank you for pointed it out because I'm going to be a broken record until this gets done. We are unable to build bridges, we're unable to build airports or industries. School kids are not graduating. You know, I was just in France. I was recently in Argentina. I was in Israel, I was in Ireland. We met with the Prime Minister of India and China. It's amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies that promote business and growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and it's somehow this great American free enterprises and we no longer get it.","And so, my view is that and corporate taxation is critical to that by the way. We've been driving capital and bringing it overseas, which is why this $2 trillion sitting overseas benefiting all these other countries and stuff like that. So if we don't get it, if we don't get our act together we could still grow, obviously it\u2019s unfortunate but it\u2019s hurting us.","It\u2019s hurting the body of politics, it\u2019s hurting the average American that we don't have these right policies and so no, in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1.5% to 2%. I don\u2019t buy the argument that we'll relegate this forever, we\u2019re not. And you know if this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure regulatory reform we have become the most one of most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet.","It's almost an embarrassment being an American citizen travelling around the world and listening to the stupid shit we have to deal with in this country. And you know at one point we all have to get our act together or we will do what we're supposed to do to the average Americans. And unfortunately people write about the things like it\u2019s for corporations. It\u2019s not for corporations, competitive taxes are important for business and business growth, which is important for jobs and wage growth. And honestly, we should be winging that along, but every single one of you every time you talk to clients.","Marianne Lake","And then I would just say that in terms of how our clients are behaving and how the dialogue is going, whether you look at middle market, you Corporate Banking, M&A it\u2019s not to say that the possibilities of reform and the impacts that could have isn't a part of the dialogue, but they are fundamentally really just getting on with things and services. The client has a compelling strategic deal to be done or some spending or hiring or growth then they are pretty much getting on with it, which is why we\u2019re seeing solid growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","You guys obviously had a very big approval for share buybacks on the latest CCAR here and I just wanted your thoughts on terms of using it all given where your stock price is, given loan growth has slowed a tad and given the flatter yield curve mix buying securities is less interesting, how do you put that all together?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So look, obviously you know the deal with CCAR people which is capacity is not necessarily a commitment to utilize it although we are as we fairly clearly articulated at our Investor Day and as you see in the numbers here, that we are at 12.5% in terms of our CET 1 and we believe we ought to be able to over time operate the company lower than that within the range of 11% to 12.5% albeit that we will take time to do that.","So we're in the market buying our stock every day, you know we're at 1.8 times value you saw in gaining shareholder assets. We still think that there is significant value in the stock. We believe in the earnings power and the franchise that we have here. And so not to say that we would utilize all the capacity because other things can come up, but we've put in the request based upon our desire to want to ultimately move lower.","Jamie Dimon","Yes and this is very important policy issues here too. So our preference is always to build organically, to not buyback stock, but to build branches and grow and lend more. But there's an argument that people are making that banks can't lend it and even if there is excess lending capabilities, they wouldn\u2019t have done it and that is not true.","The counterfactual would have been that if banks can freely use their capital and their liquidity five years ago, they would have been a lot more lenient in the system. And that we pointed out two areas where it would have taken place, one is mortgages where regulators have held back lending to first-time buyers, immigrants, self-employed, buyer defaults, et cetera and the second is small business, whereas it\u2019s not existing small businesses, think of the start-up small businesses and that they are having a hard time getting capital maybe at community bank level et cetera. The counterfactual would have been that $1 trillion or $2 trillion would have been lent out had these rules been changed five years ago. That is the counterfactual. It\u2019s not that, well the banks wouldn\u2019t have lent the money. And so again, there is a false notion that all this didn\u2019t hold back the economy, yes it did.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you, good morning Marianne.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, how are you?","Gerard Cassidy","Good. Can you give us some color Federal Reserve Chairwomen Yellen indicated that she sees that there could be some relief on the horizon for the banks and one of the areas that's been talked about is change in the calculation of the SLR. If you guys modelled out what that could do to your SLR and then how that may change your view on capital going forward, if there are changes where for example, they take the cash sitting that's sitting at the central banks out of the equation?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So obviously, they haven't been specific although the Treasury report had some ideas. They haven\u2019t been specific about what the calibration would look like and whether there would be recalibration to the numeric and the denominator or one or the other. Clearly, we've been pretty clear that we think cash at central banks shouldn't necessarily be included and there are other things, different people have different opinions, so we've done the calculations.","I would just point you back to the fact that we have some 20 potentially binding constraints right now of which leveraging a variety of forms is part of that, so to the degree that we get the opportunity to recalibrate that, it could have impact on the margin, but we take all of those things into consideration when we think about the direction of travel of the company. So we\u2019re being as social as we can. We're not specifically leverage constrained right now that doesn't mean we're not supportive of making those changes and we will obviously model it out. But we take the potential for those changes into consideration when we think about the direction we grow our businesses.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then as a followup, coming back to credit cards, obviously the Sapphire has been a huge success in growing your business there. The acquisition costs higher today than when you compare them to maybe two or three years ago and in that vein, when you guys look at the economics of putting on new cards is the net present value or whatever measure you use to determine the economics has that improved, stayed the same or weakened from maybe a year or two ago?","Marianne Lake","So I think, I want to point out something because I know the Sapphire reserve gets a significant amount of attention for obvious and good reasons, but it is only one product in a platform of successful products both proprietary and co-brand. And so in reality, while we obviously do all the modeling and the math it is not about what the cost of any one individual card acquired is or the NPV about how the portfolios ultimately together could perform over time and it's still very early on Sapphire reserve. I mean it\u2019s not even a year old yet and these are portfolios and products that develop and season over time and as I said these are extraordinary good customer relationships.","So you know, we've done a bunch of things in the card business over the last few years. We've renegotiated our co-brands that was ultimately with lower economics, but still very good economics. We\u2019ve been out on the front foot issuing new products, not just Sapphire reserve, but Freedom Unlimited, the Amazon Prime Card, Inc. And so we think about everything in the total portfolio and its collective performance over time and its still generating very good returns.","Jamie Dimon","I just mentioned about the regulatory SLRs, so looking at it very broadly, if you look at - it's not just capital liquidity but mortgage rules, requirements, capital liquidity collateral rules, where collateral can be used and not used. If these things were just calibrated differently, the cost of credit will go down, swap prices go down, mortgage will become more available, the cost of mortgage will come down and those are kind of important in total if they\u2019re done right and without changing at all the rest of the system in fact the system is healthier, if the economy is healthier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Chubak of Nomura Instinet.","Steve Chubak ","Hi, good morning. So Marianne, I wanted to start off with sort of with a question on liquidity. You spoke of how the Fed balance sheet unwind should have little impact on your LCR, but just given the strength of your liquidity position and the significant excess reserves that you have at the Fed how should we be thinking about the current capacity to deploy some of that excess into higher yielding MBS and maybe what is your appetite to redeploy just given some of the tougher liquidity treatment for Agency MBS in particular?","Marianne Lake","So when we think about the liquidity position of this company we\u2019re obviously managing not just regulatory requirements but also to what we will ultimate duration of equity and position of our balance sheet to be through the cycles. So if you take into consideration not just the amount of liquidity we have and how that could be utilized, but also the mortgage portfolio, we have agency MBS. So all of that goes into our determination and we will continue to add to duration opportunistically when it makes sense to do it and manage our balance sheet with discipline.","Steve Chubak ","Okay, understood. And then just one more question from me, just on capital targets. I appreciate all the detail Marianne you provided indicating that over time there could be a path or trajectory towards getting to the lower end of that 11% to 12.5% range. I'm just wondering, given the very favorable CCAR results we saw this year coupled with some of the Treasury reforms have been outlined, is there the potential for you to actually manage to a target even below that 11% especially if gold-plating surcharges impact goes away?","Marianne Lake","Yes so I would, I would start by saying that a lot can change between now and the next cycle of CCAR or the next two cycles of CCAR and so we never did actually say that we necessarily wanted to get below into the range, but operate for the short to medium term within the range, while we let all of the potential changes to the sort of regulatory environment with large play out.","And so, as to whether or not over time there is a sort of recalibration of whether 11% is on minimum that will play out over time. So for the next one or two cycles of CCAR this cycle and the next one I would just expect that we want to be on a measured pace to be within the range to allow us to better understand all of the changes that will take place over time and make appropriate decisions. I wouldn't start imagining necessarily how low that goes, I think we would want to operate with sufficiency of capital and liquidity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lim of SocGen.","Andrew Lim","Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. Just coming back to the Treasury's proposals for the new calculation of the SLR can you give any color as to whether that's actually even possible within the glib context as to how the Basel Committee and wouldn\u2019t want harmonization across the whole world. And of course if it did happen, then you\u2019d have a massive advantage along with other U.S. banks versus other European investment banks.","Marianne Lake","So I would say of course it is possible. We've seen a number of situations where implementing global standards in the U.S. have deferred in meaningful ways from how they've been implemented elsewhere. You have rarely seen that B2B advantage of the U.S. and the SLR is no exception. So while that maybe recalibrations of either the numerator or denominator, you know, know that to the European 3% standard are current depositary institutions are held with 6% standard. So there's plenty of room for there to be adjustments before it would create an unlevel playing field.","And my suspicion is there would also be adjustments elsewhere and it's supposed to be as I think Jamie Dimon said a backdrop not binding in the way that it has become. So I think the answer is yes, but we will see.","Jamie Dimon","Okay, the key point Marianne said is almost every single thing that's been done in America added to Basel requirements, the gold plating, SLR, calculation of LCR, calculation of stress, GSIB, almost every single thing. And remember America doesn't have to listen to Basel either, and you may, we may have noticed that basically France, Germany, India, China, all time Basel they better take a deep breath and stop doing it more with what they\u2019re doing.","Andrew Lim","Great, thanks. And just a followup question also on the reduction in the Op risk and I mean you talked about advances for standardized funds, I mean, looking at the CCAR your SLRs are binding constraint that isn\u2019t that really a moot argument, a none argument really as to whether that happens or not, i.e. if you reduce your Op risk it doesn't really change your excess capital?","Marianne Lake","So, look there are a number of different people talking about the forward-looking standard for operational risk, Basel under Basel\u2019s 3.5 or 4 or whatever is talking about there were some proposals in the choice act. So there's no question that there should be a re-visitation of the mechanisms to calculate operational risk and then you're right, the way that all of these will ultimately interplay with each other matters and so from a pure stress test perspective, at the margin, we had a little bit more binding constraint on leverage than CET 1.","But if you look at just what, what we could run the company at if CCAR was the only constraint it would be lower than where we are. So, it's a complicated dynamic of trying to make sure that we are maximizing against all of these constraints and not just the mathematical ones, but also the operational and practical ones. So I mean, it\u2019s necessary to go back and rethink the calculation of operational risk just because it's the right thing to do and ultimately how that plays out into how we optimize against our constraint is less of what we focus on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Oh hey, just two other quick things, one on the accounting with hedged just to get back on it will affect the question also was, was there any opportunity for your clients too because if there is an opportunity for say institutions to hedge their books of business more that could feed into your revenues?","Marianne Lake","I wouldn't imagine. It is not going to change our risk management strategy in a meaningful way, so, I would imagine it would be...","Jamie Dimon","The [indiscernible] corporations. The new hedging rules will affect other corporate or non-banks.","Betsy Graseck","Yes, in the sense that you can potentially hedge your commodity risk, so wouldn\u2019t that be something?","Jamie Dimon","We haven't looked at whether it creates more demand from the corporate sides, we'll look at that Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Yes, okay. And then, is there a timeframe here where you have to start telling us what your LCR is? I wasn't sure if that was coming up soon was that this quarter or next quarter or is just been put on hold?","Marianne Lake","No, it is still this quarter and there are requirements to make public disclosures in August, so depending on whether you make them in your Q, in your pillar 3 or not will determine whether it's the beginning or middle or end of August. We as you know have as an industry being quite public about the fact that we think - by the way we provide an extraordinary amount of real time granular, same day granular information on the liquidity [indiscernible] in order for them to be able to properly supervise not just after the system.","And so, we believe the regulators do have and can have anything they need when they need it. It's just a question about whether there is any added benefit of those information being made public, near real-time. While it wouldn't matter today, when everyone is running very significant liquidity surpluses it could have unintended consequences if we\u2019re in an environment that was more stressful than we are today. So, right now the requirement is that we have to disclose, I suspect although we've asked for a delay as an industry that we might have to disclose, we will continue to debate, I think with regulators the merits of those public disclosures over time.","Betsy Graseck","I guess that, I'm just thinking that there is the opportunity to show us the non-operating deposits going away, which would help people understand the strength of deposit franchise?","Marianne Lake","Yes and I mean, I would suggest although it's not something we tell you every quarter that we've been pretty forthcoming about showing you the level of our deposits and the split, at least Investor Day now and then between operating and non-operating deposits and as we start to see the impact of the Fed balance sheet unwind in the light, we will \u2013 we will be very forthcoming. We tried to be incredibly transparent and we will take that under advisement regardless of what the regulatory disclosures are about the quality of our deposit franchise. But we have I think periodically been more to disclosed this than most in terms of the quality of our deposits.","Jamie Dimon","You could see that we have $500 billion of cash, $300 billion of securities, $300 billion of repo, I mean this is a pretty liquid company. The liquid is any bank I have ever seen on this planet.","Marianne Lake","And we have moved $200 billion of non-operating deposits proactively, so we manage it very carefully.","Jamie Dimon","Yes there is nothing, what happened because of all this reflects JPMorgan much and the very important LCR is not, it doesn't affect us. We're fine disclosing whether they want to disclose. It's an issue of whether the monetary, whether it is good for monetary policy and will it cause a problem, not for us, for the system when there's a crisis. Like do they want banks to use the liquidity or not, very simple because the answer is you've got to maintain over 100% then you can\u2019t use your liquidity that's what it means. And so, they said publicly, some have said there is quite legal below 100 and we're saying well, what bank is going to be the first to go 100. And so it\u2019s kind of a policy issue. Whatever happens, we're completely fine at JPMorgan. If I were the regulators, I wouldn't want to put myself in that kind of a position.","Operator","And we have no further questions.","A - Marianne Lake","Thank you.","Jamie Dimon","Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be mute for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page one and taking a look at the quarter, we had strong performance in each of our businesses despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions. And bringing it altogether, this quarter\u2019s result was clean with no significant items and with the Firm reporting net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of a $1.58, and the return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.5 billion of revenue.","Highlights of the quarter include the highest reported revenue for third quarter in the CIB with IB fees up 15% and markets revenues up 33%, with strong performance across the board, robust core loan growth for the Company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses, and the continuation of strong credit performance including a net release for oil and gas. Card sales are back to double-digit growth year-on-year and we saw a strong positive market reaction to new proprietary products. And finally, we had record consumer deposit growth up 11%.","Before I move on, we recently submitted our 2016 resolution filing. The Board and management believe that we submitted a credible plan and more than met the requirement for the October submission. It was a tremendous effort across the Company involving all businesses and functions, and we took many significant actions, perhaps most notably improving the Firm\u2019s overall liquidity and prepositioning our material legal entities for both liquidity and capital. We determined this is in the best interest of the Company, albeit at some cost. And we took many other important actions which hopefully you\u2019ve had a chance to review in our public filings.","Moving back to the quarter, moving on to page two, revenue of $25.5 billion was up $2 billion year-on-year or up 8%. On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter. Non-interest revenue was up $1.3 billion driven by strong performance in the CIB. Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by two notable expense items in consumer, which I\u2019ll talk about later, as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge which took effect this quarter and some higher marketing expense. Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes consumer reserve build of $225 million, primarily card, but against that we have a net reserve release in wholesale for oil and gas of about $50 million.","So, as I said, net income was $6.3 billion and while down 8% year-on-year, you will recall that there were a number of significant items in last year\u2019s results, most notably significant tax benefit. If you adjust for tax, legal expenses and credit reserves, net income is up over $800 million year-on-year.","Dealing with oil and gas here, we\u2019re encouraged by how quickly investor sentiment and risk appetite for the sector returned as the outlook for both oil and gas prices continued to improve. Capital market opened more broadly to these clients and we experienced lower draws against our facilities than previously anticipated.","So, a combination of pay downs opportunistic loan sales and select upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. If the environment remains broadly consistent with today, we would not expect further significant builds in the fourth quarter for energy.","Moving to page three and capital, key takeaways from this page, capital and leverage ratios were broadly flat quarter-on-quarter with the CET1 ratio of 11.9%, as net capital generation was offset by strong loan and commitment growth. Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth, as well as liability action taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets. While HQLA was up $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, our liquid assets were up significantly more than that. As I said liquidity at the bank is not included in reported HQLA. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion of net capital to shareholders including $2.1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share.","Moving onto page four and consumer and community banking. Consumer and community banking generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16%. We continued to experience record deposit growth more than twice the industry average, up 11% year-on-year. More than half of that growth is from existing customers. And based on the FDIC survey for 2016, we were number one in absolute growth and grew share in each of our top 30 markets. Core loan growth remained strong at 19%. And while it\u2019s primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in auto, 9% in business banking and 7% in card loans.","Card new account originations were up 35% with strong demand for Sapphire Reserve and Freedom Unlimited and with more than three quarters of new accounts being opened through digital channels. Card sales volume was up double-digit this quarter and we expect share gains to accelerate.","So to close on drivers, we saw merchant processing volumes up 13% and our active mobile customer base up 17%. Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 4% year-on-year. Consumer and business banking revenue was also up 4% on the back of strong deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high quality loans to our portfolio.","Card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was down 1% as a strong momentum in card and auto volumes and balance growth was offset by higher card origination cost and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations. And while the new account origination costs do cause a near-term drag on revenues, it\u2019s a high cost problem to have as we expect these accounts will be strongly accretive over time.","Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenues for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter-on-quarter on higher acquisition costs but it will clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated. Expense of $6.5 billion is up year-on-year, as I said, driven by two notable items, totaling a $175 million as well as the increased FDIC surcharge. The first item relates to liabilities assumed for a merchant in bankruptcy and the second is a modest increase in reserve for mortgage servicing. Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth which is in line with investor day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency.","Finally, the credit environment remains favorable. In cards, we built $200 million of reserve this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio including newer vintages which have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans. And in auto, we built $25 million of reserves on the back of high quality loan growth.","Now, turning to page five and the corporate and investment bank. Total revenues of CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IB fees on record for third quarter too, up 15% with strong market performance across the board, revenues up 33%. Expense was down 20% year-on-year on lower legal costs but also with strong expense discipline more broadly. Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for oil and gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter.","Diving deeper, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year-over-year with strong performance across products. We ranked number one in Global IB fees maintaining share on a year-to-date basis, and ranked number one in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were up 8% year-over-year and we continued to rank number two globally and have done more deals than anyone else so far this year.","In equity underwriting, fees were 38% year-on-year. With the stable market backdrop and strong investor demand, issuance was up across products and particularly in IPOs. We ranked number one in wallet globally and in North America and EMEA and we also ranked number one on a number of deals basis for overall ECM and IPOs.","Debt underwriting had the highest third quarter on record with strong market-wide bond issuance, record high grade bond supply in August and yields near record lows. Fees were 12% from a high watermark last year and we ranked number one.","In terms of outlook, given the strength this quarter, we expect IB fees to be down in the fourth quarter sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year. Markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 33% year-on-year. Clients were active and risk management conditions were favorable. Fixed income revenue was up 48% compared to a weaker third quarter last year. Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as markets stayed active post Brexit with good client flow, as well as anticipation of an uncertainty around central bank actions. Currencies in emerging markets matched a very strong third quarter last year but was slowed down slightly. And credit and securitized products came back from a weak prior period with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market making and new issuance environment resulting in a particularly strong quarter.","Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year with Asia matching last year\u2019s strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volume. Taking treasury services and security services revenues together, each were over $900 million with strong forward pipelines and levers to higher rates.","Moving on to page six and commercial banking. Commercial banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year, driven by a trifecta of NII on loan growth, higher deposit spreads, as well as higher IB revenues.","Loan growth continues to be strong across both C&I and CRE, outperforming the industry. C&I loans were up 10% year-on-year, despite competition for quality loans as the investments that we\u2019ve been making this year are delivering results. We\u2019ve added over a 100 net new bankers, opened seven new offices and further built out our specialized industry coverage. And we\u2019ve added nearly 600 new relationships in middle market this year.","CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. We\u2019re also seeing stable to improving new loan spreads. IB revenue was up 57%, in part driven by a few large transactions but bringing year-to-date IB revenues closer to flat versus last year, which is a strong performance. Expense growth of 4% is driven by our investments. And as I said, these investments are already paying off. Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by oil and gas. In addition, you see further reserve releases for oil and gas here as I mentioned earlier. Outside of energy, credit quality is good and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter.","Leaving the commercial bank and moving on to asset management on page seven. Asset management reported net income of $557 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads. Expense to $2.1 billion was up slightly year-on-year and up 2% sequentially on higher incentive compensation. We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi assets including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter, as well as inflows and alternatives in fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products.","In addition, we were the beneficiary of the $22 billion of liquidity flow this quarter, capturing more than our share of many in motion given money market reform. AUM grew 4% and overall client assets 5% to $1.8 trillion and $2.4 trillion respectively driven by market as well as long-term flows. Our long-term investment performance remained solid with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $114 billion, up 5% year-on-year, driven by mortgage.","Skipping over page eight and corporate where the results were very close to home and where there are no significant items to highlight, so turning to page nine and the outlook. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter-on-quarter on continued strength in loan growth, even as we digest the incremental cost of resolution based liquidity actions, which will be pulling in our run rate in the fourth quarter. Expect non-interest revenues to be down quarter-on-quarter based upon our current outlook for IB fees and assuming flat year-on-year markets revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages. All else equal, expect NII to come in at $50.5 billion plus or minus for the full year, market dependent. Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year-on-year, bringing full year expense in at approximately $56 billion consistent with our guidance and self funding the consumer items I mentioned.","So to wrap up, strong performance whichever you look at to this quarter. We\u2019re continuing to demonstrate that our operating models and our platform is working for our clients, that our scale across businesses gives us operating leverage and that our investments through time are paying off. And while as a Company, we are proud of this quarter\u2019s performance and in particular proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance.","With that, operator, please open up the line and we can take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Audio Gap] from CLSA.","Marianne Lake","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Can you talk about the competitive environment in capital markets? I mean, you had a strong growth. Is that due to better markets, better share or both?","Marianne Lake","So, I think there is three things -- three or four things to mention. The first is that I would say that the industry generally had a pretty weak third quarter last year. And so, when you think about the year-over-year comparison, we are little flattered by last year\u2019s performance, not necessarily more so than our peers but nevertheless we are. And then, we talked about the fact that this quarter the conditions were relatively favorable broadly and compare and contrast that last year where there were pockets of activity in client flow but there were also pockets where people were really sitting on their hands and not transacting. So, I think client flow quite broadly across the environment would characterize the quarter.","In terms of the competitive performance, I would say it feels like we did well. Obviously we\u2019re the first to report, apart from Citi this morning. It feels like we did relatively well. So, we may have gained some share, certainly, hopefully the momentum in terms of the business we\u2019ve been building in the way we are serving our clients, will serve us in that capacity, not just this quarter but through time. But obviously that can be a bit of volatility in the market share space. So, we prefer to look at it more through time and we feel pretty good about the performance.","Mike Mayo","Specifically versus the European banks, so are you looking to use your balance sheet more to gain share?","Marianne Lake","So, I would say, we don\u2019t specifically target a competitive set to -- but, I will tell you that our balance sheet, we talked about it many times on this call before, that we do have the capacity to put our balance sheet and our resources to work for our clients, for our best clients and we think about using those resources in the context of overall relationship. So, if any peer is more leverage constrained and has less access, we may have competitive advantage. And certainly, we will continue to make those resources available to our clients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.","Marianne Lake","Hi Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. I\u2019m curious on card delinquencies picking up. I know you\u2019ve been guiding towards that but when you see, it is the only part of credit that has anything but great trends. You mentioned on your comments newer vintages will have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average. Do you mind just drilling down a little bit more color on what exactly is driving that; is that going down credit a little bit or is that just expected season, as you thought?","Marianne Lake","So, I don\u2019t know Glenn if you recall, we had a bit of discussion about this last quarter and sort of guided to the fact that we would expect to see our loss rates go up slowly, I mean partly because obviously 250ish basis points, I think we could call that pretty low historically. But also because over the course of the last couple of years, we have been changing the mix of our originations a bit to the prime, near prime space and still completely within our credit risk appetite and at risk-adjusted margins that are better than the portfolio average. So, we\u2019re getting paid for that. So, we are doing it within our risk appetite doing it judiciously. But as a result, as those vintages become a higher percentage of our overall population, they will have a gentle upward pressure on the charge-off rate.","So, what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the delinquency uptick and the charge-off gradual increases completely in line with how we underwrote those loans and our expectations. And so, as you look forward for us over the course for the next several quarters and we would expect those phenomena to generally continue again slowly, we\u2019re growing our portfolio, we\u2019re going to see the seasoning of those vintages as the mix increases and as they become more seasoned, cause us to build a reserve but for the right reason.","Glenn Schorr","Fair enough. Just one follow-up if I could get a just a high level comment on has anything materially changed in terms of rate or curve sensitivity as you remix the portfolio and as you\u2019re getting all this great loan growth? I\u2019m just curious on current positioning.","Marianne Lake","No, nothing significant, Glenn. No significant changes to our sensitivity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I had a question on the Card strategy. And I know -- we all know that you\u2019ve created the closed loop and you\u2019re using that in part, it seems to drive really efficient pricing in the marketplace on the credit card products. What I am obviously seeing is an increase in share on card issuance; you\u2019re taking some nice share in the merchant space as well. I just want to understand what the goal is and how far you\u2019re willing to push this market share versus ROA, ROE.","Marianne Lake","So, I would say that all of the things that you mentioned whether it\u2019s closed loop network, whether it\u2019s our new proprietary products whether it\u2019s our investments in the technology platform and the business merchant services are all at good returns that ultimately will drive the business to be profitable in the future as it has been in the past. So, we haven\u2019t given specific guidance for ROE part of this business but nothing has changed over the medium term for what we think that the performance of the business would be.","Betsy Graseck","So, is it fair to suggest that part of the market share improvement here is coming from some give-up of profitability? And the underlying question is really how much market share do you want in this business? You are already at 18% to 22% market share of the credit card space, depending on which numbers you want to use.","Marianne Lake","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a very competitive business and it\u2019s very profitable. So, all other things being equal, we would like to continue to gain share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Marianne, just wondering, you mentioned that part of the increase in consumer cost this quarter was planned investments and that you\u2019re continuing to self fund. I am just wondering as you think forward and we get past this good gear that you\u2019ve had, will that be kind of underlying expectation for you guys, again with the understanding that the revenue environment will always take things up or down; but do you have an aspiration that you can continue to keep costs flat?","Marianne Lake","So, I mean, look, we haven\u2019t given specific cost guidance going out beyond this year at this point. But our objective will remain consistent with those that we stated previously, which is we continue to try and become more efficient across our businesses. As you know, we\u2019re at the tail end but not finished on a couple of large expense programs in our largest businesses, so that we create capacity to be able to invest in the businesses broadly whether that\u2019s in products and marketing and investment in innovation all of which we\u2019re doing as much as we can as long as we do it well. And so, it\u2019s going to come down to if we think we have investment opportunities that we can execute well that have an appropriate return, we would like to keep doing that. And in order to have the right to do it, we would like to become more and more efficient in our core business operations. So, we haven\u2019t actually given guidance, I think I would characterize it as expenses under control, creating capacity to invest but we will decision investment based upon their merits and obviously explain them to you in the future at Investor Day if not on other venues.","Ken Usdin","And if I can come back to another investment day point from earlier this year, you\u2019d mentioned that you\u2019d felt comfortable with an 11% CET1; you plan to get to your CET1 to 12%; you are at 12.1% now already. Just within the construct of Governor Tarullo\u2019s recent commentary, does 11% still feel like the right time; did you sense anything from the commentary that would change your philosophy around where you\u2019d like to live in that potential comment you made at February to potentially go above 100, if in fact this was the right mechanism?","Marianne Lake","So, first of all, I would say that based upon the speech, and obviously you know that there are still some unanswered questions with respect to specific parts of the proposal, which I\u2019ll come back to. But based upon the speech moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy and using the capital stack add-up using our G-SIB Score and our stress drawdown, actually you would come out with a sort of capital constraint on the CCAR that\u2019s pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum. So in that sense, because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of RWA growth and the curtailment of capital distributions, we\u2019ve actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally bound based on last year\u2019s test by both of those two measures, which is a place we played in for a while. We\u2019ve been -- as we talked about before, we\u2019ve been bound by many constraints, somewhat equally over a period of time and striving to sort of operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value. And I think we think we don\u2019t know obviously how funding or liquidity shock will be incorporated. And in any case, this is not for the 2017 CCAR cycle. So, it\u2019s a whole cycle away from now. And we will be operating in 2017 under the same basic test construct that we have previously. And so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a clear and present danger necessarily that we will be able to look at payout ratios that are above top end of our range. Meanwhile we are at the top end of our range now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just a quick follow-up on FICC in your commentary and maybe a broader -- maybe you can have a broader commentary around how the widening LIBOR or rising LIBOR yields helped your businesses across the board in FICC or anywhere else. Just help us understand how that\u2019s playing through the income statement.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I\u2019ll just -- generally speaking with respect to our rate sensitivity, as I think you know we are most sensitive to the front end of the curve but to IOER and prime. So, we do have LIBOR based assets but also liabilities. Good examples would be commercial loans on the asset side or long-term debt on the liability side but our notational mismatch is not particularly big. And so, as a consequence, impact of LIBOR curve move has been not very significant on our P&L, we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be. I will say that the LIBOR moves were one of the features that our rate business had a perspective around and they got good client flow in and around that trade. And so, it was one of the catalysts, one of many, but one of the catalysts that we point to in terms of ability for rates to monetize flow as we had a lot of client flow around that condition. But I wouldn\u2019t put a number on it for you.","Jim Mitchell","And maybe just a follow-up on deposits; you guys have had very good trends in retail. But on the institutional side, there was quite a bit of flow, looked like as well. Any particular drivers there; was it money market reform helping the flows in institutional or something else?","Marianne Lake","We obviously did get some good inflows, liquidity flows in terms of money market reform into our government funds but we also have been very focused in our other wholesale businesses on continuing to attract operating deposits. And so, as I look at our overall strong deposit growth, I wouldn\u2019t say it was equally but it was pretty much equally wholesale operating and retail deposit growth. So, we feel good about both of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","In light of some of the selling issues over at Wells Fargo, I was just wondering if you\u2019ve thought about reevaluating how you approach the consumer, how you compensate staff; and this was obviously not a JPMorgan specific question, but just for the overall industry I think it\u2019s something that folks are wondering about. There is clearly some stuff that\u2019s black and white that you shouldn\u2019t do but I think we also worry that there might be some gray areas that are somewhat less known. So, just how are you thinking about the way you conduct business and compensate staff in light of what\u2019s going on?","Marianne Lake","So, I might just give for context, remind you or maybe you recall that for a number of years now for a fairly long time,, we\u2019ve been standing up at Investor Day and other venue saying that customer experience is the central tenant for how we think about engaging with all of our clients but certainly our retail clients in the branches. And we\u2019ve been very, very focused on investing in customer experience broadly defined and have made great progress I think in doing that. And also we had talked about the fact that what we are looking for very, very clearly is deep customer relationship engaged customers who want to be primary bank, we want to gather a deeper share of wallet, so balances not necessarily products. And so again, remember saying cross-sell is an outcome, it\u2019s not an objective. And that\u2019s certainly the philosophy with which we have designed our compensation and performance structures for the branches. And we review them regularly, at least annually to make sure that they continue to be aligned with our objectives and again objectives about the engaged relationship with customers, good customer experience in the right product, all the right reasons the right way.","And so, as we think about those objectives and how we\u2019ve designed our plan and as we look inward not just and obviously because of the news now but also regularly in our BAU capacity, we feel like our plans are designed to incent those behaviors.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Just a question on back to CIB, you had a slide during Investor Day that showed a walk to $19 billion of expenses by 2017. If some of the factors that you mentioned that drove revenues into CIB higher repeat for 2017; is that $19 billion number still achievable or I guess a better way to ask it, will any incremental revenue uplift from here fall to the bottom-line?","Marianne Lake","So, obviously, first of all, I would say we are on -- I\u2019ll tell you, we are on track with respect to the commitments that Daniel made to you to deliver over time the $2.8 billion of expense saves. While we are not finished yet, we are substantially through that program. So, it\u2019s moved from being a plan through execution to being in the later stages of execution. So, we feel very good about that which means that all other things equal that $19 billion is still a reasonable level of expense target. However, obviously we pay for performance. And so, clearly, if we have significant outperformance next year relative to our expectations at the time of setting those plans, there would be some variable costs associated with it. But for every dollar of outperformance, the variable cost may not always be the same. Obviously, it also depends upon the mix and the payout ratios and all those sorts of things. But a large, large portion of it would be -- it would be obviously as you know incredibly accretive because we will be leveraging all of our scale. So, the only variable cost would really be comped largely.","Erika Najarian","And just as a follow-up to that -- a follow-up to Ken\u2019s question actually. He mentioned the stress capital buffer. Outside of the static balance sheet and capital distribution offset, is there an element to this in terms of just getting better at the test that you could do to reduce that stress capital buffer without actually taking risk down significantly?","Marianne Lake","So, first of all, based upon last year\u2019s results for us, we are at the flow for the stress floor for the stress capital buffer, not to suggest by the way that we wouldn\u2019t continue to want to properly understand and better understand how we can through time make sure that we are performing the best we can on the stress within our risk appetite. So, we are at that floor right now. So, within those home strengths, what we\u2019re trying to be, within our risk appetite manage risk properly, but also add shareholder value. We have to carry that capital anyway. So, we would want to use it, but use well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.","Tim Hayes","Hi. This is Tim Hayes for Paul Miller. Can you give any color on your outlook for margin throughout 2017? To me, fed commentary suggests that rates could remain low and potentially hover around these levels over the next 12 months. So, how can we think about your NIM in that type of scenario? And then, what would a December rate hike do for your outlook?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, for your purposes, I\u2019m going to talk about NII; we don\u2019t really manage to NIM, but you can obviously back into it. So, if we ended up in a situation right now where rates are flat throughout all of 2017 which for what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t think is pretty much anyone\u2019s central expectations right now. But if we were rate flat, you\u2019ve seen us grow our core loans and our loan balances pretty strongly, pretty consistently across businesses. And while we may not be able to replicate $0.15 core loan growth forever, certainly we can continue to grow our loans. So on that stuff, mix shift away from securities over time, we should be able to deliver $1.5 billion of incremental NII next year rate flat. You know that if rates are -- if we\u2019re fortunate enough for the right reasons that we see a hike this year, at the end of this year and get the full benefit of that next year it will be higher than that. And you\u2019ve seen our earnings and risk disclosures; they\u2019ve been pretty close to $3 billion number on a 100 basis-point move for a while most of which is front end.","Tim Hayes","Okay, thank you. And then switching gears, your CRE and C&I lending was pretty strong this quarter. And regulators have obviously grown a little bit more cautious on those segments. So, just kind of if you could give any color for your outlook on lending to those segments going forward?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, we\u2019re aware obviously of the riskier types of CRE lending, the types of lending that attract scrutiny and for reasonable reasons considering how they performed in past cycles. We are also mindful of where we are in the cycle and take that into consideration in our underwriting. So, we have and continue to avoid and what I would characterize as the riskier segments and those segments that performed poorly in previous cycles. So, we really stick to our knitting if that\u2019s an American expression, in terms of continuing to do what we\u2019re good at within our risk appetite. And so, if you think about our commercial real estate growth, commercial term lending is about three quarters of our portfolio. And you know that we\u2019re very focused on smaller loan size, Class B, Class C properties with low vacancy rate. So, rent stabilized, supply constraint markets, underwrite to LTVs, good debt service coverage, we look at forward rates and current rents. And so, we really have expertise in a specific niche and we compete on speed and certainty of execution, not on credit and structure. So, we feel pretty good about our exposures and even in the more traditional real estate banking space and we have avoided riskier segments with limited construction lending exposure, home builders, minimal exposure; we\u2019re pretty disciplined about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim.","Eric Wasserstrom","Marianne, at a conference just before the end of the quarter, another bank talked about improving underwriting conditions in the auto lending space, particularly sort of in the mid to lower FICO range. Are you seeing anything similar?","Marianne Lake","So, we are a primarily prime lender in auto. We are the number one prime lender. We actually have the lowest share in sub-prime among the national banks. So, it\u2019s less than 5% of our origination. So, I wouldn\u2019t speak specifically to underwriting in the lower FICO sectors, not where we play at this point.","Eric Wasserstrom","Sure. I think the reference was to below 700, which includes the bottom end of the prime segment, which has been an area of intense competitive focus; I am just wondering if you\u2019ve seen anything in that segment.","Marianne Lake","So, not that I would comment on except for we have recently decided to pull back on 84 months plus term loans on all FICO bands just as where we are in the cycle as we see the risks of that type of lending. So, we continue to calibrate our underwriting but I wouldn\u2019t comment on seeing anything specifically.","Eric Wasserstrom","And is that influencing your reserve expectations for consumer at all?","Marianne Lake","Auto?","Eric Wasserstrom","Yes.","Marianne Lake","We\u2019ve built $25 million of reserve this quarter for auto and we expect to continue. We think that auto opportunity is still strong and we have a great franchise, we have great manufacturing partnerships that are growing strongly too. So, as we grow that portfolio, I would expect us to continue to grow reserves modestly in 2017. However, we are expecting charge-offs to stay under control.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak from Nomura.","Steve Chubak","Marianne, I appreciated your remarks on the latest guidance from Tarullo relating to G-SIB capital. One of the questions we\u2019ve been getting from a lot of folks is because this SEB is calculated based on stress losses year-to-year and historically CCAR results have been pretty volatile, I am wondering how you are thinking about the appropriate management cushion or buffer above the minimum. Historically, it had been about 50 bps just for AOCI volatility and maybe operational risk losses. But, do you now have to also handicap CCAR volatility when thinking about that cushion?","Marianne Lake","So, you\u2019re right and obviously even specifically for JPMorgan, if you look our stress results that [indiscernible] by the fed over the course of last three years has been reasonable volatility. And clearly it\u2019s not the case that we will expect it to be complete. And I would not expect to see the same levels of volatility going forward as we\u2019ve seen historically as the test has as you know over time occasionally included new not insignificant features. And while that may continue to be the case, I would think that there\u2019d be a bit more stability. But, we haven\u2019t actually gone through and finalized our thinking about what the buffers would look like.","Steve Chubak","And one more question just thinking about capital management priorities. Given that the new proposal, as you noted, allows for curtailment of the buyback or termination of the buyback and then curtailment of the dividend halfway through the test, do these changes as well as the softening of the 30% dividend cap alter your thinking about how you prioritize buybacks versus dividends?","Marianne Lake","Before I talk about the prioritization of capital distributions, I would just start by saying our capital management policies prior to this year\u2019s CCAR and these year\u2019s resolutions had us making those actions regardless of whether they were allowed to be reflected in a test. And obviously as part of the resolution planning, we have revised our policies to include more granular triggers. So, our policies do with some specificity run pretty granularly through time through a stress speak to the sorts of actions that we would be leaning into and taking even if they don\u2019t get reflected in the test.","With respect to the prioritization, look, the soft cap on dividend has been lifted. Dividends are ultimately at still a cost of the baseline minimum standard. So, there will be possibly some natural constraint there. It hasn\u2019t changed at this point anyway, the Board\u2019s determination or management\u2019s determination about the order of priority we would like to continue to have the capacity to grow our dividends. And I think even though there may be some natural constraints, I think it would be above 30.","Operator","The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","I just had a question. You pointed out that about three quarters of your credit card acquisitions organic growth coming through mobile channels or digital channels I should say. Can that be moved over to other consumer products or is it just unique to credit cards that you are going to be able to generate that much growth through the digital channel?","Marianne Lake","So, we are very focused across spectrum of our businesses on developing better digital capabilities to allow seamless engagement with customers and acquisition through digital channels. There are complexities associated with documentation and standards for know your customer and anti money laundering that we\u2019re continuing to work through but ultimately it should be achievable and we\u2019re working on it. So, we one of the things that we\u2019ve previously mentioned is that majority of our consumer accounts are opened in branches. One of the reasons among others why branches have been important to us as well as advice centers and we will continue to work on trying to see how far and how fast we can move people to be able to have a better digital experience opening accounts with us.","Gerard Cassidy","And then as a follow-up, obviously third quarter results in investment banking were very strong, fourth quarter seasonally is weaker than third quarter as you pointed out. Are there any other reasons why you think the fourth quarter numbers may be weaker than the third quarter other than the traditional seasonality?","Marianne Lake","I would just -- I\u2019d start by pointing out that about all of the businesses -- all of our businesses, not just the ones that I talked about at the high level, not just macro spread equity, but even if you go a level below that quite granular, all of our businesses did really quite well this quarter. So, not to overuse the phrase, firing on all cylinders but it really was pretty consistent. And normally you might see pockets of more strength or less strength. So, I think it would be hard to imagine replicating this kind of strength through time consistently. But the fourth quarter is seasonally low; we have no reason to expect that it would not be.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, I just wanted to follow up on FRTB and Basel IV and how you\u2019re thinking about the implications for JPM at this stage?","Marianne Lake","So, there isn\u2019t a whole lot of really -- it\u2019s clearly news but as we think about all of the FRTB; we talked about before modest and manageable; nothing about that has changed for us, but obviously there are the advanced and standardized credit operational proposals out there. The most important thing that we yet to really -- and there are pluses and minuses in it and it\u2019s different for us and others maybe but the one thing that we haven\u2019t really heard about yet that is how it will all be calibrated. And calibration will be very important. So, we are expecting to hear over the course of the next short while, and maybe that will be delayed from just given some of the discussions and we\u2019ll update you when we hear a bit more about how it will going to come together. But right now, it\u2019s still little unclear.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time.","Marianne Lake","Many thanks, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.","Marianne Lake","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.","Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion and EPS of $2.29 on revenue of $28.4 billion, all were record for the second quarter, even exceeding the benefit of tax reform.","Our return on tangible common equity was 17%. And also included in the results were two notable items, which I will call out in a momentum, excluding which EPS would have been about $0.10 higher.","The strength this quarter was broad-based across businesses and highlights include average core loan growth excluding CIB of 7% year-on-year, consumer deposit growth of 5% which we believe continues to outpace the industry; card sales up 11%; and client investment assets and merchant processing volumes, each up 12%.","We maintained our number one rank in Global IB fees and CIB delivered double-digit revenue growth across the board. Commercial bank revenue was up 11% year-on-year with IB revenues being a bright spot this quarter. And in asset and wealth management, AUM and client assets were both up 8%.","Turning to page two for more details about the second quarter. The firm delivered strong core positive operating leverage this quarter. Revenue of $28.4 billion was up $1.7 billion or 6 % year-over-year. Net interest income was up $1.1 billion or 9%, reflecting the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower market NII. Net interest revenue was up over $600 million, driven by strong performance in markets and IB fees and also higher auto lease income. NII this quarter was negatively impacted by a rewards liability adjustment in cards. And remember that last year included a significant legal benefit. Excluding these two items, NII would have been up $1.6 billion and total revenue up 10%.","Expense of $16 billion was up 8% year-on-year, with half of the increase directly related to incremental revenues, principally compensation in the CIB, transaction expenses and auto lease growth. About a third related to continued investments in technologies as well as headcount across the businesses and the remainder was largely a loss on the liquidation of a legacy legal entity as part of our simplifications efforts. And if you exclusive this item, expense was up only 7%. The legal entity loss, together with the rewards liability adjustment in cards are the two notable items I mentioned at the beginning for a total reduction of over $500 million pre-tax. Credit costs of $1.2 billion were flat year-on-year and credit trends remained favorable across both consumer and wholesale.","Shifting to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the second quarter with CET1 of 11.9%, up about 10 basis points versus the last quarter as most of the capital generated was returned to shareholders. Risk weighted assets were relatively flat, despite solid growth in loans and commitments, being offset across other categories. In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.6 billion of capital to shareholders and last month the fed informed that they did not object to our 2018 capital plan. We were pleased to announce gross repurchase capacity of nearly $21 billion over the next four quarters and the Board announced its intention to increase our common dividend to $0.80 per share affected in the third quarter.","Moving on to page four on consumer and community banking. CCB generated $3.4 billion of net income and an ROE of 26%. Core loans were up 7% year-on-year driven by home lending up 12%, business banking up 6%, card up 4%, and auto loans and leases also up 4%. Deposits grew 5%. And although growth is slower than a year ago, we are seeing record high retention rates and customer satisfaction scores.","Client investment assets were up 12% with more than half of the growth from net new money flows and we are capturing an outsized share as our customers shift from deposit to investments. Card sales volume was up 11%. And we announced several new cards as we continue to update our product offering. Revenue of $12.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as deposit growth.","Our lending revenue was down 6% on production margin compression and lower net servicing revenue, despite higher purchase volume in retail. And cards merchant services and auto revenue was up 6% driven by lower card acquisition costs, higher card NII on margin expansion as well as loan growth, as well as higher auto lease volumes. This was largely offset by lower net interchange, driven by a rewards liability adjustment of about $330 million, reflecting strong customer engagement across our Ultimate Rewards offering. As a result, the card revenue rate was 10.4% for the quarter, but our full year guidance of approximately 11.25% holds. Expense of $6.9 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher auto lease depreciation and investments in technology.","Finally, on credit. Charge-offs were down $36 million year-on-year, including a recovery of about $130 million from a loan sale in home lending. This was largely offset by higher net charge-offs in card. The card charge-off rate was 3.27%, reflecting seasonality and is in line with expectations and in line with our guidance. There were no reserve actions taken this quarter.","Turning to page five and the corporate and investment bank. CIB reported net income of $3.2 billion on revenue of $9.9 billion, up 11% and an ROE of 17%. In banking, we maintained our number one ranking for the quarter and year-to-date in Global IB fees and with a record first half performance, and we grew share across the regions.","IB revenue of $1.9 billion was up 13% year-on-year, outperforming the market but was down slightly as we saw robust activity, particularly in M&A and ECM. It was a record second quarter for advisory fees, which were up 24%, benefiting from a number of large deals closings this quarter. We gained share and ranked number two globally.","Equity underwriting fees were up 49%. We ranked number one globally as well as in North America and EMEA and gained share in a competitive environment, driven by IPOs and convertibles in the two most active sectors, healthcare and technology, which are areas of strength for us.","Additionally, we saw good momentum in private capital market as clients are exploring alternative sources of capital. And debt underwriting fees were relatively flat versus a very strong prior quarter, supported by healthy acquisition related activity. And we ranked number one in DCMs globally and across all the products. Looking forward, the overall pipeline remains strong.","Moving on to market. Total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 16% adjusting for the impact of tax reform and was driven by strong results in equities, solid performance across categories and with performance picking up in the second half of the quarter.","Fixed income markets revenue was up 12% adjusted on the back of good client flow and decent volatility and with commodities making a notable recovery from a challenging prior year. It was a record second quarter for equities with revenue up 24%, driven by strong client activity and favorable trading results, and with particular strength in cash, prime and flow derivatives.","Treasury services and securities services revenues were each up 12%, driven by higher rates and deposit balances, and security services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity and higher market levels.","Finally, expense of $5.4 billion was up 11%, driven by higher performance-related compensation, volume-related transaction costs and investments in technology. The comp-to-revenue ratios for the quarter were 27%, consistent with prior quarter.","Moving to commercial banking on page six. Another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%. Revenue was a record for second quarter, up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit NII and strong investment banking activity. Gross IB revenue of $739 million was up 39%, driven by several large transactions and strong underlying flow of business and the overall pipeline is robust and active. Expense of $844 million was up 7% as we continue to invest in the business, both in bankers and in technology.","Loan balances were up4% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. C&I loans were up 3% year-on-year and sequentially due to increased M&A related financing with strengths in our expansion markets as well as in specialized industries, and despite lower tax exempt activity. CRE loans were up 4% year-on-year and flat versus last year as there continues to be a lot of completion for high quality assets and we are selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 7 basis points.","Moving on to asset and wealth management on page seven. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $755 million with a pretax margin of 28% and an ROE of 33%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 4% year-over-year driven by higher management fees on growth in long-term products as well as strong banking results. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 6%, driven by continued investment in advisors and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth.","For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $4 billion with positive flows across multi assets, equities and alternatives, partly offset by outflows in fixed income. Additionally, we saw net liquidity inflows of $17 billion. AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were both up 8% with the increase being split about equally between flows and higher market levels globally.","Deposits were down 7% year-on-year, reflecting continued migration into investment where we are also capturing the vast majority and down 3% sequentially on seasonal tax payments. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 12% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending.","Moving to page eight and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $136 million. The result included a pretax $174 million loss on a liquidation of a legacy legal entity, previously mentioned. But it\u2019s of note that while this loss through expense affects retained earnings this quarter, it is offset from a capital perspective. So, it\u2019s capital neutral.","Before I wrap up, you may note, we have no outlook page here. Although both revenue and expense are trending higher market-related, given we\u2019re only halfway through the year, we\u2019re not updating our outlook at this point.","So, to close, the macroeconomic backdrop continues to be supportive. Consumer and business confidence and sentiment remain high, client activity levels are robust, and the markets are open and active. We are pleased with the firm\u2019s results this quarter. Our broad-based financial performance clearly demonstrates the power of the platform. Revenue grew strongly, double digits year-over-year in many cases. We realized positive core operating leverage, despite significant investments and credit trends remain favorable across both consumer and wholesale. This was a clear record for second quarter, whichever way you slice it. We remain focused on consistently delivering for our customers and our communities and investing for the long term.","With that, operator, can you open up the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey. Good morning, Marianne. Can I ask you to talk a little bit about the card business? And you mentioned the strong customer engagement with regards to the rewards markdown. Can you just walk us through what\u2019s the drivers of that and this is a one-time event and does it affect the card revenue rate outlook?","Marianne Lake","So, I\u2019ll start with the end because that\u2019s pretty simple. It obviously affected the card revenue out in the quarter. You can see that that was 10.4%. And you can see on the page, we\u2019ve adopted for the impact. But, the 11.25% for the year remains true, which is to say that while this may be slightly larger than normal, it\u2019s not exactly one-time item. We regularly review our liability as we observe the mix of our portfolio and the behaviors of our customers.","On face value, I know rewards is often talked about as a competitive matter. I mean, this is less about competition per se. In fact, we have record low in sales attrition, which in a competitive environment is really very good. And it\u2019s more about customers awareness of the value proposition of rewards and them being engaged in redeeming them, which for us is a positive thing because engaged customers spend more and we\u2019re seeing that they attrite less, and we\u2019re seeing that. And they will bring us more deposits and investments as we deeper relationships. So, I would say it\u2019s a little larger than normal. We do it pretty regularly. So, it\u2019s not one-time but it\u2019s not completely typical.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And in the press release, Jamie mentioned the first paragraph about increasing competition. Is that a global across all businesses comment or are you seeing it now really in specific areas? Thanks.","Marianne Lake","Okay. I think it\u2019s -- I mean it\u2019s pretty global across all businesses, as a general matter, and there are some obvious areas where it\u2019s pretty acute. And in the retail also space for example, we talked about commercial real estate for example, mortgage clearly with capacity and the systems for example, all of those areas are pretty competitive for a variety of reasons given where we are in the cycle in the economy and like. But I would say broad based, it\u2019s everywhere. That said, we are holding our own and in many cases gaining share. So, we\u2019re doing pretty well.","Operator","Our next question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi, Marianne. I wanted to ask you what you are seeing this quarter in terms of customer deposit trends, a little more color on both the pricing beta and volume balances. Kind of wondering, if you are seeing a lot of competition from the online competitors like Marcus and whether those are affecting your deposit balances with consumers being attracted towards high yields and affecting your pricing decisions?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, I would say -- you talked to consumer deposits, so, I am talking retail now, not the sort of high net worth, but I\u2019ll come back to that. Consumer deposit up 5% year-on-year, slowing down as we would have expected, while you have seen online competitors and even some regional competitors make some moves in the large bank space, we haven\u2019t really seen that yet. When we look at the deposit slowdown and we unpack it, it feels to us like the vast majority of the root cause is customers moving into investments. And in the case of regional customers, that seem to manage accounts. So, it doesn\u2019t even appear to be rate seeking. Spending more would be the second driver and to a much lesser extent are we seeing behaviors like the rate seeking at this point.","So, we\u2019re not seeing that kind of migration out of the Company to online or other competitors at this point. And so, at this point, reprice is still not happening. That said, we are on a journey clearly. And in the higher net worth space, we continue to see the migration into investment assets we\u2019ve been seeing. And again we continue to recapture the vast majority of those. So, at this point, things are playing out as we would have expected and we\u2019re not actually losing deposits en masse to any third parties.","John McDonald","Okay. And just a follow-up on that. Can you remind us what\u2019s the opportunity you see with the rollout of Finn and what advantages you expect to have in that arena?","Marianne Lake","So, I would look at Finn as one of many sort of digital innovations that we\u2019re doing, and I would look at it also in conjunction with broader, digital account opening. And although we\u2019ve now launched Finn nationwide, I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s still very nascent and we\u2019re still learning. So, we\u2019re going to continue to advance -- and it\u2019s got very high net promoter score by the way. So, customer experience is good. But it\u2019s still quite young.","Jamie Dimon","We haven\u2019t really marketed\u2026","Marianne Lake","So, we\u2019re just starting. I would say, digital account opening on the other hand is a pretty good success story. And we are seeing a lot more accounts opened digitally across the channels and we\u2019re seeing of those, a decent chunk of net new to bank. And where we\u2019re seeing existing customers open new accounts, we\u2019re getting incremental money. So, we are seeing our digital asset pay off and even more broadly than that we could go into quick payments and the like. But, I wouldn\u2019t focus overly on Finn as an eye focusing but think digital more broadly.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. ","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Maybe just talk a little bit about loan growth. Obviously, it seems to have picked up in the fed data over the last month or two. What are you guys seeing on the ground? And do you think it\u2019s -- what we\u2019ve seen so far is a good indicator for maybe a more sustained pickup in growth?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I would say that we would use the commercial bank C&I loans as kind of bellwether. There has been decent demand. And I mentioned it in my remarks, the decent demands, not exclusively but partly on the back of a very robust and active M&A environment. And so, the demand is there, I would say, growth is solid, and in line with our expectations we will continue to hope to see that growth as we go through the year. And there may be other tailwinds. We\u2019ve yet to see the full effect of tax reform flow through in profitability and free cash flow. And so, I would characterize loan growth as solid and our expectations for the outlook to remain solid, benefitting from very active capital markets environment.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, when we think about NIM going forward, I mean, I think it was a couple of years ago that you talked about maybe normalized being somewhat the 265 to 275 range or 246 now. Is there a certain loan to deposit ratio you think you need to have, or level of rate? How would you -- just trying to think through how we think about NIM going forward?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I mean we\u2019re at -- fed funds of 125 to 200 right now, but we are not anywhere yet close to normal rates. And so, when we think about what you talk about normalizing NIM, we are thinking about it more through the cycle adjusting for new liquidity rules and everything else. So, we have a number of further rate hikes to go before we reach that point. But, we are on a core basis -- and remember, we have a fairly sizeable market balance sheet, but on a core basis we are continuing to see NIM expansion in line with expectations and moving up towards that. So, we would expect to see expansion year-over-year moving towards that level but not getting there yet.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","My question is on the regulatory process this year under the new leadership. I am wondering if there\u2019s anything that you could share with us that you\u2019ve observed in terms of change. Whether or not it was -- how receptive or not the regulators were during the comment period for the SEB and also during the CCAR process? Was there any marked or observable change in the processes this year versus previous years?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say on the commentary of the SEB, obviously during the comment period, the regulators are quiet. So, it wasn\u2019t a two-way dialogue during that period. We would expect the two-way dialogue to start now that the comment period is over and the industry and bilateral letters have been submitted. I will say, going back to comments I think I\u2019ve made previously that I remain constructive about the willingness for the current leadership to pay attention and take on those comments. And if you look at the proposal that was sent out for comments, not only did it have a large number of questions that they were asking the feedback on but their actual proposal was very similar to what we have been understanding was the intention in speeches that go back a fair way, which is to say that it feels like we\u2019re still making the sausage rather than this is a done deal. And so we\u2019re very optimistic that the comments will be taken on board. And they are -- volatility was evident in spades in this test, opaqueness, GSIB. We can go through them, I am sure we will. So, we remain optimistic that the comments -- bilateral discussions will start now. I would say -- the industry discussions will start now. I would say on CCAR, it felt close to prior years. It not to say that it is not constructive, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s not like basically as prior years.","Erika Najarian","And just my follow-up question is, the pushback that I am getting from a lot of investors on bank stocks is that we are long in the tooth in the economic cycle. Clearly, there is strong activity levels that you posted this quarter and the credit metrics that you posted would suggest otherwise. And I am wondering, both Jamie and Marianne, how you would respond to that pushback that now it\u2019s not the time to invest in banks because we are late in the game from an economic standpoint?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I mean, I would say two things, which is while this cycle is older than potentially typically cycles have been, growth over the last decade has been lower through the recovery. So, there is plenty potentially of room to play. And as we look at all the economic data, not just here in the U.S. but also globally, there are no real signs of fragility. And I know, people are staring at the flat yield curve and we would say that that flat yield curve is a bear flattening, good flattening compared to profitability perspective and not some looming risk of a recession embedded in it. So, I am saying it\u2019s still negative. Real policy rate is still at zero, credit is very benign. That said, we are in cyclical businesses, no doubt. And so, we are preparing and we will be ready when the cycle turns and no doubt there will be impact from that. But through the cycle, I think we\u2019ve proven our business model will produce strong shareholder returns and among best-in-class performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","I wanted to follow up on that last question, if Jamie could respond to. I mean, Marianne, you said the macro is very supportive, you sound very positive. On the other hand, the 10-year treasury yield has flashed some warning signs to a variety of parties. So, Jamie, we have the tax cut, we\u2019ve been waiting for the extra boost to the economy, whether it\u2019s capital expenditures or whatever. Do you think the economy is accelerating, it\u2019s still on steady footing, it\u2019s the same or maybe it\u2019s slowing down? And how should we think about the 10-year? And how do you think about the 10-year, and how do you manage to a flatter yield curve?","Jamie Dimon","Yes. So, just real quickly, Mari said, it\u2019s almost 9 or 10 years of growth at 2%, averaging 20% over the 10 years, it really should have been closer to 40%. There is a lot of evidence that the slack in the system is being finally -- people going back to workforce. The consumer balance sheet is in good space, capital expenditure is going up, household formation is going up, home building is in short supply, the banking system is very, very healthy compared to the past. Consumer confidence and business confidence are very high, albeit off their highs, probably because of some of our trade. So, if you\u2019re looking for potholes out there, there are not a lot of things out there, and growth is accelerating. And of course, things are always a little bit different. My own personal view is that the 10-year is 10-year. I wouldn\u2019t say it has to happen the way it\u2019s happened every time last time. I just think that\u2019s a mistake. The fed is reversing the balance sheet. I think it\u2019s very easy that rates can go up, the 10-year rates can go up in a healthy environment. In history, we\u2019ve had rates going up where you had a healthy environment. It\u2019s not always true that the 10-year going up is bad.","Marianne Lake","Right. I would also say that the shape of the curve is correlated to fed funds in a tightening cycle and that is what we\u2019re seeing. So, while there are other factors weighing potentially on the 10-year in terms of still very accommodative central bank policy, particularly in the banks of Japan and the ECB where obviously trade is not necessarily constructive just in terms of the narrative, short-term underfunded pensions going into bumps, there are some technicals. But fundamentally, what you are seeing in terms of the flattening is pretty typical of a tightening cycle. And as long as it\u2019s accompanied with solid to strong economic growth, it doesn\u2019t concern us at this point. And in fact, as we\u2019ve been pointing out, we are still levered toward fund and rates from a profitability perspective, and we do expect the curve to steepen over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Just one follow-up on the competition conversation. I just want to see, your loan growth decelerated but it was in line with your 7% to 8% goal. Your loan beta capture, what you\u2019re getting on the pricing side is actually a little bit better than what you\u2019ve given up on the deposit sign. So, that all seems fine, but this is the first time I remember putting in the comment about the competition. Are you still okay with the 7% to 8% goal? And maybe just an add-on to that, I\u2019m just curious if part of the competition has anything to do with the private credit market that seems to be growing pretty strongly.","Marianne Lake","I would say just a tiny little correction. Our outlook was 6% to 7% core loan growth excluding the CIB. We\u2019re at 7% now. Things are still moving ahead in line with that. I would also just point out that it is an outlook, not a target. So, while we still feel like that is our outlook at this point, we obviously are going to make the right decisions, based upon the environment that we\u2019re in. Competitively the private credit market for commercial real estate, for leverage, lending, it\u2019s competitive, but so are also the mainstream competitors. It\u2019s just the environment is pretty constructive and everybody is trying to get access to the high-quality assets. So, margins are under pressure. And we will make sure we\u2019re getting the right return for the risk we\u2019re taking.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And then, the follow-up on the expense side. If you did 16 times 4 would be 64. Your outlook is 62, but a lot of those were good expenses on better volumes. Are you still on track in your mind for the overhead ratio goals? I don\u2019t want to overly focus on a dollar amount.","Marianne Lake","It\u2019s a couple of things. So, 62, remember, the 62 was before the impact of expense gross up. So, the actual full-year outlook was about $63 billion, about $63 billion including them. This quarter included one-time item, $174 million on the legal entity liquidation. We knew about that, obviously. So, it was in our number, but you can\u2019t annualize it, you can\u2019t sort of times it by four. So, you\u2019re absolutely right. As we look out for the full year, to the degree that we would be above our -- our outlook is $63 billion, it would be largely driven, if not exclusively driven, by higher performance-related compensation on higher revenues, with the only other caveat that as you probably know, we are waiting as I\u2019m sure you are for when the FDIC surcharge is taken away. The FDIC anticipated that would be in the middle of the year this year, but that is now potentially at some risk, moving out into the third or fourth quarter. So, while that could have an impact on this year, to answer your broader question, are we still on track for our expense overhead ratios? Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","So, just following on the theme of economics and policy, to what extent do you see trade friction, geopolitical concerns, those things starting to impact client sentiment, whether it\u2019s institutional or corporate clients? And ultimately, do you see that -- or how do you gauge that as being a risk to global growth and U.S. growth?","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, I would say, so far, where we are is that trade is firmly part of the risk narrative. So, it\u2019s definitely, as Jamie has said, on the psyche of people. But it\u2019s not at this point causing them to change the strategic actions and decisions that they\u2019re making, but clearly part of the conversation. And as currently outlined, it\u2019s more of that than it is a real impact to sort of the global macroeconomic outlook. But that isn\u2019t to say that uncertainty can\u2019t ultimately lead to more challenges or slower growth but because confidence is a really important part of not just business investment cycle but also the financial market stability. So, at this point, it\u2019s more of a risk narrative than it is an actual driver. But, it is important that that uncertainty is taken off the table.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, and I apologize if you addressed it earlier, a lot of multitasking this morning, but on the market side, you did much better than what Daniel suggested in his update in terms of year-on-year being flattish overall. Can you just give us a sense of what changed in the last month of the quarter?","Marianne Lake","Yes. I\u2019m going to say yes. In a nutshell, it got better. But let me just give you the context. The context is as you\u2019ll recall, as we ended the first quarter, there were some bouts of volatility and clients became more cautious. And that carried over into the first part of this quarter. And so, while activity was fine, it wasn\u2019t as strong. In the second half of the quarter, that generally faded, activity levels picked up. And I would say there were more catalysts. And ironically, one of the more catalysts when you\u2019re thinking about trading volatility or intraday volatility or vol of vol, trade is part of that; emerging market idiosyncratic events are part of that. The European sovereign Italy situation, so, there\u2019s just more catalysts in the market and just generally, more client participation.","Operator","Our next question is\u2026","Marianne Lake","Sorry. Just to finish that to make sure that no one is confused. It was pretty broad based. It was pretty consistent throughout the second half of the quarter. And it wasn\u2019t a lot of one-off large trades.","Operator","And our next question comes is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Jamie, I wanted to ask about the China investment. I know that you put in the press release that you announced this quarter plans for a more significant investment in China. I just wanted to understand the timing. Is this something that\u2019s over the next year or this is a longer-term three to five-year? And if you could give us a sense as to how much is in your control versus needing regulatory approval from folks over there et cetera?","Jamie Dimon","Right. So, I\u2019ll just make a broader business comment for a second. We don\u2019t run -- because I think we easily answered Mike Mayo\u2019s question. We don\u2019t run the business guessing about when there might be a recession because we know there\u2019s going to be one. We already priced through recession. We like to blame clients, bankers, cards, accounts, products, services. That\u2019s how we run the business. Some of the decisions you make are portfolio decisions. You can add to your mortgage portfolio or you can sell it. You can reduce your growth or the loans if you think the credit is bad. And of course, we will do that when the time comes, but we\u2019ll still be adding accounts. And so, to me, I don\u2019t worry as much about the 10-year bond or all these various things. We can manage those risks. We want more clients in almost every business we\u2019re in and want to do a very good job for them in products or services.","China, it\u2019s a long-term story. We\u2019re not looking for any immediate thing. In the next 12 years or so, China will -- internal markets, maybe their bond markets, stock market is probably very close -- equal the size of the United States of America. Therefore, we want to be able to do everything we do here in China. We can do a lot of that in Hong Kong today, but we can\u2019t do it in Shanghai. So, we\u2019ve applied for licenses. And obviously, we need permission ultimately from our regulators and from their regulators. So, it\u2019s totally in their control. And it may or may not be affected by trade, but I look at this as a point in time. It is what it is. Eventually, we\u2019ll get these licenses. Eventually, hopefully, we\u2019ll be a large competitor in Shanghai. Remember, we already do a lot of that business with Chinese companies around the world, with Chinese companies in Hong Kong. I mean, there are a lot of people going into China. So, we\u2019re looking for the full set of licenses to do what we need to do for Chinese companies. Ultimately, I think it\u2019ll be good for China to have a company like JP Morgan equity, debt, credit, transparency, governance issues, inside China.","Betsy Graseck","But right now, today, the ability to operate in Shanghai?","Jamie Dimon","No. Look, we already do deposits, we do certain banking. What we can\u2019t do is equity, debt, and trading of equity and debt. Okay? So, if we get this license one day at 51%, we\u2019ll be able to make -- and with these licenses, we\u2019ll be able to basic equity underwriting, equity sales and trading, research, debt underwriting, debt sales and trading. We could do all of that today in Hong Kong. But remember, Chinese companies, they can do it in Shanghai, or they can do it in Hong Kong, or they can do it in London, or they can do it in New York. We just want the full capability.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Marianne, can you share with us, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I think you guys have given us some color in the past about the impact of the fed taking down their balance sheet over the next three to five years by a couple trillion dollars that it will impact your deposit side of the balance sheet. Can you give us an update of where that stands today?","Marianne Lake","So, the fed has been on a pretty well-telegraphed path here, reducing their balance sheet by about $50 billion a quarter. We talked about the fact that if you take $1.5 trillion out of the system, if you look at -- as the fed has grown its balance sheet, about half of that will ultimately impact deposits. And our share of it would be 10%. So, we talked about potentially that kind of $50 billion to $75 billion of deposit outflows over the several years it would take to reduce that. But primarily they would be -- not exclusively, but primarily not operating and therefore, limited impact on liquidity basis. And so, it\u2019s playing out textbook right now.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then, as a follow-up, I know you\u2019ve touched on this increased competition. Can you give us maybe some more details in the commercial real estate and the residential mortgage area, what you\u2019re actually seeing? Is it just pricing, or is it now loan covenants, is it loan-to-values, any further color there?","Marianne Lake","So, residential mortgage correspondence in particular is pricing; pricing, pricing, pricing. And so, we will see share if pricing goes to what we consider to be not sufficient to return shareholder value. In the commercial real estate space, I would say, it is primarily pricing. So, spreads are under a lot of pressure. And the competition, as I said, it\u2019s GSEs, it\u2019s insurance companies, it\u2019s non-bank commercial institutions. It\u2019s a little bit less credit terms but still pretty robust, albeit that we are seeing a tiny shift to the right in LTVs. We\u2019re not going there, by the way, but I would call it pretty modest. So, I\u2019d say generally terms are holding up quite well.","Jamie Dimon","On the competition issue. I think, it\u2019s good for the country, United States that we have a fully competitive field in card, mortgage, retail, asset management, commercial banking, investment banking, sales and trading. There are strong competitors everywhere. It\u2019s just recognizing that. That\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s called capitalism.","Operator","Our next question is from Al Alevizakos of HSBC.","Al Alevizakos","Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ve got one question and a follow-up. I do care about geographical speed of the IB performance. You mentioned that there were certain catalysts, and you also mentioned, both the Italian situation but also the niche market. So, I want to know whether the strength was driven by the U.S. or whether there were some specific kind of areas that were weaker or stronger. And then, my follow-up is that do you feel it is picking up\u2026 [technical difficulty]","Marianne Lake","I am sorry.","Jamie Dimon","It would be really helpful if you guys weren\u2019t on your cellphones.","Marianne Lake","I am really, really sorry. But actually you were breaking up. And so, I didn\u2019t catch most of that question. ","Jamie Dimon","Where is the IB doing well internationally, USA or Italy?","Marianne Lake","Okay. So, I would say across regions. Equities, strong performance across regions. While there were more catalysts this quarter, but you mentioned Italy, I think. None of those were particular drivers. So, we did fine on all of those, as well as I mentioned. So, I would say broad-based, gaining share we think in some areas in equity, cash and prime in particular, and holding our own elsewhere. And I would say solid performance across the FICC spectrum. And investment, yes, gaining share in investment banking. But obviously, you can\u2019t look at any one quarter.","Al Alevizakos","Thanks for that. And the second part -- and sorry about that. You couldn\u2019t listen before. Do you feel that you\u2019ve started picking market share from the European competitors in the U.S., especially the ones that they are deleveraging?","Marianne Lake","I mean, I would say that if you just go back over the course of the last couple of years, you have seen some share shift from European banks to U.S. banks broadly. In the prime space, I would say U.S. prime incumbents are gaining some share, but it\u2019s not a particularly new trend and it\u2019s not the dominant trend.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","To follow up on the net interest margin, you mentioned ex the markets business it was still increasing. And I was wondering if you could size the magnitude of the NIM increase linked quarter on a core basis, ex markets.","Marianne Lake","Yes. So, linked quarter, reported down 2 basis points because of lower markets NII and higher market assets, $20 billion; core up 8 basis points.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just separately within CIB, the net charge-offs went up. Is that just some of the cleanup in energy? I know, you mentioned that there was a reserve release related to energy, but you had a little blip in the charge-offs there and I just wanted to get some color on that.","Marianne Lake","So, in CIB, the charge-offs were driven by two names and the principal one was the remaining piece of the Steinhoff loan we sold this quarter. We had a reserve release against it that was larger.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Just a follow-up, Marianne. On the capital return that you guys were approved for in terms of the share repurchase. Is that going to be spread out evenly over the next four quarters or will it be more frontend loaded?","Marianne Lake","So, we haven\u2019t disclosed that. But, if you look at our historical pattern, it\u2019s pretty even.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Just a question on CECL. I think, Jamie mentioned in the past that CECL is not a big deal for you guys, and maybe you could explain why and what kind of prep work and what you are thinking about as you work to adopt that over the next couple of years?","Marianne Lake","Sure. I mean, look, CECL is not a big deal insofar as we are getting ready for it. I will tell you that we haven\u2019t disclosed an adjustment number on the basis that we\u2019re still working through the modeling and the data. And it is more complicated, perhaps operationally to get everything lined up than you might think. We\u2019re going to intend to be running some stuff in parallel next year. So, we\u2019ll be able to give you much more color next year. Generally speaking, as we move to life of loan losses, it won\u2019t shock you to know that we will have an adjustment to our reserves through equity. It will be driven most likely by any of the portfolios that have longer weighted average life versus incurred loss models, and card would be the most notable, to a lesser extent unfunded wholesale commitments. But, it\u2019ll be manageable in the context of the firm, it goes through equity. And then, if you think about the economics the cash flows, the NPV of these loans doesn\u2019t change\u2026","Jamie Dimon","So, this is what my comment relates to.","Marianne Lake","Yes. It doesn\u2019t change the economics of the loans. You upfront a little bit of reserves you get paid for over time. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to fundamentally shift the dynamics. But that will play out.","Jamie Dimon","You don\u2019t make economic decisions based upon accounting.","Betsy Graseck","Are there any asset classes where it\u2019s shorter under CECL than under the incurred loss model?","Marianne Lake","It\u2019s hard because it\u2019s life of loan. So, it\u2019s hard to have a shorter -- it\u2019s difficult to imagine that a life of loan could be shorter than an incurred loss. So, no, not really. But for us, the reason why it\u2019s pretty limited -- not to say there\u2019s no other impact, but the reason why it\u2019ll be mostly driven by the areas I mentioned is because in most of our wholesale space and so many of our other products, we are covered for multiple years, if not close to life of loan at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","A quick question, follow-up on card retention. You mentioned that rewards redemption is a sign of engagement. I\u2019m wondering if you could share with us, once redemption hits a certain level in terms of the number of points, so, the number of points remaining may not be enough to redeem a trip or whatever. What is the retention level then?","Marianne Lake","I am not sure that I totally follow the question\u2026","Jamie Dimon","They\u2019re already -- they\u2019re constantly creating rewards points and they\u2019re constantly using those points. And when they use rewards points, some points cost us more than other points. And the pace of the use will change economics a little bit. But basically, it\u2019s still kind of what we expect over time.","Marianne Lake","And remember that in a very, very oversimplified model of the universe, we would run an extraordinarily high level of redemption. We are giving these rewards to customers because we think that they are -- and they indeed are, perceiving great value in them. And so, we\u2019re just continuing to observe that as the mix changes.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Marianne Lake","Thank you very much you guys. Bye, bye.","Jamie Dimon","Thanks for joining. We will talk real soon.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
