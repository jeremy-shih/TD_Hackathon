[Operator Instructions]  And please note, today's call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO.","Douglas E. Fears","Thank you, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO; and John Lindsay, President and COO. As usual and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I'll now turn the call over to Hans Helmerich.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone. We posted solid results for the company's second quarter, considering the sideways nature of the land drilling business since the beginning of 2013. Perhaps, some of the lack of customer urgency is fanning the ongoing macro uncertainty we all read about, including concerns around China, continuing clouds over Europe and, recently, oil prices falling below $90 per barrel. Of course, the last item, oil prices, remains the driver for the energy space and critical to our business, particularly now with nearly 95% of our fleet directed toward oil and liquids-rich drilling. Our assumption is that oil prices show resiliency in the mid-$80-plus range, which we believe would be enough to accommodate gradual growth in activity as we move through 2013.","One pleasant surprise has been a nice recovery in natural gas prices as they approach the mid-$4 range with the aid of a lingering winter. While at some point, improving natural gas prices will show up in an improvement of the gas-directed rig activity, for now, better pricing helps boost our customers' cash flows and improves the economics of projects where associated gas is significant.","So in a steady state market or, more likely, one with slow growth, how would we expect to fare? We have mentioned before some advantages we have in this environment. Customers are deliberate with their budget dollars and become increasingly discriminating with the service providers they engage. Even more so, as they shift into a developmental phase of their drilling projects, where consistency in performance, safety and additional efficiency capture all become imported differentiators. We would expect this to help us again to gain additional market share and appeal for first-time customers with similar aspirations. This environment also helps to moderate industry capacity additions. By our estimate, 80 to 90 AC rigs throughout the U.S. land industry are currently sidelined, and we anticipate new build additions of AC drive rigs to be around 75 or less for this calendar year.","Our own plans remain unchanged, which is to take advantage of the flexibility we have in our manufacturing effort and carefully monitor new build demand as it develops for the rest of 2013. We're pleased today to announce 2 multi-year term contracts for new FlexRigs for work in the U.S. In addition, the company entered into an agreement to build our first new 3,000-horsepower AC drive rig, also under long-term contract, which is scheduled to begin operations in Colombia in the spring of 2014. We believe there is additional potential in the future for large-horsepower AC drive rigs, and we're pleased to secure this project.","Since the beginning of our fiscal year in October, we have completed 20 rigs under term contracts. 8 of those have been completed since the beginning of this calendar year. Our plan for the next few months is to continue a build cadence of 2 rigs per month, in light of our expectation for improving customer demand. This is in keeping with our expectations that the oil field will see a slow improving level of rig activity during the rest of the year.","Also on this call, we wanted to provide some color around the couple of issues we've been asked to comment about in the last several weeks. One is the announced decision of one of our competitors to discount spot rates in an attempt to, in essence, buy up their activity rates. While we questioned the efficacy of this strategy longer-term, we are responding to resulting market tension this has created and estimate that the impact on us will result in around 2 or 3 percentage points of downward pressure on spot rates in average during the third fiscal quarter. The market votes with its dollars, and over time, pricing tends to reflect thoughtful choices regarding performance and overall value proposition. We've shown that performance is differentiated and will be rewarded through premium margins and higher activity levels.","The other issue we've been asked about deals with the difference between 2 standard options of mobilizing a rig on our pad drilling application. The main choice is between skidding the rig on a rail system or a lift-and-roll method known as a walking rig or stopper. Both systems in some form have been around since the 1970s beginning offshore. Some of our competitors have been touting their walking rigs to investors lately, and we're happy to have the discussion, which start by saying that our first experience with skid systems dates back to 1992 with conventional land rigs and, in 2004, with FlexRigs. Learning from that experience and listening to our customers' input and feedback, the skidding remains our system of choice today. Our customers helped us choose the skidding system as a more elegant design and engineering solution on our way to building over 100 pad-capable rigs over the last 8 years.","Whichever mobilization method is utilized, we realized what matters to the customer is the overall well cycle performance that can be consistently achieved. To put it into perspective, the time the rig is moving on the pad represents for us considerably less than 10% of the overall cycle time. The drilling of the well and other associated activities make up more than 90% of the well cycle. So the larger issue will continue to be the overall quest for increased efficiency through the entire well cycle spud-to-spud. The fact that every one of our pad-capable rigs are AC drive helps us to safely and consistently improve performance and deliver value for our customers. We continue to get better at doing just that through a combination of our people and systems and using the best tools available.","I'll now turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported another strong quarter with over $150 million in income from continuing operations. Our balance sheet is in great shape, with a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 6% and total assets now exceeding $6 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $494 million during the first 6 months of the fiscal year, and capital expenditures reached $438 million during the same period. We have increased our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2013 to $850 million. Approximately 60% of this total is related to our new build program, 25% to maintenance CapEx, and the remainder to tubulars and other special projects.","Our depreciation estimate for the year remains at $450 million, and our general and administrative expense estimate for the year remains at $125 million. Our interest expense estimate, which is net of capitalized interest, also remains at approximately $5 million during fiscal 2013.","Our tax rate for continuing operations for the first 6 months of the fiscal year was approximately 35% and is expected to remain at that level during the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year. The holdings in our investment portfolio remain unchanged as compared to the prior quarter and recently had a total pretax market value of approximately $450 million and an after-tax value of approximately $290 million.","I'll now turn the call over to John Lindsay. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter in all 3 of our operating segments, U.S. Land, Offshore and International Land. We believe our strategy of investing in our people, new technology and improved systems is paying off as the demands intensify for faster and faster well cycles in the unconventional plays. Our customers not only expect more from our FlexRigs in terms of performance, but they also expect safe, consistent and reliable operations. And our belief is better technology solutions more effectively deliver on those expectations.","I'll begin the operating results discussion for the second fiscal quarter with our U.S. Land segment, where U.S. Land operating income decreased 3.6% quarter-over-quarter to $226 million, and revenue days increased 104 days to 21,847 days, representing approximately 243 average active rigs in the quarter as compared to 236 rigs active in the prior quarter. We experienced a mix of term and spot market rigs for the quarter that averaged approximately 161 rigs and approximately 82 rigs, respectively. Average rig revenue per day increased by $215 sequentially to $28,255 per day. Early termination revenue in the quarter accounted for approximately $30 per day of the increase. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contracts during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 8% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. This difference is primarily attributable to the mix of FlexRig models and operating regions in these 2 categories.","As expected, our U.S. Land average rig expense per day increased for the second fiscal quarter. The expense per day had a net increase of $451 per day to $13,085, with approximately $174 per day of the increase due to a bad debt reserve recorded as a result of the small customer filing for bankruptcy during the quarter. However, excluding this bad debt reserve, our expense per day would've been in line with our expectations of $12,900 per day.","On the last call, I spent a significant amount of time talking about our cost management efforts, so I won't go into that in great detail on this call, but I would like to recognize the efforts of all of our people that were responsible for the great results in the second quarter. As you've heard us describe, historically, the second fiscal quarter has significant expense per day seasonality as compared to the first fiscal quarter in a range averaging $500 to $1,000 per day. And that seasonality for the second fiscal quarter of 2013 was dramatically improved. A year-over-year comparison shows our expense per day, and 2013 improved by approximately $800 per day as compared to last year's second fiscal quarter. Average margin per day decreased by $236 per day to $15,170 for the second fiscal quarter and was also negatively impacted by the bad debt expense.","Hans mentioned earlier, we announced 2 new build FlexRigs with multiyear term contracts. Those new builds are designed to drill wells on multi-well pad locations. The first new build is a FlexRig3 for the Permian Basin, and the second is a FlexRig5 destined for the Niobrara in Colorado.","Hans also talked about our skid system design and our customers' preference over the walking stopper-type systems. We have a current roster of 27 customers that utilize the 100-plus skid systems that are in service today, and we continue to have new customers that are adopting the use of the skid system. We have confidence the skid system delivers value and is superior to the other systems. I believe those customers know what they want and like what they're getting from H&P in terms of skid times on the pad, move times between pads and drilling performance during the remainder of the well cycle. The customers represented our large and small independents, as well as major oil companies, and continue to contract more of our skid system.","Now let's shift our focus to the third quarter operational outlook for H&P's U.S. Land segment. I want to preface our outlook regarding activity and expected margins with some assumptions regarding commodity prices of the WTI being in a range of $85 and $95 per barrel and natural gas prices being above $3.50. Today, our rig count of 246 rigs continues to lead the industry rig count, an increase from 239 rigs on December 31. H&P also has captured approximately 41% market share of the AC drive rigs working today. In contrast, our 3 largest competitors combined active AC drive fleets capture approximately 39% of AC market share in the U.S. compared to H&P's 41% and make up 51% of their total working fleet as compared to 100% of H&P's.","Another area we have an advantage is in term contract coverage. We currently have 161 FlexRigs under term contract and 85 operating in the spot market. Today, we have 56 idle rigs, including 21 AC drive FlexRigs. Of the 21 stacked AC rigs, approximately half of those rigs were working in the last quarter. Our rig activity has been steadily improving but at a slower rate of increase. For the third fiscal quarter, we expect revenue days to be up approximately 2% to 3% and average revenue per day to be down approximately 1%. We expect third quarter expenses to be in the $12,900-a-day range, with a range of, plus or minus, 1% to 2%.","To date, we've not had -- we've not received any early termination notifications for the third fiscal quarter. Our term contract coverage for our future quarters remain strong. We currently have an average of 158 FlexRigs already under term contracts for the third fiscal quarter of '13, an average of 146 FlexRigs for the fourth quarter of fiscal '13 and an average of 110 rigs for all of fiscal 2014.","Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we now expect average rig revenue per day for our rigs on term contracts to remain relatively flat for the 2 remaining quarters of fiscal '13 and to increase by approximately $150 per day in average during fiscal '14. This is compared to the average rig revenue per day for rigs under term contract during the second fiscal quarter of 2013. Keep in mind that these references are only for rigs that are already under term contracts and exclude any future term contracts.","Now a few comments regarding the Offshore segment results for the second fiscal quarter. Our Offshore operating income decreased by approximately $1.4 million to $13.7 million as compared to the prior quarter. Revenue days increased by 2% to 720 days, as utilization remained constant at 89% for the segment. Average rig margin per day decreased by $944 sequentially to $24,838. The outlook for Offshore as of today, as the segment has 8 rigs active and 1 rig stacked, we expect 8 rigs to remain active throughout the third fiscal quarter. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect Offshore revenue days to be up approximately 1% as we continue to operate with 8 active rigs. We expect Offshore margins to be relatively flat as compared with the previous quarter.","Now a review of the International Land segment, where operating income increased by approximately $4.1 million to $13.2 million. The primary factor driving the improvement was early termination revenue of $5.3 million. Revenue days decreased 10% to 2,023 days, as overall segment utilization declined from 85% to 78%. Average rig margin per day increased $2,653 to $11,053. Of the increase, approximately $2,600 per day is related to early termination revenue. The outlook for international activity has improved since our first fiscal quarter call. Today, the International Land segment has 24 of 29 rigs working, of which 15 are AC drive FlexRigs. The active rigs by country include 6 rigs in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Equador, 3 in Bahrain and 2 in both the U.A.E. and Tunisia. We currently have a total of 5 rigs idle: 3 in Argentina, 1 in Colombia and 1 in Equador. As a result, we expect International Land revenue days to be up approximately 5%. Nonetheless [ph], excluding the effect of early termination revenue, we expect international margins to be down approximately 10% to 15% as compared to the previous quarter, primarily due to labor interruptions within our South American operations and costs associated with rigs transferring between locations to begin operations. The past 3 quarters have all experienced some choppy activity related to rigs being in transition between countries and projects, but we believe this should improve in the fourth quarter.","We are pleased with the announcement of our first 3,000-horsepower AC drive rig. This rig will work in Colombia and is scheduled to be delivered in the spring of 2014, and we'll talk more about that rig in the future.","In closing, we've all read multiple headlines over this past 6 months with questions regarding the impact of rig efficiency on the U.S. Land rig count, the number of wells delivered per rig, and how that will impact the rig count going forward. A lot of variables will drive the rig count. But from our perspective, those drilling contractors that can deliver the best value to their customers in terms of lower cost per foot and additional wells per year will be the contractors that grow and take market share.","We continually monitor our FlexRig performance. And one of the metrics we track include the performance for the complete well cycle from spud to spud. FlexRig performance results from 2010 to year-to-date 2013 reflect the following average rig efficiency trends across all basins we work: footage per day increased in a range of 34% to 44%, while well length increased a little over 20% in an increasingly complex horizontal well environment. In addition to the footage per day improving, FlexRigs have delivered efficiencies that, on average, delivered an additional 10% to 30% more wells per year, depending upon the area. We've commented for at least the past 8 years the FlexRig is a catalyst for better performance, and customers would be willing to pay a premium for the value delivered. The FlexRig design strategy addresses all aspects of the well cycle, and we continue to innovate and improve the process. Finally, we believe our customers are demonstrating their preference with their continued support and collaboration with H&P to contract new build FlexRigs. That has enabled us to grow market share since 2006.","And that completes my operating segment remarks. And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. And now, Tasha, please, we can open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Robin Shoemaker with Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to just clarify what you were saying about the expected drop in spot pricing. So you're indicating that 1% down in the next quarter in terms of margin and then, ultimately, 2% to 3% is the deterioration you expect. So how do you kind of arrive at that number? Do you think we've -- we're bottoming out in terms of pricing pressure?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, let me just clarify, Rob, and this is Hans, that the 2% to 3% was addressing the spot rates. And then as you include the term coverage, which is close to 2\/3, then going into the third quarter, we're looking at a 1% possible diminishment. So it's a little bit less than what you said, but just for clarity.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I see. Okay. So basically, then the 2% to 3% has already happened in terms of the spot rate, and then it's blended with the term rate. So are the idle AC drive rigs you mentioned, the 21, are they -- how -- what are the prospects for them going back to work either on a spot or term market in the current quarter?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, I think we're positive about it. Those rigs are all ready to work. We'd be open to either term or spot workers spread over several basins. And so it gets back to the thought that we're going to see some activity improvement and strengthening in the current quarter and then as we go through 2013, and we'd expect those rigs -- I'd like to think all those rigs go to work by the end of our fiscal year, but we'd expect to see some take up in that idle capacity.","John W. Lindsay","Robin, this is John. I might also add, those 21, I commented that approximately half of those were working in the last quarter, so implied in that, some of the rigs that were stacked last quarter went back to work. So there's this kind of this churn that we've talked about. And again, our hope would be that we continue to put the rigs to work, but we have less rigs that are released. And there are just all kinds of different reasons that they get released. But our hope would be that those rigs would begin to -- or we would have fewer stacked rigs in the coming quarters.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Okay. And you are negotiating, in some cases, term contracts on currently idle rigs, or would you expect them all to go to work on the spot market?","John W. Lindsay","It's been a combination of both. Yes, we've had both.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Wilson with Howard Weil.","David Wilson - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Hans and John, I appreciate the comments on your skidding rigs, but I'm just wondering, do certain areas make it more advantageous for a skidding rig versus walking or vice versa, or is it fairly agnostic? And then as a kind of a follow-on there, are you aware of losing out on a recontracting  [ph]  opportunity or an opportunity, for that matter, solely on the basis that there -- it was a walking rig versus what you guys had to offer?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Go ahead.","John W. Lindsay","Dave, this is John. I think the customer is agnostic. I don't think they care whether we're using a skid system or a lift-and-roll or walking or stomper system. As it relates to the new build environment, I think there's, obviously, been some traction with the walking and stomper systems with older rigs because it accommodates that older structure, and that's advantageous and will be for some -- for I think a fairly short period of time. But kind of like I said in my comments, as well as Hans did, we continue to see rigs contracted, new build rigs, for the last 5 that we've contracted were rigs that were pad drilling systems with skid applications. We continue to have a lot of demand for that. I'm not aware of a particular rig line that we've lost. I don't know the specifics there. But what I do know is that we continue to have customers pick up the systems and add systems to existing rigs.","David Wilson - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then, Hans, just kind of an unrelated follow-on, and not that there's really any indication of change, but do you suspect looking out the way the land rig market is evolving in such a way that there's going to be more rigs in the spot market than -- versus term than there are today? In other words, do we need to get used to seeing more rigs in the spot market, or is it too early to say?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Dave, it may be too early, and a lot of that is what the market serves up. At the same time, we've got a nice profile and split between term and spot rigs. And I don't think there's a built-in bias for that moving down, meaning the term coverage moving down. The numbers we give you in terms of the 158 for the third quarter and then how that plays through, as you know, those are static numbers, so when we signed a term contract, we add that. So I don't have any reason to think that, that mix or profile would change significantly. And we just kind of see where the market takes us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim securities.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question. I don't -- John or Hans, I don't know which of you wants to address it. With...","Hans Christian Helmerich","Depends on how hard it is.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","With the Saudi rig count looking to go up 30-some-odd rigs and large tenders out there, is that a market that you all would consider moving into? And frankly, looking at the tenders, are they of interest to you?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well I'll start, and then John can add. We do have a better presence and footprint in the Middle East than we've ever had, and we've had nice performance from the FlexRigs we have there. Our difficulty in Saudi Arabia has been more contractually driven and trying to work through some of those issues and then just looking at the types of potential returns. Clearly, when they're in a up-ramp mode and adding rigs, and we've heard it expressed that they're very interested in having FlexRigs in country, so I would still like to think that we're going to have an opportunity to be over there. We don't have anything on the plate right now.","John W. Lindsay","Yes, Michael, I don't have much to add other than just to echo what Hans said as far as the performance. And we have 2 FlexRigs in Abu Dhabi, as you probably know, and those rigs are really performing well, great safety performance, great rig move performance. Well cycles are much quicker than what they anticipated, and we're even doing a little bit of science work on the wells also. So I've been very pleased, and I think we've opened a lot of eyes in the Middle East. So yes, we would be hopeful that, that would happen in the future.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Hans, on the issue of cash return, I think you've been, frankly, amongst the clearest in terms of defining the spectrum of opportunities. Here's our cash flow, we'll either go to -- grow for -- or get returned. I'm wondering if in conversations that the board has had over the last couple quarters on this topic, if there's been anything you can say about whether distributions would continue to be annual or whether you would consider to move to a variable dividend structure that's biannual or even quarterly.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Yes. I appreciate the question. And we had our last dividend increase that came from our December meeting. And it's something, Michael, that the board continues to look at, and we've considered different versions of variable dividend that you're talking about. It will -- I think it's a project in progress. I think the board is very supportive and would say that there is additional headroom going forward in a dividend of some kind, and then whether or not we would move the timing of that up prior to our December meeting, I think there's a possibility of that. So all of those things are on the table and then in flux no clear direction that I can provide right now on this call, except to say that we continue to stay that carefully.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Hans or John, just wanted to get your thoughts. I realized the overall U.S. Land rig count has been -- activity has been flattish year-to-date. And in thinking about your 20, 21 idle AC rigs versus the 2 rigs -- new build rigs per month that you're going to continue to build, is there any meaningful distinction between those 20, 21 idle rigs in terms of the characteristics of those rigs versus the 2 rigs per month that you're going to continue to build that, that might suggest that it might be harder to put some of those currently idle AC rigs back to work as we step through the next 2, 3 months?","Hans Christian Helmerich","I don't think that there's a stranded model out there, if you will. I think that it's a situation where we're not dissuaded or feel overwhelmed that, \"Hey, we have some capacity. How does that flow back into our manufacturing plants?\" And Byron, you remember, we've talked about -- as we consider our go forward on our cadence, we've had the nice situation where everything we've built to-date for a long, long time has been under contract. And when we made the announcement in the fall that we were going to go to 2 rigs in '13, starting in '13, we knew that we had a couple rigs in January, I think 1 in February went under contract. And so these most recent new build orders help us keep moving that to the right. So now we have 1 left under contract to deliver, and now here is kind of the junction we're at now, is we can take some of that equipment from the supply chain and unitize it and have it be capital spares, or it also lends itself to being new completed rigs. And so what our plans are today, to go forward for a few months, and we'll have, obviously, more information on the July call, if not before that, and we'll give a better indication of, \"Okay, well, are you converting those to new rigs or are those capital spares?\" but we have that type of flexibility. And based on conversations we're having with customers, I'd like to think that we're going to be able to stay with completing and putting rigs out under contract. But if it came to a point where we ended up with 1\/2 dozen or a dozen-or-so rigs that we ended up building out on our own account, we'd be willing to do that as well. So part of it is a read of how we see demand developing forward and I think being somewhat optimistic about that, and that's driving our thinking and our plans right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Cerasoli with Goldman Sachs.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Waqar Syed from Goldman. Just a couple of questions. Number one, something related to Byron's question as well. But you were the first in this sort of new design AC system rig. And as you look back at your -- some of your earlier rigs, FlexRig3s, and compare them to the FlexRigs that you're building today, the FlexRig3s, is there different equipment on that rig in terms of performance? And as you look at the performance of these rigs, do you see any material difference between the rigs built several years ago versus those being built at -- recently?","John W. Lindsay","Waqar, this is John. The Flex 3s were the first AC driver rig we built, of course, in 2002. We built 32. Those 32 have continued to receive upgrades and learnings that we've had over the years that we then put into what we would call maybe the second-generation Flex 3, if you think about it in those terms. So if you look at performance in the field, there isn't a difference in the performance in the field. We've upgraded operating systems. We've added equipment that we didn't have on originally in 2002, like hydraulic catwalks as an example. We didn't have hydraulic catwalks then. We didn't have casing, running tools back in that timeframe. And like I said, we've had software improvements, and then just the monitoring that we're able to do. So the others -- there's really not any material difference in performance. But we're also, of course, building different rigs today than we did then. We didn't have Flex 5s then. We didn't have Flex 4s. And those rigs have, of course, targeted certain market segments that the Flex 3 wasn't aimed at. So -- but again, those 21 rigs that are stacked, again, another way to think about it, as I've already said, 1\/2 of those worked, but they're also spread across 8 to 10 different basins. So you don't have a large -- it's not like you have a whole lot of rigs just hanging around that are waiting to go to work. There's still demand out there. We're continuing to bid those rigs. We're continuing to have interest from customers for those rigs.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Another question, like if you find a need, what would it take for you to convert a normal FlexRig into like -- into a skid system rig? How much would it cost?","John W. Lindsay","Well, the Flex 3s, we continue to do that. I mean, we continue to have customers asking us to add the pad system to the Flex 3s, and probably an average number is around $1 million to do that.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is there any downtime associated with that change?","John W. Lindsay","Well, there's an installation process during -- that happens on a rig move. A lot of it's done offline, but there's a 1 day or 2 day period of time that you're having to do some welding that you wouldn't want to do during the well.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So bottom line, any rig that you have right now, AC system, could be converted into a pad-type drilling rig with an investment of about $1 million and 1 day of downtime, is that fair?","John W. Lindsay","The rigs that are not pad application rigs right now, which would be Flex 3. Of course, Flex 4Ss and Flex 5s are original design pad rigs. So yes, the Flex 3s can be upgraded. We're continuing to upgrade. I don't have the exact number, Waqar, but we've probably had between 15 and 20 upgraded over the last 6 months or so, I mean, something like that. So yes, it's going to -- it has continued, and I think it will continue.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now secondly, in terms of this whole debate about a walking system versus a skidding system, let's take hypothetically that if customers start to ask for a walking system, do you have a design that you could put on a rig?","John W. Lindsay","We have -- it's interesting. Again, as Hans alluded to, these systems have been in existence since the '70s. And over the years, we've made conscious decisions, and then our -- really, our customers helped us make conscious decisions in '04, and then again in 2005 and 2006, and that's why we have the systems that we have. So yes, if we had a customer that said, \"Hey, we really want walking systems. It's a better application for this particular well configuration,\" then sure, we could do it. It's not rocket science. It's something that we can add to it. But we just really haven't had demand from our customers dip. They've been satisfied with the systems that we've had.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the 3,000-horsepower rig that you're building for Colombia, how much more expensive would it be versus your current rigs that you're building for the U.S. market, the 1,500-horsepower rigs?","John W. Lindsay","I don't know that we're prepared to talk about that right now, Waqar. I mean, it's a much larger rig, so it's going to be more expensive. It also has camp. It also has multiple tubular strings. It's not a -- you don't go out with just 5-inch string of pipe, you've got multiple tubular strings, and as well as BOPs. So it's really not a fair comparison. But what I will say is that our returns, our expectations from that perspective, it's going to be in line with what our expectations have been with FlexRigs.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Lingsch with Simmons & Company.","Josh C. Lingsch - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Very helpful data points as it pertains to rig efficiency, especially as -- with respect to footage per day and wells ordered per year. I'm curious on a leading-edge basis, where we have up today, how much further do you anticipate from those moving maybe throughout -- using just year-end as a benchmark?","John W. Lindsay","Josh, this is John. I want to make sure that I understand your question. So you're asking what additional efficiencies can we capture from this point to the end of the year?","Josh C. Lingsch - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes, yes, exactly. Just the data points you offered earlier, footage per day and...","John W. Lindsay","Well, yes, it's really hard to quantify that. I mean, obviously, when you get to the point of reaching a technical limit of how fast the well can be drilled, then you're performance improvement, that's as good as it gets. But we're referencing are averages, and so I would comment that we -- I think we still have an opportunity to improve the average well cycle times closer and closer to the best in class or the technical limit. But as far as how quickly we get there, I'm not really certain. I mean, the last couple years, we've seen in a ballpark range -- and again, it's area-dependent. I'm giving an average over all of our rigs working in all the basins. Some areas, there's more low-hanging fruit than others. Some areas are -- have gotten a lot closer to technical limit. So I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if there's not another 5% to 10% that we could see this year. But again, there's a lot of factors involved in that. It's kind of a guess at this point.","Josh C. Lingsch - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears a little bit, just a point of clarification on your guidance for International Land. The daily cash margins are expected to be down 10% to 15%. Now it's off of the adjusted cash margin rate when excluding early termination payments, right?","John W. Lindsay","Right. That's correct.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Curran with Wells Fargo.","Thomas Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe a different way of approaching what I sense has been, obviously, one of the hottest topics on this call, and apologies if you've already answered either of these questions. But the first is, of the current AC drive idle rigs, what percentage of those have a skidding system?","John W. Lindsay","We're looking at that -- let's see here. Well, probably, I would answer, probably 25%. I think that's probably a good -- Aaron  [ph]  would you agree? So that's about 25%.","Thomas Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the upfront term new build contracts you just inked for 2 rigs, which model or models are they for?","John W. Lindsay","The first one we talked about's a FlexRig3, and it is going to the Permian, and it has a skid system. And the other is a FlexRig 5, which, by design, is a pad drilling rig, and it's going to Colorado, to the Niobrara.","Thomas Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in the conversations you're currently having, John, regarding the rigs on term that are scheduled to be rolling off contract over the balance of the year, in any of those cases, is the customer, in any way, hinting at potentially wanting to replace a rig that has a skidding system with one that has a walking system?","John W. Lindsay","Tom, not to my knowledge. I've talked -- obviously, this has been a hot topic, and so I have talked to customers. I've talked to several customers. I've had customers in our office over the last couple of weeks, working on various things, and that's one of the questions that I've asked. And I've not had anyone say, \"Oh no, you guys are missing the boat here. You need to be looking at walking systems.\" So I'm not aware of that. It's -- obviously, it's possible, but I'm not aware of it.","Thomas Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then last one for me. Turning internationally, could you just give us an update on Argentina and the latest flow out of that market with regards to potential opportunities either to put one or more of your currently idle rigs back to work or even deploy additional, I would think, AC drive FlexRig models into that market?","John W. Lindsay","Well, we have been successful in putting rigs back to work in Argentina. And we don't have contracts inked, but we feel like the 3 rigs that are stacked, we think it's possible, and those are all larger conventional rigs. We think more than likely a couple of those will go back to work. I don't know whether it will be third quarter or -- more likely it'd be fourth quarter. And -- but I think they will. We have 1 Flex 3 working in Argentina in that unconventional shale play. And I think that there's possibilities for more, but we don't have anything on the horizon right now. The rig's doing a great job. I've been very pleased. Customer has been very pleased. And again, I'm not too surprised, and they're doing a little bit of science-type work, trying to understand more about the reservoir, but I think the rig's performed very well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brad Lundy with Ivory Capital.","Bradley M. Lundy - Ivory Investment Management, L.P.","Had a quick question. On your last call, you spoke about an increased level of focus to return capital to shareholders. Can you, I guess, provide us with a little more detail as to when the board is expected to come to a decision regarding capital deployment positions?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, Brad, I said earlier that the last date we took that up was in December, and we don't have a set time. We'll meet in June and then again in September. We don't have a set time of, hey, we're going to solve for this over this next meeting or the next 2 meetings. I think that the take away, though, is that we're very engaged in the topic, and I think the board is supportive. And so I think that we'll continue to put the time and effort to that issue. And so it's hard for me to tell you today what actual meeting date that will be taken up.","Bradley M. Lundy - Ivory Investment Management, L.P.","Got you. And in the meetings, since the December dividend increase, I guess, trying to understand why the board hasn't taken action to reevaluate the dividend and capital structure. Has that not come up, or it's focused for later in the year?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Oh no, as we've talked, it's come up, and so I don't think it's been a matter of, hey, let's take a pass on this. It's been a matter of -- we took, I think, a nice positive step in December. We have said since then that we recognize there's additional headroom and that we'll continue to move in that direction. So it's really, I think, a matter of timing and moving forward. It's not a matter of, well, we looked at this and decided not to.","Bradley M. Lundy - Ivory Investment Management, L.P.","Perfect. I mean, you guys have certainly done a tremendous job on the operating front over the course of the last several years. But despite that, the stock seems to have been relatively stagnant over the 1.5 years. I would certainly ascribe a material portion of that underperformance to the S&P, to the current capital structure and payout ratio. But we'd love to get your thoughts on what is the appropriate capital structure and payout ratio or what the proposals are to the board at this time.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, no, I know you're keen on that, and I think, for us, it's -- we have said that, certainly, we've got a great balance sheet that could take additional debt on. And we also have the nice occurrence of being able to generate significant free cash flow going forward under our modeling, and we expect to do that, and that will be solved for by returning that to shareholders in terms of the portion we're not using to continue to grow the business. So it's a nice -- I know it's not what the speed you would like, but to us, it's a nice situation of being able to continue to grow the company. At the same time, you're able to positively look at returning additional capital back to your share owners.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Stuart Lippe with RBC Global Asset Management.","Stuart Adam Lippe - RBC Global Asset Management (U.S.) Inc.","You mentioned that you said 95% of the drilling --  of your activity right now is oil drilling. Does that mean -- there must be a lot of gas being found with some of that. But I guess the question I have is, do you remember what price gas was at when you really had -- when gas, let's say, was half the drilling activity? And is it --is there a certain threshold do you think that would start stimulating a lot more gas drilling independent of the oil drilling? And that -- would that be in different fields that are currently being drilled right now?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Yes, it's a great question because I think part of the positive go forward is when customers are at a price threshold where they're willing to go back and add to their dry gas-directed rig count because, like you said, that combination of oil and liquids-rich drilling takes up 95% of what we're focused on. So that would be an incremental add to have additional dry gas-directed drilling. And so we've lived through some difficult times recently and seen gas, I think at one point, it dipped underneath the $2 threshold. So everyone was just -- a lot of gnashing of teeth. But now that we're above $4, people are starting to talk about exactly what you're asking about. We don't think it's necessarily a 2013 event, but what we would hope is that we continue to see some take-up on the demand side. And you've got this very low gas-directed count, so that's going to, I think, set up for some potential opportunities in '14 to put rigs back to work that are looking for dry gas.","Stuart Adam Lippe - RBC Global Asset Management (U.S.) Inc.","Why not '13? Is that -- I mean, why wouldn't, let's say, $4.50 or $5 gas get things going this year?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Yes, well, I think there's certainly some basins and projects where the economics work at the prices we have today. Oftentimes, there's a little bit of a lag effect between you hit a certain price point and it takes some time. And I guess part of it is a sanity check of, hey, we're going to stay here for a while, or is it going to continue to move up; and then part of it is take the Haynesville. You've moved some rigs out of the Haynesville. What does it take to motivate you to go back. But that's just one example, there are other examples where it wouldn't take that much effort. But kind of the history of it has been that the industry typically goes through kind of this pause as they verify that this is a price deck that's going to stay in place for some time, and then they start going to work.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue.","Juan Pablo Tardio","All right.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO of Helmerich & Payne. You may begin.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast corresponding to the fourth quarter and fiscal year end of 2012. With us today are Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO; and John Lindsay, President and COO.","As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to Hans Helmerich. Hans?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thank you, Juan Pablo. We are pleased to report record revenues and all-time high net income for our 2012 fiscal year. During a year that experienced substantial headwinds across the oilfield service sector in terms of volatile energy prices and a sharply declining gas-directed rig count, it's a nice tribute to our people and their dedication that allowed us to post several all-time high marks. For example, 2012 was also our best safety year ever as the company continues to achieve the lowest recordable injury rate by a wide margin as compared to the industry and our largest competitors. Additional manufacturing and operating performance achievements set new standards during 2012 and acted to further underscore the company's organizational competencies and competitive advantages.","Speaking of organizational competency, it's easy to focus on FlexRigs and the number side of the equation and overlook the primary role that our folks play in our continuing success. But in fact, this is very much a people business, and we are convinced that a strong culture is our most sustainable strategic advantage. We think of culture as the business of encouraging genuine buy-in, company-wide, of our shared values, touchstones such as integrity, safety, innovation, teamwork, then providing the framework and the systems with the tools to see those values translated into improved field performance and long-term value creation.","Our ability to recruit and retain the best people is a top priority to building on our success going forward. The proof shows up in lots of ways. Here's one interesting snapshot. At a recent company service award dinner, we recognized the loyalty of some of our long-service employees.","Listen to the totals regarding our on-the-ground experience. In 2012, we have 911 employees with 10 or more years with H&P; we have 198 with 20 years or more; and then 69 with 30 years or more. Those may be the numbers we're most proud of today.","Before I turn the call back over to Juan Pablo and then to John Lindsay, who, you will recall, was deservedly promoted to President at our last board meeting, let me first make some comments about the broader energy landscape as we head into 2013. The volatility in the energy prices during 2012 saw natural gas prices trade below $2 an Mcf before improving significantly. However, NGL prices sank and oil prices dropped to $77 before recovering back to a range of $85 to $100, with current pricing on the low end of that range. Our sense is that oil prices within that range will result in improved activity levels as customers begin to allocate their 2013 budget dollars.","It's hard for us to see natural gas price -- prices increasing enough to add much incremental drilling activity early in 2013. In addition to a cold winter, we'd have to see stubbornly high production levels ease off and actually decline and then gain a better understanding of the true scale that associated gas provides the market. Finally, it's difficult to pinpoint the scope of the well backlog overhang. We expect customers to be patient during the first half of 2013 to allow these issues to play out more fully and to see their impact on natural gas pricing.","In addition to the energy pricing environment, improved drilling efficiencies are receiving more attention as a growing factor in sorting out the future rig activity levels. Of course, drilling efficiency is a theme we've been focused on for over 10 years, and it comes as no surprise that more and more operators see the potential of executing their drilling programs faster and with fewer rigs. As we expected, the bar is being raised for what constitutes a suitable rig and that squeeze will continue.","We have not only aggressively repositioned our fleet to nearly 100% AC rig offering, but we've also delivered significantly better performance from those rigs. For instance, our footage per day has increased by over 50% from 2007 to 2012, while at the same time average well depth has increased by over 40%. As a result of the enhanced average cost per foot, we continue to drive a compelling value proposition for our customers. And while the rest of the industry has added AC drive rigs to their U.S. land fleets, our top 3 competitors, combined, have officially retired more rigs than they have built since January of 2009.","Another way to look at it is, since the industry's rig count peaked in 2008, our active U.S. land count has increased by 25% ,whereas the same 3 competitors have seen an average reduction of 25%.","Our expectation is that the drilling efficiency continues to be a driver for operators going forward, and that they will continue to provide attractive opportunities to service companies that deliver top performance. For H&P, we would expect the coming year to offer new build opportunities and the prospect to continue to lead the land industry in margins and activity levels.","Now I'm going to turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $574 million of income from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, representing an increase of over 30% as compared to the prior year. We also reported all-time high levels of $581 million of net income and $3.15 billion of revenue for the fiscal year.","Our capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion during fiscal 2012, and our corresponding estimate for fiscal 2013 is, at this point, $740 million. Approximately 50% of this CapEx estimate is related to our new build programs, about 30% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to tubulars and special projects. The portion allocated to our new build program includes the completion of new FlexRigs that are already under long-term contracts, as well as capital components and spares to either service existing rigs or be used to complete and deploy additional rigs.","Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1 billion during fiscal 2012, including approximately $200 million in deferred income taxes. We benefited from these deferred income taxes largely as a result of the deduction for accelerated bonus depreciation used in determining our cash tax obligations. Assuming that the accelerated bonus depreciation is not extended, we estimate that our net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2013 will benefit from approximately $40 million in deferred income taxes. We expect at this point to be able to fully fund our fiscal 2013 CapEx program, as well as other scheduled commitments from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities during the fiscal year.","With a very strong debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 6%, the company's debt level declined to $235 million at the end of the fiscal year, including $40 million scheduled for payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.","As reported in our consolidated financial statements, depreciation expense for fiscal 2012 was approximately $388 million. This amount included approximately $16 million of abandonment charges, most of which impacted our fourth fiscal quarter as described in our press release. Given the continuing growth of our fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $450 million during fiscal 2013.","As the company continues to grow, general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase to approximately $115 million during fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, interest expense, after capitalized interest, is expected to decrease to approximately $7 million during the fiscal year.","Our investment portfolio, comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger, recently had a pretax market value of approximately $440 million and an after-tax value of approximately $280 million.","Our effective tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2012 was reported at approximately 36.5%, and at this point, we expect a similar rate for fiscal 2013.","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions. John?","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U. S. land, offshore and international land, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2013.","I'll begin with our U.S. land segment, where revenue days decreased marginally to 21,951 days, representing 239 average active rigs in the fourth quarter. Included in the active rigs is the delivery of 12 new build FlexRigs during the quarter. Even though these new rigs were offset by previously active rigs becoming idle, AC drive FlexRigs maintained utilization levels above 95% for the quarter.","Of the 239 active rigs, an average of 157 rigs were working under term contracts and an average of 82 rigs were working in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $229 sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $28,325 per day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $280 per day in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared to approximately $140 per day in the third fiscal quarter.","Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately 7% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. This difference is mostly attributable to the mix of rig types and regions in these 2 categories. Average rig expense per day decreased $717 per day to $12,620. Average rig margin per day increased by $946 per day to $15,705 per day.","The outlook for the U.S. land segment continues to remain positive. Our new build FlexRig program continues to lead the industry with on-time and under budget delivery. We have been delivering at a cadence of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month since October of 2011. Since October 1, 2012, the beginning of fiscal 2013, 7 FlexRigs have been completed.","Nine contracted FlexRigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through calendar year end, and we plan to deliver 2 contracted FlexRigs per month in January and February of '13.","As of today, our U.S. land segment active rig count is 237 rigs, which leads the U.S. land in active rigs. 234 out of the 237 rigs are AC drive rigs. The 237 active rigs include 159 under term contracts and 78 operating in the spot market. Of the 78 rigs in the spot market, 77 are FlexRigs.","Our rig count bottomed toward the end of September at 230 active rigs, and we believe our U.S. land rig activity is positioned to improve for the remainder of the calendar year and into the first calendar quarter of 2013. The qualifiers for this assumption are that oil prices remain strong, provided WTI remains above $80 a barrel and natural gas prices remain in the $3.50 range.","We also have 52 stacked rigs today, excluding the 6 conventional rigs that were decommissioned at the end of the fiscal year. Of the stacked rigs, 20 are AC drive FlexRigs. However, at least 6 of those of FlexRigs have commitments to begin operations before the end of December.","In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect average revenue days to be down approximately 2% as compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the first quarter to be roughly flat as spot day rates have only slightly declined during the last few months and should remain firm through the remainder of the quarter. Revenues from early terminations are expected to be under $1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2013.","Our term contract coverage remains strong. We already have an average of 158 rigs locked under term contracts for the first fiscal quarter of '13; 150 rigs for the second quarter of fiscal '13; and 141 and 97 rigs for all of fiscal '13 and for all of fiscal '14, respectively.","Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we expect revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contracts to increase by approximately $100 per day, on average, in the first fiscal quarter of 2013 and by approximately $250 per day, on average, for fiscal '13. Both of these increases are as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012.","Our guys continue to work very hard to provide exceptional service to our customers, and at the same time, control costs. We were very pleased with the expense-per-day results during the last 2 quarters and expect average rig expense per day for the first fiscal quarter of 2013 to be in the $13,200 per day range. As a reminder, during the 2012 fiscal year, expense per day has ranged from $12,292 to $13,826 per day.","We believe the continued expense per day improvements over the past 2 quarters are a result of our improved systems, supply chain processes and procurement, to name a few. We are convinced that we will continue to improve our processes. Nonetheless, our average rig expense per day will probably continue to experience quarter-to-quarter volatility as the timing of expenses can be influenced by many different factors.","And now, I'll review our offshore segment fourth fiscal quarter results, where offshore operating income increased by approximately $4.3 million to $12 million as compared to the prior quarter. Revenue days increased by 15% to 695 days as 2 rigs returned to work. Average rig margin per day increased by $6,429 sequentially to $23,330 per day. The increase was mostly attributable to rigs completing mobilization and commencing drilling operations.","Earnings from management contracts declined by approximately $1 million to $1.2 million, primarily as a result of 2 rigs moving to cold-stacked rates.","Our outlook for offshore. As of today, the company's offshore segment has 8 rigs active and 1 rig stacked. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margin per day to be roughly flat during the first quarter of fiscal '13. We expect pretax earnings for management contracts to be flat at slightly over $1 million during the first fiscal quarter.","Now a review of our international, where international land segment operating income results from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter increased by approximately $1 million. The primary factors driving the increase were increased activity and margins. Revenue days increased 8% to 2,001 days as 4 contracted rigs commenced drilling operations during the fourth fiscal quarter. Average rig margin per day increased $506 to $8,210 per day, which was mostly attributable to reduced mobilization and start-up costs as compared to the third fiscal quarter.","The outlook for international. As of today, the company's international land segment has 26 rigs working, of which 16 are AC drive FlexRigs. Seven rigs are active in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 both in UAE and Tunisia. All 3 idle rigs are 3,000-horsepower conventional rigs located in Argentina. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect international land revenue days to increase approximately 15% and average daily margin to be down approximately 10%, primarily due to downtime and labor interruptions in Argentina.","Now that completes the operating segment remarks, and I will conclude with a few examples why we believe current market conditions present an opportunity for H&P to gain market share.","First, we've picked up 10 new FlexRig customers during the past 12 months. You may recall, after the '08 downturn when activity began to improve, we were able to attract more than 20 new FlexRig customers. These new customers have shown a desire to high-grade their rig fleets because of efficiency gains for AC drive FlexRigs.","Second, there's evidence the replacement cycle is continuing. During the past 12 months, the overall U.S. land rig count has decreased by approximately 230 rigs and yet the AC drive rig count has increased by approximately 70 rigs, indicating AC market share has increased, and overall U.S. AC utilization remains above 85%. Combined, the SCR and mechanical rig counts decreased in total by 300 rigs, causing market share reductions, and the combined SCR\/mechanical utilization today is below 60%. With approximately 15% of the AC rigs stacked in the U.S. today, rig count bifurcation is occurring, and we believe those AC rigs are better candidates to return to work before the recently stacked SCR and mechanical rigs will return to work.","Finally, and looking ahead to 2013, H&P's efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering best-in-class safety and operational performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create competitive advantages for the company, and we believe this should continue to provide future opportunities to build new AC drive FlexRigs.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. And, Victor, we will now open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll first go to the side of Joe Hill with Tudor, Pickering.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That was a fantastic quarter. John, could you talk to us about some of the different pieces of the expense movement in U.S. land that you guys saw in the fourth quarter, and maybe talk about what was actually going on at the field level relative to what was lower R&M expense and lower mob and stuff like that?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Joe, there's -- as we've talked about on this call and really previously, there's so many moving parts and pieces. There was M&S improvement during the quarter. There were other multiple moving parts that you could classify some as maybe not necessarily recurring in the next quarter. And so again, it's really hard to quantify it and give a lot of detail on it. M&S was a partial driver. I really think, though -- again, you've followed us a long time, if you just think about that band of expenses that we've seen over the last -- really, the last couple of years, we're in that -- we're kind of in that bandwidth. This quarter, we're on the lower end of that. I think our improved processes and systems, the effort by our folks, I really think it's going to enable us to tighten that band, if you will, that range of expenses and that's what I was trying to address in my comments.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So when I think about the $12,620 you guys experienced in the fourth quarter, can you bridge me to the changes, to the $13,200 you expect in Q1?","John W. Lindsay","There's going to be -- again, a large portion of that is M&S. I mean, the M&S for the quarter was excellent. I mean, we did a great job. I think another thing to consider is during this quarter, we're going to be reactivating rigs. That's a variable that's in play here as well. So again, it's really -- it's M&S and just other onetime opportunity that we just don't think that we'll see in this quarter.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, John, you've talked about seeing some improvements if we're experiencing stable commodity price trends in terms of the number of rigs you guys have working. But you've got your days down 2%. Is there anything going on there that we need to be thinking about?","John W. Lindsay","No. I think it's -- there's a lot of moving parts and pieces to the rig count. If you think about October, we started October at 230, and so the October average is below where we're guiding toward. We're at 237 today. We think we're going to continue to contract rigs, but we also have some rigs that are going to roll off of term contracts. In some cases, we're forecasting those to work. In other cases, we're not forecasting them to. So again, that number is in average compared to the fourth quarter. It's really nothing going on. It's just -- that's just kind of the way it appears as you look at the various segments and areas that we're working and just run the numbers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I think what I was able to pick up in the early part of your prepared commentary, Hans, was an expectation that there will be an increase in activity. But I also got the distinct impression that I think, as an industry, we're still trying to grapple with the magnitude of what that improvement will be. So in some of your maybe recent discussions with varying customers, what were kind of -- what kind of indications have they been providing to you? And is it something that may take them much longer into the first quarter to kind of get back to work or -- I'm looking for some color here and trying to get a sense on what kind of magnitude of directional change in activity we might see in the first part of next year.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Yes, Kurt. I think there are 2 pieces. One, of course, we don't have any control over and you guys watch closely, which is just directionally, where energy prices go. One of the things I wanted to point out is that there's some sense out there, and I hope they're right, that natural gas provides some lift. We don't see that happening very soon. If the oil prices are in the band that we've talked about, between $85 and $100, we think that's a positive environment. But the second piece is that, just anecdotally, we've had conversations with customers that indicate they will push the restart button on some budget dollars and as they even approach the turn of the calendar, prior to that, they're trying to sort through what type of rig rosters and what upgrades and additional rigs they may be interested in as they go forward into executing their 2013 drilling plans. So from several of those conversations, we've been encouraged that we'll see some lift there. And then we'll start the year and see what happens. But yes, I think we're encouraged from what we're hearing.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then from the international front, I wasn't quite sure if I kind of picked up on what you were saying correctly going into, I think, the next quarter. You said you expect an increase in revenue days by 15%, but margin down 10% because of downtime in Argentina. Did I understand those 2 dynamics correctly?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, Kurt, this is John. That's correct. It was -- there was some rig downtime and some labor union issues in Argentina and that's what will impact the quarter negatively.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But your activity levels are going up, but you're making less on the activity that you're doing and it's all because of what's going on in Argentina.","John W. Lindsay","Correct.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Brad Handler with Jefferies.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Maybe I could come back to Joe's questioning on the expense side, just a little bit. You talked about narrowing that band. Is that -- is the band -- from what we saw in the first half of the year, is that the narrowed band? Or are you putting yourself in a position where you'll be able to come back to us with a narrower band at some point in the near future?","John W. Lindsay","Well, if you look at the range of $12,000 to $12,300 up to $13,800 and some change, the $13,800, I think, was a little bit of anomaly. But if you look at the last 2 quarters, obviously, we've improved. But again, I can't stress enough the -- I don't think I mentioned, when Joe asked, the seasonality piece. There is definitely seasonality and then there's market conditions. There's just rigs reactivating. There's things that happen. But yes, I believe that we're going to be able to narrow the band. So rather than it being in the, what, the $1,600 range, we narrowed that range -- that band width down. And last quarter, we were at $13,300. And so again, I think $13,200 is a reasonable number to guide going forward.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. On -- as it relates to some individual pieces, you've stressed the supply chain improvements and the like and that sounds great. I'm curious, can you comment on labor or rather wage conditions as we head into calendar '13? Is there some explicit increase in wages that averages out that we should think about it as it relates to your U.S. expenses?","John W. Lindsay","I don't think so, Brad. We had a wage increase. It'll be a year ago towards the end of -- well, it'll be a year at the end of December. And again, we addressed this. The rig count's down over 200 rigs and so it's been a great opportunity for us to high-grade folks. We've continued to grow our fleet. And so I think we're in really good shape in terms of labor -- labor costs. I don't see any labor increases that are on the horizon at this stage.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Maybe an unrelated follow-up for me, just one more. On the CapEx indications that you've given, the $730 million, if I wrote it down right, you contemplate some new builds. I guess, how many new builds are contemplated in that? And to some degree, what I'm getting at is I guess there's a flow of new builds being contemplated outside of what's already been contracted, if you can clarify that for us.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Yes, Brad, this is Hans, I'll take a shot at that. And I think the questions are good relating to the expense numbers, and it's hard to give lots of specificity and details, but I think and I hope one of the takeaways is we've focused on this for the last year. As an organization, we're getting better at it. We'll continue to put energy and effort into it, and I think the systems and the folks we have are doing a great job in managing that. So we're encouraged by that even though as we talked about a range in some of the moving parts particularly, I think, and John mentioned, the reactivation, as we get guys trained up and get those rigs out and top notch, that will drive some uncertain expenses. But now to move to your question related to the CapEx and how it might impact our manufacturing plans and efforts, I think just to remind folks, we've got 9 rigs left to deliver. 5 of those come out in '12, 4 in '13. John mentioned we'll have 2 contracted rigs roll off in January and 2 in February. So as we contemplate our CapEx for the year and ask what happens from March on, our model and our preference is to have fully contracted rigs. I think in a market like this where we've had a lull for a period of months, we've seen this happen before, and oftentimes as visibility improves and operators respond to a better outlook, we can see a pop back, if you will, after a lull like that. So we want our supply chain to be ready to respond to that. And I think we're in good shape in that respect. We've talked before about the need for capital spares and unitizing some parts and pieces that will support a rig fleet of our size. As we have a active and robust manufacturing effort, we're able to drive those to kind of a near 0 status because we can pull that out of the manufacturing queue. If we see things slow down, and they'll certainly slow down in '13, then we will spend some time and effort and dollars having capital spares at the ready. Those can transition into equipment kits and potential new builds. So I think, maybe lastly, we've had conversations with folks about, if we get into March -- we're in a good position of not having to make a decision now. But one of the nice things about the flexibility of our manufacturing effort is as we look to March and forward, would we be willing to capture the continuity value of a dialed back manufacturing effort? And we would certainly consider that. And so, if that meant 1 or 2 rigs per month for a very short period of time, then we would give that consideration. But we're not at the point where we have to decide that. So that's kind of, I hope, some color on your question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Novid Rassouli with Dahlman Rose.","Novid Rassouli - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Hans, I was just curious, on the rigs that are rolling off on the 3-year term contracts, are you guys able to continue securing the 12- to 18-month shorter contracts we discussed before? Or are the majority of these rigs moving to the spot market? If you could just give us just a little bit of color there on the environment.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, I'll respond and then have John add to that. It really becomes dependent on customers and where those rigs are located. There have been several instances where somewhere during the term, a customer moved a rig, for instance, out to the Permian. And then if that rig would roll off, they'd be more inclined to want some term extension, like you mentioned, of 12 or 18 months, that gives them some visibility on keeping that rig there. There are other situations where we've had customers say they're willing to see that going to the spot market and either they'll retain the rig or it rotates to another customer. So it really seems to be particular to the customer and their wishes. There's not a lot of -- as you would expect, there's not a lot of push for a rig rolling off and then folks at this point signing up for extended term. But I think that's just a reflection of the market we're in.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it appears we have no further questions at this time.

The speakers today will be John Lindsay, President and CEO; and me, Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO.","As usual and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. 2014 continues to be a strong year for the land drilling industry as the shale revolution marches on. This upbeat earnings season has been notable for new build announcements from all the major drilling contractors. For a decade, we believe H&P has been the undisputed leader in the new build replacement cycle, and with today's announcement of 13 new FlexRigs, we have a total of 30 signed new builds since last quarter's earnings release. In fact for our 2014 fiscal year-to-date, our 74 FlexRig announcements set a new all-time company record in a 12-month period.","It's an interesting contrast to look at today's very strong market versus the market we were faced with a year ago. Even though oil prices at this time last year were near $100 a barrel, like they are today, we didn't announce any new build contracts while some of our competitors did. In fact, the market would only bear very low day rates and short-term contracts on new builds at that time, providing very low rates of return. We decided to be patient rather than sign contracts for new builds at low rates. Our belief was that the market would improve, allowing those rigs to be contracted at attractive rates of return at a later time. We were fortunate the market did begin to improve in the fall of 2013.","Today we are again leading the way in what is shaping up as round 3 of the new build replacement cycle. We have been successful in supplying AC drive FlexRigs in response to our customers' demand for high efficiency rigs to drill horizontal wells with increasing complexity in the unconventional resource plays. Since 2006, customer demand has allowed H&P to increase our new build cadence for the third time to 4 FlexRigs per month.","While more competition exists for AC drive market share, we believe H&P continues to be best positioned to benefit from the new build awards with the best customers, as we have in the past, because our focus remains on execution. H&P's ability to design and cost-effectively build the FlexRig on a reliable cadence, crew the rig with quality personnel and deliver the best drilling and safety performance on the largest scale in the industry are all very strong competitive advantages.","Three notable milestones were accomplished by the company during the third fiscal quarter. We achieved record revenue, operating income and rig activity after activating 11 new FlexRigs during the quarter. Our U.S. land rig count today leads the industry with 292 active rigs, up 49 rigs since our third quarter call this time last year. Of the 74 new builds announced this fiscal year, we have already delivered 36 FlexRigs to date.","Our new build construction effort delivered 2 rigs per month for the first half of the fiscal year, and during April we increased our cadence to 3 FlexRigs per month, and we'll continue until September when we transition to 4 rigs per month.","No industry peer has sustained a 3 rig per month cadence, much less 4 rigs in the U.S. land market, although it appears that some of our competitors have now targeted these high levels of rig production. And with these new higher levels of new build plans from our peers, there are more questions today by investors related to the number of AC rigs needed in the industry. While we won't try to predict the AC drive rig count required to reach a saturation point, the fact is there are still over 1,000 legacy mechanical and SCR rigs running in the U.S. today and an even larger amount of very old rigs running internationally. Furthermore, of the 1,000 legacy rigs running in the U.S., approximately 75% are drilling horizontal wells.","Since 2006, AC drive rigs have replaced hundreds of mechanical and SCR rigs. So we believe there are still many years of the replacement cycle ahead prior to approaching AC rig saturation in the industry.","A review of the macro environment shows oil and gas prices remain stronger than originally expected for 2014. This has resulted in providing many of our customers with the confidence to expand their drilling budgets. The U.S. land industry activity is up approximately 130 rigs in 2014, according to the Baker Hughes rig count, and H&P has been able to grow along with the expansion and capture incremental market share gains. The increase in activity has primarily been associated with horizontal wells with longer laterals that FlexRigs are designed to efficiently drill. As a result, we expect our activity and market share to continue to improve.","We are encouraged by customer discussions for additional new builds in 2015. Assuming market conditions remain favorable, our plan would be to continue the 4 rigs per month cadence through at least the first 9 months of the 2015 fiscal year. With 38 contracted new build FlexRigs still left to deliver and encouraging conversations with customers for additional new builds, we believe fiscal 2015 is setting up to be very strong. These market conditions should allow us to improve our pricing in the spot market, as well as for term contracts for existing rigs and new builds.","We were also pleased to announce earlier in the third quarter that our board approved a dividend increase of 10% to $2.75 per share on an annualized basis. You've heard us talk in the past about an all-of-the-above strategy, meaning our strong financial position and strategic position provide a combination of organic growth opportunities and at the same time allows us to return cash to shareholders.","Let me conclude my remarks by noting H&P's long-term strategy for growing shareholder value. We will continue to drive innovation at the rig site and in the systems that support our FlexRig value proposition. We will continue to invest in technology to drive safety improvements for our people and operational excellence for lowering our customers' drilling cost. And we will continue to invest capital that results in attractive returns for our shareholders. H&P's continued success is a result of our people and new technology solutions that drive lower well cost for our customers, and I would like to thank all of our employees for their contribution to the effort. And now I will turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. The company reported $952 million in revenue during the third fiscal quarter of 2014, along with $272 million in operating income, which represents an increase of over 6% as compared to the prior quarter.","In reviewing some of the drivers that led to these all-time record levels, I will comment on each of our drilling segments and will then expand on other considerations.","Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered stronger than expected results at $271 million in segment operating income. The number of revenue days increased by about 7.3% from the prior quarter, resulting in an average of over 286 active rigs during the third fiscal quarter.","In average, approximately 165 of these rigs were active under term contracts and approximately 121 rigs were active in the spot market.","The average rig revenue per day slightly increased to $28,126 and the average rig expense per day slightly declined to $13,035, resulting in an average rig margin per day improvement of $134 to $15,091.","As of today, the 333 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include 292 contracted rigs, 35 idle rigs and 6 inactive rigs that are currently held for transition to the YPF Argentina project. Of the 35 idle rigs, only 3 are AC drive FlexRigs, and the remaining 32 idle rigs are SCR rigs.","The 292 contracted rigs are comprised of 291 AC drive FlexRigs and 1 3,000-horsepower SCR rig. Included in the 292 contracted rigs are 178 rigs under term contracts and 114 rigs in the spot market.","Spot pricing has continued to slightly increase, and it is still about 4% lower as compared to pricing for rigs currently under term contracts, most of which were originally priced in even stronger markets during the last few quarters.","Looking at the fourth fiscal quarter. We expect revenue days to increase by about 2% to 3% quarter-to-quarter. We also expect improvement in our average rig revenue per day level, primarily as a result of continuing increases in spot pricing in the market, which offset the negative impact of rigs that, in average, are rolling off from long-term contracts into today's lower pricing environment.","Our best estimate at this point for the fourth fiscal quarter's average rig revenue per day is approximately $28,300. The average rig expense per day level is expected to remain relatively flat at roughly $13,000 with a potential variance of a few percentage points given the slightly volatile nature of quarterly expenses.","Regarding our U.S. land term contract backlog, we already have term contract commitments for an average of 175 rigs for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and an average of 142 rigs for all of fiscal 2015. The average quarterly pricing level for these rigs that are already under term contracts is expected to be flat to slightly up during the corresponding 5 quarters. Should spot pricing improvements continue through fiscal 2015, we would expect our total average rig revenue per day for the segment to also continue to slightly increase, approaching and hopefully eventually exceeding the average pricing of rigs that are already under term contracts.","As John mentioned, the 74 contracted new builds announced since the beginning of our fiscal year represent yet another record for H&P. Of the 74 announced rigs, 32 are going to the Permian, 14 to the Oklahoma Woodford, 13 to the Eagle Ford, 4 to the Utica, 4 to the Bakken, 3 to the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, 2 to the Haynesville and 1 each to the Niobrara and Woodbine.","Of these 74 rigs, 48 are FlexRig3, 25 are FlexRig5 and 1 is a FlexRig4. Furthermore, about 2\/3 of the 74 rigs have skidding systems suitable for multi-well pad drilling. Of the 13 newly announced rigs, which are included in the 74, 6 are going to the Oklahoma Woodford, 3 to the Permian, 2 to the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and 1 each to the Eagle Ford and Woodbine. Of these 13 rigs, 5 are FlexRig3 and 8 are FlexRig5.","Let me now transition to our offshore segment where segment operating income declined as expected to approximately $17 million. The average rig margin per day declined to $24,303 and utilization remained flat at 89%. Eight platform rigs were active in the quarter, and our ninth platform rig is being prepared to commence operations before the end of this calendar year.","As we look at the fourth fiscal quarter, we expect flat utilization levels and a decline in the average rig margin per day to approximately $22,000, primarily as the result of pricing adjustment -- of the pricing adjustment during the third fiscal quarter on 1 of the 8 active rigs as mentioned during our April conference call.","Additionally, management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $4 million, and it is expected to be slightly under that level during the fourth fiscal quarter and then increase to approximately $5 million or $6 million during each of the following quarters.","I will now transition to the international land segment, where segment operating income declined to $6.6 million as we experienced a lower average rig margin per day level as compared to the prior quarter, in addition to a $1.5 million currency exchange loss, which was mostly related to 2 countries in South America. Revenue days were roughly flat for an average of 22 active rigs. The average rig margin per day was $9,324 during the quarter.","As of today, our international land segment has 23 active rigs, 15 of which are AC drive rigs. 7 of the active rigs are in Argentina, 5 in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador, 3 in Bahrain, 2 in the UAE and 1 in Mozambique. A total of 8 rigs are currently idle in the segment, 3 of which are in Colombia, 2 in Tunisia, 2 in Argentina and 1 in Ecuador.","For the fourth fiscal quarter, we expect international land revenue days to be up by approximately 2% as compared to the third fiscal quarter. The corresponding average rig margin per day is expected to be down by approximately 5%, also as compared to the prior quarter. We believe that the margin weakness in the segment is temporary, due to several rigs that are either in transition from country to country or starting up operations.","Given weak market conditions in Tunisia, we plan to move our 2 rigs out of that market. Separately, we have 2 new projects, 1 in Mozambique and 1 in Colombia, where 2 rigs recently commenced operations. The 10 rigs deploying to Argentina from the U.S. are expected to commence operations during the first half of fiscal 2015. We expect to see the full impact of these new projects by the third quarter of fiscal 2015.","Transitioning from drilling segment-related information, I will now comment on other items. The company's total fiscal 2014 capital expenditures will probably be lower than our $1.1 billion estimate, primarily as a result of the timing of procurement related to our ongoing new build efforts. We are still in position to fully fund our fiscal 2014 CapEx program, as well as other scheduled commitments, from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities. We now expect total depreciation expense for fiscal 2014 to be 1% to 2% higher as compared to our original estimate of $500 million. This increase is attributable primarily to a higher-than-expected FlexRig construction and deployment cadence during the second half of the fiscal year. General and administrative expenses were higher than expected during the third fiscal quarter but are expected to come down during the fourth fiscal quarter.","Total general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year are now expected to be 2% to 3% higher as compared to our original estimate of $130 million. Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2014 is expected to be slightly over 35%.","As it relates to our investment portfolio, the company sold another 250,000 shares of its Schlumberger holdings for total proceeds of over $25 million that favorably impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.13 in the quarter. Our remaining investment portfolio recently had a pretax market value of approximately $250 million and an after-tax value of approximately $155 million.","And that concludes our prepared comments. Zach, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, the build cadence going from 2 to 3 to 4, what do you figure is the max rate? Is 4 a month it? Or could you go even higher?","John W. Lindsay","Well I think there's the potential for us to go higher. We've talked about it a few times in the past. Each time we've increased the cadence, obviously, it's a function of a demand pull from customers. We haven't ever been at 5. I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks that this is the -- this will be the third time that we've been at that 4 month -- 4 rigs a month cadence. So it is possible, but it's going to be a function of having the demand there, having the supply chain there. And again, I think we have the capability to do that. Our guys do a great job, and I think they could get to that level assuming we've got enough strength in the market.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then Juan Pablo, for you on the working capital, again running pretty high, 8% of revenue for the second quarter -- I guess it was 6% last quarter. Is that inventory purchases on components? Or is that receivables-related?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Mostly receivables, Michael. But it does include several other items of course.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But it shouldn't...","Juan Pablo Tardio","But there's nothing there that we see that is inconsistent with the structure that we've seen in the past in general or what we might expect going forward.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it's -- I should think about it more as volatility, not run rates in -- at that kind of level.","Juan Pablo Tardio","I think that's reasonable.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just out of curiosity, when I look at the cash flow, you all have referred to using the balance sheet in the past for growth. But not being an acquisition-oriented company and now building at the max rate of 4 a month -- or historical max rate of 4 a month and still being effectively cash flow neutral from a free cash flow standpoint, I was just wondering about your willingness or appetite for using the balance sheet to repurchase stock.","John W. Lindsay","Well, Michael, we have -- of course you recall, we have repurchased stock in the past. So that obviously is, as we talk about this \"all of the above\" strategy, that's one of the strategies that we've implemented in the past. We're -- we continue to have an opportunistic-type view, and we think at this stage the most effective way to return value to shareholders is through cash back to shareholders versus buying back shares at this time. That's just -- that's been our position","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And keeping the balance sheet essentially 0 debt?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I'm trying to remember, Juan Pablo, in the past, we've been as high as 20%?","Juan Pablo Tardio","20%.","John W. Lindsay","20%.","Juan Pablo Tardio","[indiscernible]","John W. Lindsay","You know this business well. You've followed it a long time. It's a very cyclical business, and as drilling contractors, I think we don't necessarily have a goal of being debt free. But we would look at it in terms of being opportunistic. And in making -- whether it would be in acquisition, you mentioned that, we've talked about that as well, Michael. Acquisition of a land contractor would be dilutive so that isn't something. But there are other opportunities out there, but we're just going to continue to keep our eyes open and look for opportunities to grow the company and -- anything else, Juan Pablo, to add?","Juan Pablo Tardio","It's good to be in a position to have a very strong balance sheet to be able to take advantage of any opportunities that may come up.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kurt Hallead with RBC.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just your commentary about the pricing progression as you head out into fiscal 2015. If I heard you correctly, you indicated that current spot pricing is about 4% below those rigs that have already been under contract, but on a go-forward basis, you would expect that the pricing improvements will start to lift the average rig rate. Now can you help me connect the dots? Does that generally mean that you think over the course of the next few quarters that the spot pricing dynamic will then be above what your historical high had been? Could you just give us some color? So if spot market is 4% below term contract right now, if you look at the exit rate for fiscal '15, do you think that spot pricing could be above -- 5% above or 4% above? Can you just give us some color on that?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Kurt. This is Juan Pablo. I think you read exactly what we were trying to communicate, and that is that spot pricing is still about 4% under where we've seen it over the last few years in stronger markets. And so hopefully, spot pricing continues to improve as we've seen it over the last few months. And if that is the case, we would not be surprised if we once again reach the prior peak in terms of spot pricing, which would be approximately 4% over where we are today. The timing of that depends of course on market conditions, but over the next several quarters, it would not be surprising to see us get to that point. And as you mentioned, if that were to happen and everything else being held more or less equal, we would expect the total average rig revenue per day in this segment to be slightly up as well. So we're optimistic about the market and we hope that, that is the case.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And maybe my follow-up then, just on the international front. You indicated that the Argentina rigs will be at full impact by the third fiscal quarter of 2015. So should we assume a -- when we think about the increase in the number of rigs, so 5 rigs maybe in the fiscal first quarter and then the remaining 5 in the fiscal second quarter so that you're at full run rate? Or is it going to be spread out a little bit more than that?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Well, not -- I think that your expectation is reasonable. Of course, the rigs will be deployed at approximately, roughly speaking, 1 per month or so, so they will be spread out during that 6-month period. It's obviously less than 1 per month -- excuse me, 1 for every 20 days or so. And so if you go through that, I think that's a reasonable way of modeling it. And by the time we get to the third fiscal quarter of '15, hopefully all of those rigs will be operating and generating the types of margins that we expect.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then in that context, on the margin dynamic, you said a temporary decline in margins given some rig moves and startups. So is the rig margin then from the fiscal fourth quarter into the first half of '15, are we going to start to see improvement at that point? Or is it more like a second half of fiscal '15 when we start to see some margin improvement internationally?","Juan Pablo Tardio","It's hard to say at this point, Kurt. We're certainly going to be keeping everybody updated on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It depends on a lot of moving variables and on market conditions for rigs that are in the spot market, et cetera. But in general, after the decline in margins that we've provided as an expectation for the fourth fiscal quarter, our hope is to start seeing improvements and then by the second fiscal -- excuse me, by the third fiscal quarter of 2015, we would hope that margins are significantly higher than where they are today and where we expect them to be in the fourth fiscal quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Walt Chancellor with Macquarie.","Walter Chancellor - Macquarie Research","I guess staying internationally, in Argentina there've been some -- obviously, some recent labor issues and then this default. It's clearly a great resource in place. How are you all feeling about the market opportunity there, I guess now versus when you initially sign those contracts? And then if you could talk about sort of what your protections are within those contracts to sort of be kept whole on margin.","John W. Lindsay","Walt, this is John. I'll talk about the opportunity. I don't think anyone is surprised. I mean this default has been out. It's been discussed for, I don't know, for how long, but I know it was being talked about prior to the bid. And so that -- we knew that was out there and a potential. We still don't understand exactly how or if it will impact us. We looked at Argentina and YPF in general as a long-term opportunity. These are 5-year term contracts. And clearly the resource is strong, and we think the opportunity is out there to grow the fleet pretty significantly. And it's not just with YPF, it's with other international oil companies as well. So are we disappointed? Yes, we're disappointed. And does it really change the outlook? I don't really think that it does. Again, it was one of the factors, we knew that it was a potential situation. And what was the second half of your question?","Walter Chancellor - Macquarie Research","Just how you feel about those contracts? Is there any change or sort of protections for these maybe unexpected or expected events over the course of that 5 years?","John W. Lindsay","Right. Well, we've talked in the past that we felt like these were really good contracts, and we still stand by that. These are good contracts. We've said before they're not risk-free. I mean working internationally has its own set of risks and challenges, as we all know. So we feel good about it, and we feel like -- in fact, we're in a good position, and we're just working on the execution part of the contract right now.","Walter Chancellor - Macquarie Research","Great. And then to follow up, certainly a company strength, we continue to see E&P is talking up sequential improvements in drilling efficiency, especially in these Q2 results. I'm just wondering, what you're seeing with your fleet year-to-date? I know the rate of improvement is tapered a bit for you guys in the last year. Just what you're seeing thus far in calendar 2014?","John W. Lindsay","Well, we do continue to see efficiency improvements, but as you said, it's the year-over-year improvements are less because of the starting point from the year before. And the -- but the exception would be the Permian because the mix shift of verticals to horizontal. I think there's a great opportunity and great upside -- pardon me -- to continue to improve in Permian, and that's what we're seeing. So part of the overall fleet, Permian pulled that down just little bit if you look at it from a just a year-to-year improvement. I think Permian is setting it up for some great opportunities. But a lot of the low-hanging fruit opportunities, I think, are gone. But there's still a lot of other things that we're working on. I think the reliability, we continue to talk about reliability. Customers are very interested in that and just reliably drilling wells and being consistent.","Operator","We'll go next to Brad Handler from Jefferies.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a little more color, please, on the challenges related to ramping cadence. Is that -- and maybe it's broadly we can think about labor challenges, perhaps, and you can speak to that to some degree. I know you obviously have a great pool to work from in your existing workforce. But to what extent are you, as you watch your peers also try to ramp up their cadence, to what extent do you think they'll -- to what extent do you think the industry can kind of find enough able-bodied people to get the job done if we're looking out 6 months and 12 months from now?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think if -- at least from my perspective, there's a couple of questions in there. I don't feel like our cadence is limited by the labor, by our personnel. We have great people. We have a really strong bench and a lot of opportunities for people to continue to grow. Obviously, 4 rigs a month today at the size of the organization we are, compared to 4 rigs per month in 2006 and 2007 from a growth perspective is much different, a greater challenge for the organization. So I feel really good about our field operation and us having a good group of guys to continue to draw upon. I think that really the challenge is going to tend to be in the supply chain. I think that's what everybody is going to face. In 2012, the best we can tell, I think that the industry delivered around 150 new AC rigs. Last year, I think it was between 60 and 70. This year, we thought it was going to be around 100, 110. I think it's going to be probably closer to 120 to 130. And so obviously, 2015 is setting up to have a higher number than that, higher than the 150. So I think that's where the real challenge is. Because if you consider the overall Baker Hughes rig count today and contrast that with previous cycles, I -- again, I don't think it's a function of a constrain on people so much as it is on the supply chain in just being able to get the rigs out. And I think the other challenge, of course, is building them, building the rig at a reasonable cost to be able to get a reasonable rate of return on your investment.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I appreciate the redirect. That's part of it -- that's part of the question anyway, is the prioritization, so that's helpful. I guess the -- at the risk of sounding like I'm not listening, but I am, I'm curious if there are wage pressures in -- that are building in your business now. And as we think about net margin improvements relative to your pricing commentary, whether there's a lot -- there's some cost offsets we need to be aware off?","John W. Lindsay","Well, yes, anytime of course, Brad, when you get this kind of activity, there's the potential for wage increases. We haven't had a wage increase recently, but obviously that's a possibility in the future. Keep in mind that our contracts have -- a provision in the contract to cover labor increases, so it's a pass-through. So while it is a cost increase for us, we get a corresponding revenue to offset the cost.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Marietta with Stephens.","Matthew Marietta - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just one from me. I wanted to hit on the international business a little bit. When you look at the international prospects, it's obviously good to move rigs and beneficial for you guys to move rigs and help with overall fleet utilization. But what about the new build potential or any new designs that you may be working on to meet customer demand as they develop deeper targets or different international-type drilling?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Matt, I think your sense is right. I think there are opportunities for us internationally, both FlexRigs and deeper rigs as well -- or deeper horizon-type rigs. We've continued to believe that the real opportunity, at least for H&P internationally, is this move towards unconventional drilling, towards more of a resource development-type move because of the efficiency and the experience that we have related to FlexRigs and working in the resource plays. And I think that speaks to the opportunity with YPF in Argentina and that's what YPF saw. And so our belief is that's where our international growth opportunity is going to be in the future. And from a new build perspective, as long as the market is as strong as it is in the U.S. I mean there's no stronger market in the world, at least from our perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a return on invested capital perspective, we think this is the best market to be plowing our capital back into for the new build. And so as we talked about before, we're getting to 4. Is there enough demand to reach 5? I think at this stage of the game, it would make more sense to direct those new dollars, new rigs towards the U.S. market as opposed to international just because of -- again, because of the rates of return and the risk profile.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have another question from Walt Chancellor with Macquarie.","Walter Chancellor - Macquarie Research","As the new build market sort of tightens up and your competitors take on incremental orders, are you all seeing the opportunity to maybe push for more term in using your build -- new build deals? Or on the other hand, are you seeing customers push for longer terms? And if not, is that a direction you could see things turning on the new build front?","John W. Lindsay","Walt, that's a great question. And as these cycles -- again, as a third round, that tends to be the progression is term contracts have a tendency to get longer. We've -- over time, we've had a target of 3 years, but in previous cycles, we've had 4- and 5-year term contracts. And so I think that's a possibility to do that. We're not necessarily pushing on that, but a lot of times the push ends up coming from the customer. They want to make certain they've got the rig and they got it locked up, which obviously from a contractor perspective, that's the place to be. You want to hear your customers talking about long-term activity and outlook. So again, it's a good observation I think it is possible. We're not pushing hard on that effort right now, but I do think it's possible.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mike Breard with Hodges Capital.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","Could you please comment on what the day rate is on a new FlexRig order today versus what it was on one order back in October?","John W. Lindsay","Oh, Mike, for competitive reasons, I prefer not to go there, Mike. It is, suffice to say, it is -- the rates have improved. And -- but I prefer not to give an exact number. But the pricing has continued to improve, and I would expect that it will continue to improve going forward as long as commodity prices remain strong.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Andrew Shirley [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Have you guys analyzed the formation of an MLP? And if so what are your thoughts at this point?","Juan Pablo Tardio","This is Juan Pablo. Andrew [ph], we certainly have looked at what the industry has done and what those structures look like in general. We don't believe that it is a type of structure that applies to contract drillers in the land drilling business. So we really are not further investigating that option.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] It appears we have no further questions at this time.","Juan Pablo Tardio","All right.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Justin, and welcome, everyone, to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast corresponding to the fourth quarter and fiscal year end of 2013. With us today are Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO; and John Lindsay, President and COO.","As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to Hans Helmerich.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thank you, Juan Pablo. Good morning. We are pleased to have posted all-time record earnings and revenues for the company's year-end results. It's a credit to our folks that they achieved this milestone during a year when the overall land drilling industry experienced activity declines and lower day rates.","Looking back over the year, we estimate the industry delivered around 80 new AC drive rigs to the domestic market. These rigs predictably pushed the lower performing rigs to the sideline and now, represent nearly 50% of rigs working today in unconventional basins. As this percentage continues to grow, we often receive questions from investors related to a narrative around a narrowing gap in terms of competitive overall rig offering in the land drilling space. The questions are fair and intuitively make sense. Some impending parity over an 8-year period should be expected. I say 8 years because, in 2005, our largest competitor announced a counter-offensive of the new build effort and we no longer had the AC drive rig market to ourselves. Not surprisingly, others followed. And eventually, nearly 11 years after the Flex 3 AC drive debut, every sizable land contractor, including a couple of startups, were talking up the virtues of their AC rig offering.","In our thinking, after years of enjoying a first-mover advantage, the greater challenge was to focus our efforts to establish a sustainable one. Our conviction was that the customer would differentiate and pay for outstanding field execution, improving efficiencies and ongoing innovation and performance enhancements. Our people throughout the organization have delivered on each one of these, and our financial results over the years have reflected their success, as the FlexRig remains today the rig of choice. Our 2013 fiscal year performance provides an additional test case for how we are doing in an effort to stay ahead of the pack.","Even in a challenging U.S. land environment, we managed to increase our revenue days during fiscal 2013 by 3% as compared to 2012 fiscal year. While that may sound like a modest amount, it stands in contrast to our 3 largest peers, experiencing a combined decline of over 15% during the same time frame. More impressively, we delivered to shareholders this market share growth at daily cash margins that, during fiscal 2013, were over 60% greater than the average combined cash margin of our top 3 competitors. The resulting operating income in the segment for H&P was over 3x larger than the average operating income of our top 3 competitors, and significantly greater than the cumulative sum of all 3. We've been able to combine our over 1,300 rig years of experience with AC drive technology in the field with our ability to internally design and build what we believe is a better land rig for less money.","The combination of these advantages have allowed the company to deliver a 15% return on equity during fiscal 2013 as compared to our 3 largest peers, delivering returns that are close to 1\/2 that mark, even excluding their write-offs and extraordinary expenses from these calculations.","While we have an abiding respect for the competitive nature of this work, the industry's challenge is in the daily rigor required from all of its players. All of us will continue to build new rigs and the whole industry will become safer and more efficient because operators will set the bar higher. But we doubt it will be a world of parity and sameness. Differentiated performance still adds tangible value and will be rewarded accordingly.","We like our chances of continuing our success going forward. During the last few months, we've talked about encouraging signs in the market, and we're pleased with the 13 total new build orders with long-term contracts, including those announced today, that we have secured since October 1, the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year.","This new book of business will achieve attractive financial returns, similar to the business model we have discussed in previous years. Generally, we target a range from the mid- to upper-teens, fully taxed, annual ROIC, with an after-tax contractual paybacks on a cash-on-cash basis of around 90% during typical 3-year term contract. Further, we are encouraged by ongoing conversations that we're currently having with customers for additional new build orders.","Our plans today anticipate an ongoing cadence of 2 rigs per month for our 2014 fiscal year, but depending on market demand, we have flexibility to increase that production as we move ahead. We believe this approach will continue to reward our shareholders. And as I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, I'm very appreciative to all the people in the company that contribute to our ongoing success. Juan Pablo?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $957 million of operating income of for fiscal 2013. We also reported record levels of $737 million of net income and $3.4 billion of revenue for the fiscal year.","Our capital expenditures totaled $809 million during fiscal 2013, and our corresponding estimate for fiscal 2014 is $850 million. The fiscal 2013 total of $809 million was lower than expected as a result of underbudget delivery of new rigs during 2013, along with the timing of some spending that shifted forward to fiscal 2014. Over 1\/2 of the $850 million CapEx estimate for fiscal 2014 corresponds to our new build program, approximately 1\/3 to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to tubular and other process[ph] .","Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1 billion during fiscal 2013. We expect, at this point, to be able to fully fund our fiscal 2014 CapEx program, as well as other scheduled commitments from existing cash and cash -- and from cash to be provided by operating activities during the fiscal year. Our confidence in our ability to do this is enhanced by the fact that we already have secured term contract commitments for an average of approximately 148 rigs during fiscal 2014 and 81 rigs during fiscal 2015. Approximately 90% of those rigs correspond to our U.S. land segment and provide the company with the benefit of an average pricing level that, as described during our last conference call, is about 5% to 10% higher than current spot market pricing.","Moreover, as some of our rigs that are under term contracts roll off these contracts and as announced new builds are deployed under new term contracts, we expect the average pricing of remaining rigs that are currently under term contract to slightly increase during fiscal 2014.","As reported in our consolidated financial statements, depreciation expense for fiscal 2013 was approximately $456 million. Given the continuing growth of our fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $500 million during fiscal 2014. General and administrative expenses are expected to slightly increase to approximately $130 million. And interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to increase, but remain under $10 million during the fiscal year.","Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2013 was reported at approximately 35.3%. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 to be between 35% and 36%. Also, similarly to fiscal 2013, we expect only a modest deferral of income taxes during fiscal 2014.","As it relates to our investment portfolio, the holdings remain unchanged compared to the prior quarter.","I will now turn the call over to John, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. While many industry observers are uncertain regarding a meaningful improvement in the U.S. land rig count for the coming months, the industry's AC drive rig count has continued to march higher. In fact, over the past 12 months, the AC rig count is up approximately 120 rigs, while the combined SCR and mechanical rig count is down over 130 rigs.","The reason for this replacement cycle is well known. E&P companies are drilling a larger percentage of unconventional horizontal wells, and the complexity factor of unconventional wells is much higher than a vertical well.","In addition to greater well complexity, E&Ps are also expecting enhanced efficiencies from contractors. And that is the reason why advanced technology AC drive rigs, and specifically, the industry leader, FlexRig, should continue to grow market share.","Customers continue to be results-oriented, and there is a differentiation in performance across all rig types. We believe our results demonstrate that H&P is the best positioned to lead this replacement cycle. We are convinced we have the best personnel, technology and systems that provide the reliability and efficiencies customers are looking for.","Now I will make a few comments regarding each of our operating segments, and I'll begin with our U.S. land activity. The quarter was better than expected, with approximately 245 average active rigs as a result of improving market conditions. An average of approximately 156 rigs were active under term contracts, while an average of approximately 89 rigs were active in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day also exceeded expectations during the quarter and increased to $29,058 a day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $740 (sic) [$730] per day in the fourth fiscal quarter.","Average rig expense per day was higher than expected and increased to $13,638 per day, primarily as a result of maintenance and supply expenses associated with multiple rig start-ups, in addition to expenses associated with increased revenues. Average rig margin per day remained relatively flat at $15,420 for the fourth quarter.","We are pleased with the improvement in the U.S. land market and customer demand for new FlexRigs. You may have read in our press release, we entered into agreements with 3 exploration and production companies to build and operate 6 additional FlexRigs in the U.S. Including the 7 new builds announced in October 1, we have a total of 13 new FlexRigs contracted under multi-year term contracts so far in the first fiscal quarter. These rigs are expected to generate attractive economic returns for the company.","A few more details on the 13 new builds contracted this quarter that wasn't included in the press release. We contracted the 13 rigs to 5 customers, a mix of long-term and new customers. The FlexRigs models contracted included 7 FlexRig3s, 5 Flex 5s and 1 FlexRig4. By geographic basin, 8 of the rigs are contracted to the Permian, 2 each for the Bakken and the Eagle Ford and 1 for the Niobrara. Ten of the FlexRigs are equipped with hydraulic skid systems designed for efficient pad drilling. Currently, our active AC FlexRig fleet has approximately 1\/2 of the rigs drilling on pads. Since 2006, we've drilled over 6,500 wells from over 1,500 pad locations with our hydraulic skid systems. Four of the 13 contracted new builds have already started operations. Four more will begin operations in the first fiscal quarter, and the remaining 5 in the second quarter.","A few comments about how we see the U.S. land new build market going forward. You may recall, we didn't have any new build contracts to announce on our July call. This was mostly attributable to the fact that market day rates and term contracts this summer wouldn't deliver the rates of returns we have historically achieved. So we were patient waiting for the market to improve. Our ability to build FlexRigs at a reliable cadence and cost has allowed us to respond very quickly to the new build demand we witnessed over the past 45 to 60 days. We've demonstrated the flexibility to build long-lead capital spares and convert those into new FlexRigs as needed, to respond to customer demand and an improving outlook.","Today, we have 255 active rigs, including 156 rigs under term contracts and 99 operating in the spot market. All active rigs are AC drive FlexRigs.","Our U.S. land fleet utilization today is 84% with 48 idle rigs. However, our AC utilization has improved to 94%, with only 15 idle AC drive rigs today. The 3 most active basins of activity for us are the Eagle Ford with 79 rigs, the Permian with 54 rigs and the Bakken with 34 rigs.","As evidenced by our new build announcements, our Permian activity has improved the most during 2013, up over 80% during the past 12 months. With the new build commitments we have today, we could have over 60 rigs running in the Permian in the second quarter of 2014 and there appears to be additional upside from there.","Looking at our U.S. land outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2014, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 3% as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of '13. We expect the average rig revenue per day to be flat to slightly down, and average rig expense per day at roughly $13,000 per day, plus or minus a few percentage points, as compared with the fourth quarter.","We are pleased with the direction of the U.S. land market today, as day rates have strengthened in both the spot market and term contracts.","In addition to experiencing an uptick in new build demand, our idle AC rig count is at the lowest level since the third fiscal quarter of 2012. You will recall, that was just ahead of the industry activity pullback in the fall of last year. Another indication we are seeing of market strength today, of our 15 idle AC rigs, 9 are already committed for upcoming work.","Now a few comments regarding the offshore segment results for the fourth fiscal quarter. Revenue days were in line with our expectations. However, our operating income had a shortfall as a result of a $6.4 million charge related to events the company discovered in 2010. Excluding that charge, margin per day would have increased by $1,569 sequentially, to $26,677 a day.","Now looking at the outlook for our offshore segment. As of today, the segment has 8 rigs active and 1 rig stacked. We expect 8 rigs to remain active throughout the first fiscal quarter of 2014. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to be flat and margin to be approximately $25,000 per day.","Turning to our international land segment, where operating income of $13.9 million exceeded expectations as a result of better-than-expected margins and higher revenue days. Today, the international land segment has 23 rigs working, of which 13 are AC drive FlexRigs. Of the active rigs today, 8 are in Argentina, 5 each in Colombia and Ecuador, 2 each in Bahrain and the UAE, and 1 in Tunisia. A total of 6 rigs are idle in the following countries: 2 in Colombia and 1 in Argentina, Bahrain, Tunisia and Ecuador.","As a result of these activity levels, we expect international land revenue days to decline by approximately 10%, and margin should be flat quarter-to-quarter. So while the quarterly rig activity is softer than expected, we remain bullish, long term, on international growth opportunities. We believe the driver of that growth will occur when unconventional resource plays gain more traction globally. With H&P's 50-plus years of international experience, coupled with FlexRig efficiency and expertise, we believe larger-scale customer adoption of our service offering in international markets is likely.","Now in closing, even in the face of a challenging rig market like we've experienced over the past year, we've been able to grow our market share and deliver the highest levels of rig efficiencies and safety performance in the industry.","I would like to thank all of our field personnel, office staff and management teams for an outstanding 2013 fiscal year. All of these achievements that have been accomplished are possible because of our people's commitment to the company's vision of providing safe, efficient and cost-effective performance for our customers.","That completes my operating segment remarks, and now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. And Justin, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Robin Shoemaker.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question, John, would be just in terms of the strength you're seeing in spot and term prices for FlexRigs, we're see -- I guess, we're seeing that overall kind of a flattish rig count. And so what would you, I mean, attribute the strength you're seeing in spot and term rates today? Is it in anticipation of stronger demand or -- so kind of what's your outlook for the overall rig count?","John W. Lindsay","Okay, Robin. Well, overall and historically, in this business, we've focused our attention on the industry, the overall industry rig count. It was a much better barometer, I think, of demand than what it is today. And Hans and I both have tried to address that in -- when you consider the premium end of the market, if you consider the AC drive section of the market and if you look at the overall utilization of AC rigs in U.S. land, even though there's between 70 and 80 rigs stacked today, the utilization is still 90% or so. So there's a pretty clear level of pricing power that's there. I mean, as evidenced by new build announcements, I think there's an opportunity, and we've seen, I guess, over the last 60 days or so, 90 days -- 60 or 90 days or so, we've seen more of the spot market price firm and we've actually seen a little bit of pricing power. So I think that's why we see it. And again, I know it's -- when you look at the overall rig count trending sideways, it's hard to see that there would be pricing power. But I think if you look at the premium end of the market, that's where we see the pricing power.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Okay, understood. So now in terms of your success in holding down or, actually, possibly lowering operating costs of rigs, is this tied into the greater prevalence of pad-type drilling? More -- less downtime, more efficient utilization related to pad drilling? Or other factors?","John W. Lindsay","Rob, I don't want to make certain -- I understand your question. You were talking about our costs like over the last 12 months?","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, just the holding down of cost escalation on a daily operating per rig basis.","John W. Lindsay","Well, we really haven't considered the pad drilling aspect necessarily, at least what we've seen, on our cost controls. I would say our cost controls are more a function of our systems and our processes that we've had in place or that we have in place and that we've improved, and our people's focus on that. Because whether we're drilling on pads or whether we're drilling on single-well locations, the fact is the rigs are working much harder today than a rig has ever worked. I mean, the lateral links, the hydraulic horsepower requirements, the cycle times. Sure, I think there would be -- there could be an argument to be made that if you're moving the rig less frequently with trucks, there's going to be some savings in costs. But I think, at least for us, I'm speaking for H&P, I think our cost effectiveness has been more a function of our process improvement and our uniform fleet, the fact that all we're working are Flex 3s, 4s and 5s. I think, that's really what drives our efficiencies.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Hans, John, Juan Pablo and to your entire company, I don't usually do this, but you guys are a class act and congratulations on setting a record in a year where nobody would have expected it. So from the industry perspective, you guys are a class act. Good job. My question, if I could, you guys recently won a platform contract with Shell. Can you tell us about that?","Hans Christian Helmerich","I'm going to have John tell you about it. I wanted you to pause after that comment, and just let us kind of enjoy that a little bit. That was nice, Jim. Thanks.","John W. Lindsay","Jim, I fell out of -- well, thank you. And I fell out of my chair when you said it, so I'm trying to recover. What was your question again?","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You guys recently won a platform contract, I understand, with Shell, an offshore platform contract, is that right? Did I hear this right?","John W. Lindsay","That's right. Well, Jim, it's probably a pretty solid rumor, but at this stage of the game, we can't talk about it much. We'll have more clarity on our next call in January.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Typically, how big are the platform contract jobs that you do? What size horsepower rigs are those?","John W. Lindsay","They're 3,000 horsepower is most of what we're looking at.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And can you just give us a ballpark idea generally of what 3,000-horsepower platform rig day rates are? Just broadly.","John W. Lindsay","Well, yes, it's in line with what we have. It's probably high $50,000, low $60,000-a-day range.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ryan Fitzgibbon from Global Hunter.","Ryan Fitzgibbon - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","First one for me is on your contracting strategy at this point. Your spot exposure has gone up a bit, I imagine that coincides with better pricing in the spot market. Can you talk about how you expect your spot exposure to trend going into '14 given, I would expect, some of the operators are looking to lock in rigs, first? And then second, can you quantify how spot market rates actually change quarter-on-quarter for you guys?","John W. Lindsay","Ryan, this is John. I'll talk a little bit about the spot market. I'm going to have Juan Pablo address your last part of your question. You're right, our percentage of spot market rigs is higher than it has been trending over the last couple of quarters. I would expect to see our -- I would expect to see more of the spot market -- some of the spot market rigs rolling to term contracts. As far as our strategy, we're going to -- we're really going to do what the customer's demands are. I mean, if they're wanting to enter into term contracts, then we're going to be willing to do that. Obviously, if you look at it historically, we've been satisfied in that -- kind of that 50-50 range. Over the last year or so, I think we've been higher, where it's been 2\/3 and 1\/3. So we're going to be comfortable in that 50% to 65% range. We're not really concerned about it one way or the other. But I do think with the market tightening little bit, I would expect to see more of the spot market rigs going into term.","Juan Pablo Tardio","And this is Juan Pablo. To your question regarding spot market rates and how those have evolved. As you know, at the beginning of the year, we saw a little softness there and we had a slight decline since then. From the June quarter to September quarter, we experienced a very slight decline in pricing and average revenue per day for rigs in the spot market. Going forward, we hope that, that changes. Our expectation is for spot pricing, in general, to be slightly up, or flat to slightly up. There are other moving variables as well in terms of where those rigs might be working and what kind of pricing structure -- cost structure there might be in different regions. But in general, we expect a positive movement in terms of spot pricing going forward.","Ryan Fitzgibbon - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","And Juan Pablo, I believe, in your opening remarks, you said 5% to 10% discrepancy there. Is it safe to assume, given the 12% discrepancy in the June quarter, it's at the high end of that 5% to 10% range right now?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, I wouldn't describe it as a discrepancy. I would just describe it as the difference between the pricing of our rigs that are under term contract and the pricing of our rigs that are in the spot market. And so as we see what we have in terms of results for the September quarter, it's fair to describe that the difference between those 2 categories is approximately 5% to 10%. As you can imagine, and as I think we have mentioned in the past, there are other considerations related to the mix of where the rigs are working and what type of rigs are under term and what type of rigs are in the spot market and so forth. But I don't want to get into much of that. It's way too many things that move, many variables that move at the same time. But in general terms, hopefully again, what we see is, going forward, that gap in terms of pricing, apples-to-apples pricing that is, start to reduce into fiscal 2014.","Ryan Fitzgibbon - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it, makes sense. Second question for me is on international bid opportunities. I believe, in last quarter's call, you mentioned there's a couple of tenders out in the Middle East you were looking at. Just help me to get some color as to how that's progressed throughout the quarter, maybe where your outlook is for 2014 on new build opportunities internationally.","John W. Lindsay","Ryan, we're still participating in tenders, both in South America and in the Middle East, and we don't have anything to announce at this stage. Our hope is that we'll be successful on some of those tenders. As compared to the U.S. market, the international market moves quite a bit slower. But we're hopeful that we'll have something. It's hard to say if it's going to be in the first part of 2014. I mean, we have all -- we would have all believed that our international activity would be higher than it is right now with the success we've had with FlexRigs working internationally, from an efficiency and safety perspective. But that's really all we have to update right now. We're upbeat about it. It's just moving fairly slow.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Brad Handler from Jefferies Securities.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe I'll start with day rates also, and I admit as I ask this question and probably it's going to feel to you like it's more to do about very small moves than anything else. But if you laid out maybe an academic mathematical process for us a quarter or 2 ago around rates, given your commentary today and given some of the positive stepping -- some of the positive hints that you're giving about rates, is that profile for how the average day rate through '14 progresses? Does that change? Does it become a little less flat to down modestly, a little more flat, say, for example? I'm just trying to pick up on where you're taking us.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Brad. This is Juan Pablo. You're exactly right. It was a comment based on a theoretical scenario, an academic-type scenario of what happens if everything else remains more or less equal and stock pricing remains flat through fiscal 2014. What might that do to the total average revenue per day in the U.S. land segment? And the answer to that was, well, it probably would impact it so that we would see a reduction of 1% to 2% or a couple of percentage points. I think that theoretical scenario is still true today. Of course, we could lay out a different scenario, and that scenario being what happens if we have spot pricing increase 5% to 10% to match what we have of our rigs under a term contract price, and how would that impact the total average revenue per day for fiscal 2014. And I think that the, again, theoretical answer to that scenario would be that we would see the opposite. We would see an increase of 1% to 2% in terms of our average revenue per day. Does that address your question, Brad?","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It does. It looks like you thought about that question, so that's helpful. Let me shift gears, please. There is something that I'm unfamiliar with and I'd love to understand it better. Although John didn't mention it in his prepared comments, you mentioned that the revenue per day in the fiscal fourth quarter was, I guess, positively impacted by customer-requested delivery delay fees. So I don't know if that wound up not being a big part of it, since John didn't mention it. But to the degree that it is, I'd like to understand that a little bit better. What are the dynamics there? For example, there's -- I assume the contract start has pushed out. That sounds like the purpose. Is it the same term? Does the rate get impacted? How prevalent is this in your contracts, et cetera?","John W. Lindsay","Brad, this is John. It's not very prevalent in terms of a percentage. As we think back really since 2008, 2009, we've had examples where customers have delayed deliveries. It doesn't happen very frequently. There is some compensation associated with the delay. And that's really -- I didn't feel like it was enough of a percentage of what we do to address it in the detailed comments. I thought the press release handled it very well. So it's not a very prevalent situation, particularly in a market like this, where it continues to be fairly strong.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. I suppose that addresses it, but before I just drop it all together, is there any hint in seeing it of whether it's a function of the customer seeing even greater efficiencies and therefore needing a little less rig? Is there a way to generalize some of the driver behind what you've seen here? Or perhaps you could attribute it to something else?","John W. Lindsay","I don't know the specifics. I don't think it's necessarily a function of efficiencies and having too many rigs. I guess it could be as it relates to a budget. But again, it's just part of a budget function that the customer has that they want to delay activity. And this is a U.S. land and an international situation. It's not just U.S. land.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian (sic) [Byron] Pope from Tudor, Pickering.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just one question for me, John. I was struck by your commentary about your down -- being down to 15 idle AC rigs, just given that it seems as though most of this calendar year you've been kind of bouncing around between 18 and 20 idle AC rigs. And so I guess the comment I was struck by was when you had mentioned 9 of those 15 idle AC rigs are already committed for work. So I was just hoping you could speak to the progression of when those 9 rigs go to work? Because it almost feels to me like you're getting the sense from E&P operators that, once again, to Q1 of next year your utilization is going to be fairly tight. So was just wondering if you could comment a little, provide some incremental color on when those rigs go back to work.","John W. Lindsay","Byron, that is -- what we were trying to express is, you're right, it's been over -- well, between 18 and 22 rigs since the third quarter call in '12. And again, we've made the point on previous calls, it's not the same 20 rigs. There's a churn that's going on. And I think on the last call, we had commented that it appeared that there were less rigs. And maybe it wasn't on the last call, maybe it was in some of our conferences in September and October. But there's just less customers giving rigs back to us. We're still putting rigs to work, but there's less rigs that are getting released. And so I think that's what we're seeing and so clearly, the demand has improved. We're seeing fewer customers releasing rigs, they're hanging onto their high-performing AC rigs. And we're in a position where we just have a handful of AC rigs that are available as existing rigs in our spot market. So we see that as a positive, and again, I think it could speak to a little bit more pricing power for us -- for us and others in the industry.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I think the way you've characterized it before is the idle rigs you've had have been spread across basins. So is it fair to think that this subtle shift in the mentality among E&P operators is fairly a broad -- across basins?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, we have been pleased. I mean, overall, we've had some nice contracting strength in really all of the basins. Clearly, Permian is a lot more active than any other basin. But yes, we've been pleased with getting nice response from all of them. So there -- we're seeing rigs in all the basins going back to work.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Becker from Bank of America.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, I want to hone in a little bit more in the Permian demand. You indicated H&P could be close to 60 by the second quarter, with upside to that number. What kind of upside are we talking about, particularly in the context of maybe infrastructure constraints and still a very low level of pad drilling taking place in that basin?","John W. Lindsay","You're right on the pad drilling, Doug. I think there's less than 20% of the wells out there are being drilled off a pad. So there's a lot of opportunity to improve. The 60 number that we've put out there is really just taking the new builds that are out there. We're having to assume that the current rigs are going to continue to work. We're obviously assuming that oil prices remain strong and we don't have a pullback anywhere, but -- so yes, we could see it at 60. But what you're seeing in the Permian at the same time is the Permian rig count's not -- the overall Permian rig count's not drilling. You've got your vertical rigs going down, your lower-end rigs being stacked. And so the question is, much like the overall industry rig count, what kind of a trade-out ratio happens? What kind of replacement ratio happens? Is it 1 for 1 or is it 1 for 1.5, whatever it may be. So it's difficult to really predict where the rig count is going. I think, it's going to be driven largely by the unconventionals and the horizontal rig count.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So if I understand what you're saying, not expecting a big increase in the overall rig count, just a continuation of that shift to the horizontal and presumably, H&P taking some additional market share in that context?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, I don't see how -- I don't -- I'm not aware, at least, that the vertical rig count for the lower end of the market in the Permian is going to do anything but -- Permian, the low end of the rig count's going to continue to reduce, best I can tell. And customers are going to want to drill more horizontal wells and the rigs out -- a lot of rigs out there just aren't qualified, capable of doing that type of work.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then Hans, just what would you need to see to accelerate the cadence of 2 new builds per month? Obviously, an improving market, but do you need to actually have a contract in hand? Or would you build a little bit in anticipation of that, given just the philosophy of and flexibility of using those -- that equipment ultimately for spares if a contract doesn't materialize?","Hans Christian Helmerich","I think, the 2 rig-per-month cadence that we have now, and we're talking about extending through the rest of our '14 fiscal year, is a good baseline. And the so I don't think we would reach for additional cadence without market demand and kind of a demand pull-through. So we like the conversations we're having today and some of the things we've talked about on the call. So I think, that's the approach we're taking.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Mike Breard from Hodges Capital Management.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","Just out of curiosity, how many customers are you working for now in the U.S. versus, say, 6 months ago or 12 months ago?","John W. Lindsay","Mike, I want to say our rig -- our total customer count is right at 50. I think that's right in the U.S. And that's probably up 10 customers over the last year. We've added quite a few new customers. We've had quite a few new customers in the Permian and the Eagle Ford. And several of those are smaller customers, smaller E&Ps. So that's been encouraging. As you know, most of our customers, a large percentage of our customers are majors and large independents. So it's been nice to do more work for some of the smaller independents.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","Okay. And then one last question, is your profit margin pretty much the same basin-by-basin? Or is there a significant difference anywhere?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Mike, this is Juan Pablo. In general, what happens is that we attain the same type of returns for new builds that go to different regions. But the difference might be related to what type of rigs are used in different regions. If we have, for example, a larger rig like a FlexRig5, we're going to have a larger day rate and a larger margin corresponding to that rig in order to yield the same level of returns that we expect, as Hans mentioned, given the higher level of investment. For areas where the need is for a much smaller rig, then the margins might be smaller in terms of cash margins. But in general, again, based on returns, I think they're equivalent, generally speaking.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","Okay, but 1 rig at 1 basin will be about the same as a similar rig in other basin?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, sir.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brad Handler from Jefferies.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Juan Pablo, maybe directed at you, a question about the CapEx. Are you comfortable splitting out how much capital is carrying into fiscal '14 from fiscal '13 that's driving the lower-than-expected CapEx number for fiscal '13?","Juan Pablo Tardio","In general terms, I'll be glad to do that. We had an $890 million estimate for fiscal '13 and the result was $809 million, as I mentioned earlier. And most of the difference between those numbers resulted from the shift in spending from one fiscal year to the other. At least I gave you some [indiscernible]","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Exposure is more than half, right, so -- okay. If I think about it -- I would love to -- go ahead.","Juan Pablo Tardio","As I mentioned also earlier, most of the rest was related to being under budget in terms of the construction of our new builds, which, again, was a great achievement internally, and we thank our people involved in the process for that.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understand. And I suppose, in fairness, that's what I was trying to get after in thinking about that structurally going forward. So in a way, I felt like I was sort of handing you an opportunity to describe that for us to some degree, but can I think about, I don't know, I guess I'll press you, is most -- can I think about 3 quarters of that shift being pushing things back into fiscal '14? Am I in the right ballpark?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, as I mentioned, I'd prefer not to be that detailed in responding to that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there appears to be no further questions.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Okay. Well, thank you very much, and good day to everybody.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program.

The speakers today will be John Lindsay, President and CEO; and me, Juan Pablo Tardio. Also with us today is Dave Hardie, Manager of Investor Relations.","As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the page \u2013 on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Our first fiscal quarter results were better than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced daily rig expenses in our U.S. land segment. Unfortunately, U.S. land drilling activity has declined to levels not seen since 1999 as very low oil and gas prices are forcing customers to make further reductions in their drilling budgets.","The tone in 2016 has shifted to lower for longer. The industry has idled over 1,400 rigs in the U.S. since the peak rig count in October of 2014, and it continues to decline. Of those 1,400 rigs that have been idled, approximately 900 are legacy SCR and mechanical rigs, and approximately 500 are AC drive rigs. The industry is experiencing dramatic reductions in personnel and investments, and clearly, a number of companies are struggling to survive.","We are unable to predict the future, but prospective is necessary in both good and bad times. Recently, oil price has traded below $30 a barrel and a few pundits see the possibility of $20 oil. We are not predicting an immediate oil price improvement, but we do believe prices are below the level required to sustain a stable, let alone growing supply over a long period of time.","In the meantime, the capabilities of the oilfield service providers are being reduced significantly. At some point, the question will be who is in the best position for the eventual return of drilling demand. We believe that we will be well positioned and that this is simply not a time for us to hunker down and wait for things to get better. While continuing to thoughtfully manage costs, we will prudently invest in opportunities that will enhance the key competitive advantages we have as a company.","Let me talk briefly about a few of those opportunities. Our fleet profile is a competitive advantage as the FlexRig design allows us to provide a family of solutions for our customers. For several years now, the industry has been trending toward longer laterals, multi-well pads and generally, more complex well designs, which require AC drive rigs with 1,500 horsepower specifications. We have over 320 AC drive FlexRigs with 1,500 horsepower rating, and over 180 of those rigs are optimized for multi-well pad operations, and we continue to add 7,500 psi mud systems to a large portion of the fleet as well. The advanced fleet of FlexRigs supported by our organizational capabilities enables the company to remain laser focused on delivering wells safely, quickly and efficiently, while continuing to innovate by providing technology solutions and enhancing our service offering.","Our strategy has been successful, our market share in the U.S. has increased from 15% in 2014 to 18% today, and has doubled since 2008. We will also continue to invest in the organizational capability that I just mentioned. This means enhancing our best-in-class reputation for service and the way we create value for our customers. While our organizational infrastructure has been built over the past 10 years, we continue to make investments to improve and to leverage the learnings we capture from the fleet on a daily basis. This allows us to partner more closely with the customer to provide greater efficiencies, reliability, and safety. These improvements are all aimed at drilling the lowest cost well for our customers and maximizing the number of wells customers can deliver in a budget year. And finally, maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to cost management remain a company-wide priority. It is in times like these that the practice of maintaining a strong balance sheet becomes the key to future success. Along with this is having balanced perspective on cost management so that we're making prudent reductions that won't end up costing us more than the initial savings somewhere down the line. We're also rightsizing the organization along these same principles, with the end goal of enhancing our performance and developing opportunities for future growth.","Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, clearly, the first quarter of our 2016 fiscal year has been a very challenging start to the year. We are fortunate to have a very strong and liquid balance sheet, a firm backlog of term contracts, and the flexibility to significantly reduce spending levels during a soft market. Our approach to capital allocation will remain prudent and should allow us to effectively manage our business through this downturn and emerge from it with even greater competitive advantages.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, John. The company reported $16 million in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the deterioration of market conditions since late 2014, the average quarterly level of drilling activity for the company has continued to decline down 53% from last year's first fiscal quarter and down 11% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter.","Unfortunately, activity is expected to continue to significantly decline across our drilling segments during the second fiscal quarter. Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments.","Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $56 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days declined by 11.5% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 130 rigs generating revenue days during the first fiscal year \u2013 pardon me, during the first fiscal quarter.","On average, approximately 104 of these rigs were under term contracts, and approximately 26 rigs worked in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly increased to $26,234 in the first fiscal quarter, and the average rig expense per day significantly decreased by $933 to $12,890, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $13,344 in the first fiscal quarter.","The decline in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of continued efforts to reduce field overhead costs and direct operating costs on active rigs. H&P managers and employees across our organization deserve the credit for these very challenging and significant efforts.","Unfortunately, as I'll mention later \u2013 as I'll also mention later, we expect the per day impact of these ongoing efforts to be offset during the second fiscal quarter as our activity levels continue to decline. During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $29 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $78 million during the second fiscal quarter, about $77 million during the second half of fiscal 2016, and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues.","Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 77 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 17 rigs since our last conference call in mid-November. Total early termination revenues related to these 77 contracts are now estimated at approximately $429 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $166 million during fiscal 2016, and $175 million after that.","As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 121 rigs generating revenue and 226 idle rigs. Included in the 121 rigs generating revenue are 93 rigs under term contracts, 87 rigs of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 28 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 115 rigs generating revenue days in the segment.","Some rigs that generate revenue days are on standby type day rates. Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include six newbuild rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.","Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by close to 20% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to be roughly flat. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,600. This expected increase is primarily attributable to the relatively large number of rigs becoming idle during the quarter and impacting total expenses, which are then allocated to a smaller number of expected revenue days.","Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 87 rigs during the second fiscal quarter, 79 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2016, 66 rigs during fiscal 2017, and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018. The average pricing for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining newbuilds are deployed.","The average pricing for H&P rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 5% from last year's fourth fiscal quarter to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and may continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $8 million from $13 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days remain flat, and the average rig margin per day declined from $13,296 to $7,920 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The decline was mostly attributable to expenses associated with one rig mobilizing from shore to a new platform, a second rig moving from an operating rate to a lower standby type day rate, and some unexpected down time during the first quarter.","As we look at the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decline by 5% to 10%, and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $8,250 during the quarter. The expected changes are primarily attributable to the full effect of the previously mentioned day rate changes during the first quarter, and one rig expected to be demobilized and stacked onshore during the quarter.","Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter was approximately $6 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2016.","Moving on to our international land operations, the segment reported operating income of approximately $2 million during the first fiscal quarter, excluding a currency exchange loss of $8.5 million, which was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso during the quarter. As announced earlier today and starting this fiscal \u2013 this first fiscal quarter, the company eliminated a legacy one-month lag period between its U.S. fiscal year and its international operations' fiscal years.","In the past, fiscal years for the international operations ended on August 31 instead of September 30 to facilitate reporting of consolidated returns \u2013 that is of consolidated results. As required, the company applied the elimination of the one-month lag retrospectively to all periods presented in today's press release.","The average rig margin per day increased sequentially from $8,129 to $11,811 per day, excluding the impact of charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily a result of better than expected contribution from multiple rigs in different countries, including rigs that were working on relatively short-term contracts. Revenue days sequentially decreased to an average of 15.3 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter.","As of today, our international land segment have 14 active rigs, including 10 in Argentina, two in the UAE, one in Colombia and one in Bahrain. All 14 active rigs are under long term contracts. 24 rigs are idle, including nine in Argentina, seven in Colombia, six in Ecuador and two in Bahrain. We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down 5% to 10% during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.","The average rig margin per day is expected to decline to close to $7,500 per day, and no early termination revenues are expected during the second fiscal quarter in the segment. The expected decline in average rig margin is primarily attributable to the reduction in activity and to day rates for some of our contracted rigs moving from operating rates to standby type day rates.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our strong liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirement, is expected to allow us to sustain our regular dividend dollar per share levels, and our intent is to continue with that plan. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are still expected to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million.","Our FlexRig construction cadence plan remains generally the same with only a few contracted FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. Including these remaining long term contracts and combining all three of our drilling segments, we have an average of approximately 104 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 81 rigs in fiscal 2017, and 47 rigs in fiscal 2018. Given market conditions during the last several months and the early termination of additional long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015, to approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2015.","As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million.","The effective income tax rate for first quarter of fiscal 2016 was higher than expected, primarily as a result of adjustments related to the recent tax law change, extending bonus depreciation allowances that expired at the end of 2014. We expect that effective tax rate for each of the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 32% to 35%.","With that, let me turn the call back to John.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Juan Pablo. And before opening the call to Q&A, I want to reiterate the challenging oil and gas market today that may be on par with the oil market in the 1980s. But there are key differences, and one big difference is the age, size and capability of today's rig fleet. The AC drive rig replacement cycle of the legacy fleet is ongoing. At the peak of activity in 2014, approximately 41% of the fleet was AC drive, and today, over 63% of the active fleet is AC drive technology.","The remaining fleet is legacy SCR and mechanical rigs, and the question remains, what will be the marketable legacy fleet at the end of the downturn? We believe it will be a very small portion of the marketable fleet, and those rigs will have a very difficult time competing in the world of complex, unconventional horizontal wells.","And we will now open the call for questions, Keith.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we can take our first question from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Byron.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","John or Juan Pablo, I was struck by the cost side of the equation for your U.S. land operations and I realized there were a lot of moving pieces with more rigs being laid down in the March quarter, but it almost sounds as though you've gotten that average rig expense per day for typical FlexRig down to maybe a lower sustainable level. So again, I beg, I hear the March quarter guidance on the cost front, but is it fair to think that you've gotten that normalized cost down if you were to back out any cost associated with the rigs that will be laid down in the March quarter? I'm just trying to think about how that flows as we get deeper into this fiscal year and beyond?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Byron. This is Juan Pablo. I think that it is fair. However, we \u2013 going forward, it all depends on the number of idled rigs and active rigs, and the corresponding proportion, of course. In terms of how many idle rigs we will have, that will be subject to some small level of fixed expenses that will impact the total expenses that will then be allocated only among a very smaller or relatively small number of revenue days. As that denominator gets smaller, it just has an impact on the total average and that's what we see happening the following quarter. But I think your point is a good one that in general, we've made great strides as an organization to continue to reduce the average expense per active rig, it's just that the inactive ones are creating some volatility.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Byron, this is John. Juan Pablo said it in his comments that the guys in the field have worked really, really hard to get those costs down and they have, they've done a great job, but like Juan Pablo said, there is the denominator is a smaller number of days to spread those costs over. And I think \u2013 but there is also things that we're working on related to just costs on the supply chain side. There's a lot of things that we're excited about working on, but again, obviously, we've got a large number of rigs that are idle today.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Byron.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Byron.","Operator","We can take our next question from John Daniel with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","John Matthew Daniel - Simmons & Co. International","Hey, guys. John, there's lots of \u2013 at this point in the cycle, we get all sorts of various field anecdotes. And we try to figure out what's true, what's not true, but people call in and say, hey, Tier 1 rig rates are now $15,000 staying below. As we think about your spot rig portfolio's day rate assumptions as we enter the third fiscal quarter, would we be wildly off if we're to use that type of day rate assumption?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Are you saying \u2013 John, I want to be certain I understood the question correctly. You're saying that in the third quarter of 2016?","John Matthew Daniel - Simmons & Co. International","Well, second calendar quarter, right? Third fiscal quarter for you guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","John Matthew Daniel - Simmons & Co. International","Because I know you've given guidance for the current quarter. And so, I'm just trying to \u2013 and I also understand you guys have the revenue per day that's not day rate related, too, so I mean it's not a...","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","John Matthew Daniel - Simmons & Co. International","...a true apples-to-apples. So, I'm just \u2013 I'm trying to separate sort of what we hear from the field versus what we...","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","John Matthew Daniel - Simmons & Co. International","... should be expecting. That's all.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, and I hear you, there is a lot of just anecdotal comments out there. I think from our perspective, we've kind of summarized it as mid-to-high teens, and there is various different things that move that rate up and down as it relates to rig capability, whether it has a third mud pump or 7,500 psi, or whether it has a pad application. I mean, there is a lot of things that drive that, but I don't think what you are saying is unreasonable in a $16,000, $17,000 $18,000 a day range, again, depending on the rig and where it's working.","John Matthew Daniel - Simmons & Co. International","Okay. Fair enough. And Juan Pablo, I know you guys had given guidance beyond the current quarter, but could you just, if possible, provide some directional color surrounding cash margin expectations for offshore and international just as we perceived through the year? It has been fluctuating a bit recently.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yes, that's a tough one. We don't provide guidance beyond a quarter. I think expectations of those margins remaining where they are for the time being or for the foreseeable future is probably a fair starting point.","John Matthew Daniel - Simmons & Co. International","Okay. Thanks, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Wilson with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","David Thomas Wilson - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. John, in the past, you've mentioned a possible structural change in the industry, especially in relation to preserving the dividend at current levels. But given where we are in terms of the overall rig count being less than the number of AC rigs out there in the market, would you view this as a structural change or the present oversupply of AC rigs is just a kind of temporary phenomenon in your opinion?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't consider this as a structural change. I see it as really, a classic cyclical market at this stage. I mean, we've \u2013 if you look back in history, you can see wild \u2013 pretty wild swings and down cycles in terms of the number of rigs that are going down. You're right, there are over 900 AC rigs available today, not all AC rigs are created equal. There is \u2013 I think when you begin to see oil prices improve in the future, I don't know when that is, nobody knows, but there's going to be high demand for those assets in the future. I think the real challenge as it relates to the rig fleet, and that's the legacy fleet which we've addressed over a pretty long period of time, it's just going to be harder and harder for those rigs to be competitive. So, yeah, it's a long answer to your question. But no, I don't \u2013 we don't see this as a structural change at this point.","David Thomas Wilson - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks for that. And just as a follow-on to that, there's been a lot of talk or, I guess, I should say some talk of some significant attrition in the pressure pumping market in terms of equipment, but we really don't hear that on the land rig side in terms of true attrition from mechanical or SCR rigs. Could you share your thoughts on that as well?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think there's been a fair number of \u2013 and I don't have any recent information on this, but there's been a fair number of old rigs that have been written off consistently over the last several years. I can't speak to any recently. Juan Pablo, I don't know if you know of any, but other than that, I don't really have any to add.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","I couldn't add to that other than I certainly agree that many of our peers have decommissioned and written off a significant number of those legacy rigs. Of course, we have \u2013 we had some of that over the last few years ourselves, but it was a much smaller proportion of our fleet, of course.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","David Thomas Wilson - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll turn the call back over.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","We'll go next to Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, I wanted just to talk a little bit more about the day rates in U.S. onshore. I'm assuming the guidance reflects some mix shift benefit as more of the spot rigs are the ones idling obviously rather than contracted rigs. With the rig count taking another leg down, are you seeing \u2013 is the mentality shifting amongst your peers at all in terms of towards a utilization at any price type of mentality or do you believe that the market's level discipline is holding firm?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sean, I \u2013 this is John. I \u2013 the reality is there isn't \u2013 and it's been this way really since the downturn got into full swing \u2013 there isn't much of a spot market to speak of. And so there's not \u2013 it's not like there's a lot of competition out there for jobs, what few jobs there are out there. The customer knows what they want. They know what the market rate is. There's not a \u2013 at least from my \u2013 from our perspective, there's not a huge push on those rates at very, very low levels. I mean, obviously, there's competitors out there pricing, to a certain extent, irrationally. And maybe irrational from our perspective, but from their perspective, it may be what they need to do. But there's just not a lot of work out there being bid on. So I wouldn't, at this stage, say that anybody's strategy on pricing is going to deliver any improvement in market share at this stage of the game.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. No, I think that's very fair. So I guess if you think about \u2013 we've heard from a handful of E&Ps with updated budgets in the last couple days, so a small sample set (32:47), but the indications are for substantial capital efficiencies again after what we saw in 2015. Just curious how you see drilling efficiencies unfolding for the industry as a whole in 2016 as we continue to shrink down the level of activity.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, if you look back at least at our performance, going back to 2011, we've had double digit performance improvement in terms of footage per day. Every year since 2011, with the exception of 2013 to 2014, where 2014 activity really spiked up, it was high single digits. This year, we've got, again, high double digits improvements. But obviously, there's a point of diminishing returns on what's capable of happening out there. And so I think there'll continue to be some performance improvement year-over-year.","I would imagine a large portion of that performance improvement is going to be related to Permian, because the other basins have been drilling horizontal wells for a much longer period of time, and I would suspect that Permian is going to drive the overall industry in terms of whatever that performance improvement will be year-over-year, if that makes sense. But I don't really have a feel for \u2013 I mean, my sense is that it's not going to continue to be at high double digit type performance year-over-year.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That makes a lot of sense. And then just the last to take it to the other side. In an eventual recovery, would you expect the industry to give back then, some of those efficiencies for a period of time?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, if it's an H&P rig, I would say no. I can't really speak to anybody else. No, I think early on, I wouldn't expect that. But at least \u2013 again, I'm thinking about it from our own fleet, it's hard for me to speak for anyone else's. Clearly, with the amount of reductions, and we talked about this in our comments, not only is there a much lower level of budget, but we've had a lot of \u2013 of course, a lot of folks leave the industry. We've had a lot of reductions in that respect, and that's \u2013 that ultimately ends up being a bottleneck in a lot of cases when you begin to take the industry the other direction. So, I think that could be a challenge for the industry in general.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot, John.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Sean. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Spittel with Clarksons Platou. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey D. Spittel - Clarksons Platou Securities","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Morning.","Jeffrey D. Spittel - Clarksons Platou Securities","Maybe to follow up on Sean's question along the lines of productivity, whether it's from a per rig or per well standpoint, is it fair to say in your estimation that maybe some of those statistics as resilient as production has been have been distorted a little bit by high grading of acreage and crews and rigs? And if so, I guess is there a similar trend that you envision in terms of diminishing returns from a productivity standpoint?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't think there's any doubt that the wells that are being drilled are the best wells. I mean it would just make sense that that's what's going on. And, of course, we have \u2013 you would think everyone would have their best people, both on the operator side, on the service side, on the contractor side. I mean, it's the best of the best. So, I think all of that makes sense. And if you were to take the industry and increase the rig count by a couple hundred rigs, you'd be hard pressed to have those same efficiency levels across the industry, I would suspect.","Jeffrey D. Spittel - Clarksons Platou Securities","Sure. That makes sense. And maybe thinking at least theoretically, when things do begin to recover and customers start engaging you in a conversation about reactivations, it seems to be sort of a popular notion with some investors that it's going to be very difficult to get any sort of incremental pricing traction to reactive a rig. I'd love to hear your take on that. Obviously, it doesn't sound like there's much incremental investment necessary to bring a rig out of the yard these days. But how would you envision those conversations unfolding?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, historically, what you said is right, and I think that probably holds true going forward. I think initially, you're not going to see a pricing improvement. You're right, at least in our fleet, there shouldn't be a high level of investment in order to reactivate a rig. I think we've done a very good job in terms of idling our assets and preserving them, and there's a set of rigs that are ready to go back to work when that time would happen. And so, I think that's true. I do think there is a point in time where you begin to gain a little bit of traction because I think the rigs that are going to be desired in the industry are going to be obviously, the best rigs, and they're going to have higher horsepower. They're going to have a greater need related to, again, a third mud pump, 7,500 psi pad applications. There's going to be more investment, and that investment drives a greater level of performance. So, I think there is an opportunity to get pricing up, but it won't be at the very beginning of the cycle. I think we'll have to put some rigs back to work and improve the utilization levels of the AC fleet before you would see pricing improvements, I would suspect.","Jeffrey D. Spittel - Clarksons Platou Securities","All right. That makes sense. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, Jeff. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brad Handler with Jefferies.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Maybe I'll start with a clarification from Byron's question initially. He was asking you sort of about normalized costs, and it sounds like you said yes, but it was all contingent on the denominator. So maybe just so I understand what you're suggesting, if we think about the third fiscal quarter and if the rig count were to stay flat, is that operating cost per day of $13,600 for U.S. onshore, is that the right \u2013 is that a reasonable expectation in light of the fact that the denominator is what it is?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Brad, this is Juan Pablo. Let me give you some additional color in terms of what I was referring to. If you \u2013 anytime there is a significant transition in terms of whether it's an increase in the rig count or a decrease, there is a lot of activity that take place related to those rigs that are stacking to transport, and we need to make sure that we rig them up in the right way and prepare them to go back to work, et cetera. On the other hand, you might recall in years past, when we've had a transition from one region to another region, whether it's from \u2013 related to preference of price per oil as compared to gas and we have a lot of transition, that adds up to our cost and has typically an unfavorable impact on our average rig expense per day for the quarter. That's what we see happening in this second fiscal quarter.","Given your assumption going into the third quarter, everything else being equal, I think that there is a potential for that average to come down, but there is always other considerations to keep in mind, and we'll just have to follow that and report on that during the corresponding conference call.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Understood. And that makes sense and makes \u2013 consistent with the answer on the normalized cost being somewhat lower, so that's great. Okay, understood. Thanks.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Unrelated follow-up. So, John, in your comments, I was trying to tie your comments around what you were doing with rigs through the course of this year with some of what you wrote in your \u2013 in the narrative on the front of the press release around upgrades, continuously upgrading your best-in-class rigs. Should we think of that as being related to either adding a third mud pump or upgrading it to 7,500 psi? Is that the most important sort of change to your rigs as you think about fiscal 2016?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is a portion. There is additional horsepower requirements at times, it's a third pump at 7,500 psi. There is other upgrades, really, at this stage, we haven't talked a whole lot about and don't intend to today, but the majority on the cost side, I would say, yes, that's the portion that there was \u2013 you would see a larger CapEx exposure.","There's other things that we're working on that aren't as high on the CapEx side but deliver some value. I mean our \u2013 I mean, if you've followed us for a long time, our goal is to continuously upgrade and improve the company, not just the rigs, but the structures and processes and systems and tools that we have. So we pride ourselves in doing that and that's what we're doing. And that obviously has a price tag to it as well.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","All right. Understood. No, I was just hoping for some more color, which I think you've given, so that's helpful. That's all. I'll turn it back. Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Brad.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Brad.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Thanks, guys. A question for you on the cost side again, specifically in the U.S. How much of your reduction in operating costs so far, if any, has been related to permanent reductions in compensation for employees that remain employed? And how do you think about that concept of cutting salaries or wages going forward for people that remain employed?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The last part, I'm not certain I got all of the first part of the question, I'll turn that over to Juan Pablo. The second part of the question is, we haven't reduced wages, we hadn't increased wages since December of 2011. And wages, I think you probably know this, but just to restate, wages are typically a direct cost passed through to our customer, so there is really \u2013 there is not a savings there for us. And so at this stage, we don't have any indications that we're going to reduce our wages for our folks in the field. You have anything to add?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yes, John, and that's consistent with what I think Rob was asking related to the reductions that we've seen so far. Non-related to wages, as John mentioned, certainly, we have to deal with overages at times. And so, managing the logistics around the personnel, that's a huge challenge and we've done, as an organization, a great job so far in that regard throughout the downturn.","So, that has an impact on total expenses. But it \u2013 the reduction in expense per day has been a result, as we mentioned, of several factors within the maintenance, the efficiency with which we've been managing crews, other related costs, et cetera. I mean, I can't give you specific examples, but it's been, overall, a great effort.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","No, it is clearly, and particularly with expense per day, frac to rig this quarter being below what you posted in 2012, 2013, and 2014. I guess another way to ask the similar question would be structurally, when we go \u2013 when we end the transition process, when we end the dropping of the rigs in the market, find the \u2013 if you will find the new bottom or find a steady state level, where do you think that rig expense per day operating number is given all the moves you've made once the volatility ends?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, that's a great question. I don't have a number for you, Robert, but I can say that we are continuing to look at all the options available and understanding our costs as best as we can. And from an organizational perspective, the structure of the organization, how we can become leaner and more efficient as a company. I mean there is \u2013 all of those things are on the table and we're looking at. I think the other thing to keep in mind all during this time is the rigs have continued to work harder and harder. So the wells we're drilling today are nothing like the wells we drilled two years ago. So when you look at our cost trends over time, Juan Pablo said that our folks have done a great job. But when you consider the amount of footage that we drill in a year-to-date compared to what we did three years ago, these rigs are working so much harder, the rig move times are much less frequent, you're spending less time moving, you're spending more time drilling. So you are using expendables, as an example, much more frequently.","So the fact that we've been able to get our cost down over time is pretty amazing. So that's part of the challenges that we have as the variables are not held constant, they are continuing to change on us in an upward fashion. So we're having to work against that at the same time.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Great. Good answer. Thank you. Well, I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. A lot of questions have been answered, but a question for you, Juan Pablo, around receivables and collections. Working capital is obviously very strong in the quarter and you clearly are doing a good job on receivables. So, I'm just wondering if you can share with us a little bit, your strategy around that and how you stay close to that in keeping the DSO number so low.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Michael. Yes, we certainly pay a lot of attention to that. And in times like this, one of the variables that impacts the numbers in the balance sheet and our working capital, et cetera, relates to revenues corresponding to early termination. And so, we may be invoicing some work or early termination fees that are deferred. And so that lands in the liability side of the balance sheet, and impacts either cash or receivables, et cetera.","So we have those types of moving variables, but overall, we're very pleased with how the working capital is progressing in general, no issues to comment on around receivables, no issues to comment on about any other variables. It's great to have the very high level of liquidity that we have today. Obviously, that is partly a result of the early termination fees that we've mentioned. It is helped by the allowance for bonus depreciations that we mentioned as well. We're very pleased to be where we are from a balance sheet standpoint.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. So just so I'm clear, the number which continues to \u2013 I'm guessing is still below 80 days for the first quarter, low \u2013 I guess 73 days for the previous quarter. That's not being brought down artificially by the early terminations, is it? That's still kind of a true representation of what you're doing on a true operating basis?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","As a matter of fact, we're doing better than that. And that number in general, the days that you mentioned are skewed upward, and in both cases and throughout the last few quarters as a result of early termination. So...","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","...again, we're pleased with where we are in that regard.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Very good. Thank you for that clarification. Then, John, a question for you on overseas strategy. I know this is something that remains on the watch board, so to speak, but with so many idled assets now in the U.S., I'm wondering if there is an opportunity to make a bold move overseas and if that's something that you're seeing or would consider at this point.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Michael, we would sure consider it. Obviously, the international markets are in a bit of disarray as well, but I think we've shown in the past \u2013 the 10 rigs that we sent to Argentina, that was a result of having FlexRigs available. So, it's definitely something we have interest in. I mean, you've followed us for a long time, you know the challenges associated with growing in a significant way internationally, but obviously, we're open to having those discussions and making that happen.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So there's nothing in this downturn that makes you think that you want to be 100% U.S.? Longer term, you think having some global balances is appropriate?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we've continued to believe that international has some real upside for us. You've probably heard us say for a long time now that when unconventional resource plays become more popular, become more economic, if you will, internationally that, gosh, we ought to be in a position to take advantage of that opportunity. Obviously, the work in Argentina is really the first kind of large-scale unconventional resource play opportunity and we have more market share there than anybody else.","So I think it presents some great opportunities in the future. We've worked internationally for over 50 years. We have a lot of experience, and of course, we have a lot more we can learn. We know we can do better.","So it is a desire of the company to continue to try to grow our footprint internationally, and obviously, we have the assets and the personnel to make that happen.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","To do it. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Tom Curran with FBR Capital Markets.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Tom.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Morning, Tom.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","John or Juan Pablo, I'm sorry if I missed this, but could you give us an update on the percentage of the idle count that is equipped with a moving system, with a skidding system? And then, by the time we reach the end of this downturn, what would be your target percentage for that idle fleet?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hang on just a second, Tom, we're taking a look.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So, let's see. Of the number of idle fleet \u2013 excuse me, idle rigs that we have, and I'm taking a look at AC drive FlexRigs...","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And just in the U.S., Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. So in the U.S., it's close to 224 total AC drive FlexRigs idle. Of those, 104 rigs have pad capability. Does that address your question?","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah...","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And then I guess your \u2013 the latter part of your question is, where would we think that we would be in the future, and there's a lot of moving variables around that. As John mentioned, we continue to add pad systems to existing FlexRigs that do not have those. And so, the total number will continue to shift, the proportion will continue to grow. But not every well that is being drilled out there, as you know, of course, is on a pad or a multiple-well pad, and there is still demand for single well pad drilling. And so we'll continue to monitor that, but for the moment, we do have a significant number of rigs that are capable to address the market. Does that address your question, Tom?","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","It does, yes, and thank you for that, Juan Pablo. What would you estimate \u2013 or what have your guys estimated, industry wide, is the current total AC drive pad capable idle rig count in the U.S.?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Let me make a couple of comments, we'll take a look at that. Total number of idle AC drive rigs in the U.S., we believe, is over 500 rigs. Not sure how many of those are being actively marketed as some of those have not worked for years now, but there is a proportion of that, of course, that are pad capable. I'm not sure that I can \u2013 I'm not sure that we can pinpoint the number of rigs that do have pad capability that are idle in the entire market. I don't have that number.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think that's something that's been well advertised. I'm not certain the rig resources that we have, public rig resources, have it broken out like that.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","(57:34) I don't \u2013 yes, none of the ones I've consulted thus far have been able to nail it down, so.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","What I might add is that we do believe that there's roughly a total, not idle, but a total of 500 rigs to 600 rigs marketable AC drive rigs with pad capability \u2013 pad drilling capability.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's helpful. And even with the unknown idle rigs, given how quickly and cost effectively, how low the capital cost would be to upgrade most of those to pad capability, I'm not sure it's a distinction that even matters all that much.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Right.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","But I thought it was worth exploring. Last one for me. John, since you were Chief Operating Officer, we've talked about how over time \u2013 this is a high-level longer-term question \u2013 over time, you expect that the main advantage technologically for you to compete is shift from the rig spec gap relative to your other Tier 1 drilling competitors and move towards this unrivaled in-house database you have of more than 1,200 rig years of FlexRig experience, and combining that with the advances being made in rig computerization to sort of standardize best case performance, basin-by-basin, maybe even field-by-field. Could you just give us an update on where you think you're at with that next phase of technological differentiation?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Tom, that's a great question. There's a lot of things that we do with the data that helps us run our business better as far as maintenance and rig equipment, and that equipment running at high levels and performing well. The challenge \u2013 and we utilize that data to help the rig drill more quickly for our customers. But when you begin to \u2013 when you're working for a lot of different customers, and there's a lot of different needs and desires on how that data gets used and gets managed. So I see it as \u2013 we still see it as an opportunity. I don't have perfect clarity into how that looks going forward, but the other thing that we've said is because our fleet is all AC drive, and because our fleet is a uniform fleet and we have the ability to share that information, whatever that breakthrough may end up looking like in the future, I think we're in a better position than others in order to take advantage of that whatever that may be. There is definitely some challenges associated with it right now if you look at it across the board because of all the different folks that you're working for. Does that make sense?","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","It does. But it sounds like it would be fair to say that the vision itself is still intact and it's one you're continuing to work at in terms of realization.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I think that there's still that capability, and again, I like the fact that we have this uniform fleet and this ability to take advantage of that across our entire fleet.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Agree. I think it all \u2013 it's a clear advantage that will accrue over time. Okay, guys. Thanks. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great, Tom. Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you. And, Keith, we may have time for one more question, please.","Operator","And we can take that question from Chase Mulvehill with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you.","B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yes, sir.","B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So I guess, the first question I have is, so what is the variable cash cost per day for running an H&P rig right now?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","We don't have an exact number for you, Chase. That's a very fair question because it goes to the heart of some of the moving considerations or variables related to our total average expense per day. Some of those expenses relate to rigs that are not active, so if you were talking only about active rigs, then the number would be lower. Then if you also subtract other revenue that we \u2013 that may relate to that rig, whether it's related to H&P trucking or whether it's related to other services, whether it's rentals, et cetera, then that number continues to go down. And it also depends on the region that you are in. And the cost structure between regions, of course, as you know, is significantly different. So, I think a fair assumption is that the cash cost directly associated with the rig and without any other ancillary revenues is significantly lower than our average rig expense per day. But then, of course, you also have maintenance CapEx considerations that, of course, you probably included \u2013 including conceptually in that cash cost question, and that depends on the rig that you are looking at. If it's a new rig, your maintenance CapEx will be much lower, as you can imagine, as compared to an older rig, et cetera. So, too many moving variables to give you an answer, but I think it's a fair question and it's an important consideration in terms of pricing and competitive advantages going forward. We think we are very well positioned in that regard given the uniformity of our fleet, the way that we maintain our rigs and several other considerations.","B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And so, if I were to throw a number out there, would $10,000 a day, before we started adding maintenance CapEx or maintenance expense, sorry, to that number, would that be a ballparkish number?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Probably between that number and the total expense per day that we report on without maintenance CapEx. Then if you have maintenance CapEx, then the number goes on top of that. But again, it probably might be a little misleading to use a round number like that and suggest that, that applies across the board, so I'm hesitant in giving you a firm answer on that.","B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. Right. Understood. And then, upgrade CapEx through the downturn, how should we think about that? 2016 is going to be a rough year, but if we get a recovery in 2017 and it continues into 2018, what kind of upgrade CapEx should we expect for H&P?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Well, our maintenance CapEx, of course, it is much lower with the reduced level of activity you were referring to, not only maintenance, I think you're referring to what \u2013 if you continue to add certain types of capabilities to rigs that don't have it, like pad systems or 7,500 psi system, et cetera, how much would that take on an annual basis going forward. And the answer is, unfortunately, also inconclusive, it depends. We would have to take a look at what the market demand is and what the shape of the recovery is, et cetera. I'm not sure if I can add much more clarity than that. It's a fair question, Chase, but very difficult to point to a number at this point.","B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. All right. Yeah, I just get the question all the time between what's your maintenance CapEx in a recovery scenario and what kind of upgrade CapEx should I add in there. So I thought I'd try to get some color there. And last one and then I'll turn it over. Thoughts on building on spec during an upturn. 2017, 2018, if the rig count's up 30% a year, your rig count gets 200 rigs or above, and do you consider building your own spec if the recovery is intense enough?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Chase, this is John. Gosh, I wish we had that problem to worry about then, that sounds like a great situation.","B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a tough one to call right now, I mean, when you consider the number of rigs that we have idled, not only us, but the overall industry. Obviously, we've seen it before, we've seen this market turn very quickly and it could get there. We've obviously built new rigs on spec before, you know what our preference has been. So, I mean, it \u2013 we would be foolish to say, hey, we're going to completely rule it out. There's a lot of different considerations you'd have to take into account. But at this stage, I think anything would be on the table. If there is a market there for that type of opportunity, nobody can respond more quickly than H&P, nobody has the ability to build a quality AC rig at the cost that we're able to do it. So it's a great opportunity for us. Again, I look forward to having that opportunity.","B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Well, our fingers are crossed, so...","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right.","B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right. John, Juan Pablo, appreciate it. Thank you, all.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Thank you, Chase. Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And, Keith, we will have a couple of additional comments to make if I may hand it over to John, please.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I just want to thank all of you again for joining us this morning. I'm just going to make a couple of more just brief comments before we sign off. You've heard Juan Pablo and I described that this remains a very challenging environment, but we do believe the company is very well positioned.","Our long term contracts continue to protect our investments and overall, our customer base remains resilient.

You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I'll now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone and thank you again for joining us on the call.","We're pleased with the improving outlook in the U.S. land market. The downturn has been a challenging two-year journey and H&P has been preparing for the opportunity this upturn presents. The company has seen significant increases in rig activity levels and market share over the last few months. I believe our people have responded in a remarkable fashion both in terms of the number of rigs activated and the value provided to customers and ultimately to shareholders.","There are three main areas I'd like to turn your attention to this morning; first is the success we've had in reactivating FlexRigs. Our customers have added FlexRigs in all of the U.S. basins in which we work.","Second, I will provide an update to our FlexRigs super-spec upgrade program and our progress in providing the right rig for our customer drilling program.","Finally I'll discuss a timely CapEx increase which aligns with our outlook for the next two quarters and supports our ability to continue to build market share. First let's discuss our success in reactivating FlexRigs.","Since the last earnings call on November 17 of '16 we have put 36 FlexRigs to work which is the equivalent to delivering a FlexRigs to active status every 47 hours. Of those rigs, 21 are in the spot market and 15 on term contract. Although spot pricing remains low, we are seeing some pricing improvements for high quality high performing AC drive rigs.","The Permian led the way with 12 rigs, six each and the Eagle Ford and SCOOP and STACK play we had three in the Haynesville, two each in the Marcellus, Utica and Piceance basins and one a piece in the Niobrara, Woodbine and Texas Gulf Coast.","From a FlexRig model perspective, 23 out of 36 were FlexRig 3s, two were FlexRig 4s, and 11 were FlexRig 5s. As we commented on the last call, we continue to have great demand for the FlexRig 3. It is workhorse of the fleet and delivers great value for the customer on single well and pad locations.","Of these 36 rigs approximately two-third were classified as super-spec. We have also added 11 new customers since the last call and momentum has been building as a result of the performance our folks are delivering. Even with the high delivery cadence, we have maintained problem free startups. This means safe, efficient and reliable performance right out of the gate. And this is being rewarded as evidenced by the continued demand we are seeing from customers today for rig deliveries at least through the remainder of our second fiscal quarter of 2017.","Our two most active basins today are the Permian and the SCOOP and STACK play. The Permian remains our most active operation and we have 60 rigs contracted coming off a low of 38 contracted rigs and at one point last summer we only had about 23 operating rigs. We have 62 idle FlexRigs in the area, 42 of which are 1500 horsepower and we expect to continue to have opportunities to grow our active fleet in the Permian. In the SCOOP and STACK today we have 27 rigs contracted coming off a low of 15 contracted rigs.","We estimate that H&P has about 56% of the available 1500 horsepower AC rigs in U.S. land today providing more capacity than any of our competitors in the market. We currently have 139, 1500 horsepower AC FlexRigs under contract and 187 idle and available to go to work in the U.S. We have 20% market share of the U.S. land horizontal and directional drilling market with our closest competitor at 12%. We believe that our overall market share in US land has expanded to approximately 18% from 16% over the past few months.","And we've been able to grow our market share from 15% since the peak of activity in 2014. Since the trough of the downturn in May of last year, we have more than doubled our number of active rigs to the current level that's close to 140 rigs. Putting that many rigs back to work successfully as a complex effort and involve many constituents. A significant element in our success is our workforce staffing effort. That team is been responsible for hiring previous employees for our reactivated rigs. We rehired over 1500 former field employees since May of last year and it shows in the morale of our people across the Board.","Another group that contributed significantly is our customer account managers and contract management teams with the volume of rig activations they have all contributed to growing our business and expanding our customer base and market share. Those efforts have enabled adding 24 first time FlexRig users since the bottom of the cycle in May of last year. We want to thank everyone as a company for working together as a team to achieve these milestones.","The second area I wanted to focus on is our ongoing effort to provide the right rig in our family of solutions for our customers. Our FlexRig design allows H&P to invest in our existing fleet to enhance rig capabilities that will benefit our customers in the areas that require well designs, which are more challenging and complex.","H&P leads the industry with our fleet of AC drive super-spec rigs that have 7500 PSI circulating systems, multi-well pad capability, 1,500 horsepower draw-works rating and 750,000 pounds load.","On our last call, we mentioned having approximately 80 of these rigs and as of today, we have approximately 100 super-spec rigs in the fleet. The industry's capacity to provide additional super-spec rigs in a timely and cost effective way appears to be limited today, with the existing industry rig fleet, which positions H&P very well for future expansion in this space.","Should there be significant market demand for super-spec rigs going forward, H&P has the capability of providing approximately 270 super-spec FlexRigs to the market without requiring any new builds. Solely through upgrades where needed to our current FlexRigs 3 and FlexRigs 5 fleet.","Our uniform base of existing FlexRigs leveraged by our experience and design and construction, enables us to invest in our fleet for the future in a scalable and cost-effective way.","Finally, the last area I want to address before turning the call to Juan Pablo, is an increase in our CapEx which is driven by the improving market conditions and customer demand. Juan Pablo will go into more details in his remarks, but I want to underscore a few important points.","A portion of this increase will be dedicated to super-spec upgrades to our FlexRigs fleet, which will enable us to continue to be able to respond quickly to customers in this tightening market. There are a couple of important factors driving this. First, as a result of the high demand for FlexRigs, we have contract commitments for a large portion of our super-spec capability and we want to make certain future deliveries are constrained.","The upgrades include some of our standard super-spec features, the 7500 PSI circulating systems, third mud pump, control and data system enhancements, setback capacity and Flex3 pad capability. We continue to have incremental demand from customers for additional Flex3 skid systems. So we plan to increase our capacity to meet the significant demand from customers.","Second we will be adding our first prototype walking system to an existing FlexRigs3. When this Flex3 with a walking system is complete, it will also have all of the standard super-spec upgrades similar to our super-spec capacity Flex3 and Flex5s that we have in the market today.","We expect the first rig to be delivered in the current quarter and if there's demand from customers, we would plan to deliver a few more Flex3s with walking systems in 2017. These CapEx increases in upgrades to our fleet are examples of having great flexibility to invest in our uniform fleet of FlexRigs providing the right rig to meet customer needs and adding value to shareholders.","And now I'll turn the call to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $35 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Nevertheless, as John described, the ongoing U.S. land drilling market recovery has been providing exciting opportunities for the company to redeploy a large number of FlexRigs into the market.","Following are some details on each of our three drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling segment reported an operating loss of approximately $31 million during the first fiscal quarter. However, the number of revenue days increased by approximately 23% compared to the prior quarter resulting in an average of close to 106 rigs generating revenue days during the first fiscal quarter.","On average approximately 73 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 33 rigs worked in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 2% to $23,891 in the first fiscal quarter as a proportion of rigs working in the spot market increase significantly quarter to quarter.","Excluding lawsuit settlement charges and adjustments to self insurance reserves, the average rig expense per day increased by about 13% to $15,064. A significant sequential increase in this average was expected as a result of a much lower proportion of rigs generating revenue days while on standby. The increase in the average however was further amplified by a larger than expected number of rigs that return to work during the last few months generating additional upfront startup expenses that were sold during the first fiscal quarter.","To provide them conflict, a number of rigs generating revenue days increased from 102 to 138 since our last conference call in mid-November. As a result of these changes in daily revenue and expenses, the corresponding average of rig margin per day during the first fiscal quarter was $8,827.","The segment generated approximately $9 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the first fiscal quarter. No early termination notices for rig in the U.S. land segment have been received or announced since last July but given prior notifications we expect to generate approximately $6 million during the second fiscal quarter and a total of over 25 million during several quarters thereafter in early termination revenues.","Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contract and the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are estimated at over $460 million.","As of today our 350 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 140 rigs generating revenue and 210 idle rigs. Included in the 140 rigs generating revenue are 89 rigs under term contracts, 87 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 51 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 138 rigs generating revenue days in the second.","Three, of the 138 rigs remain idle and on standby type day rates. Apparently those two rigs that are not generating revenue days include new build rigs that are waiting for the customer to be ready for delivery.","Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect a sequential increase and activity in the range of 30% to 35% in terms of revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $22,400 primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market.","Although spot pricing remains low, we expect to see average spot pricing for FlexRigs improve over the next few months as we are now seeing leading-edge day rates moving from the mid-teen to the high teens.","The average rig expense per day level is expected to decrease to roughly $14,900. Although we expect this average expense level to eventually come down to more normalized level, the upfront rig startup expenses during this phase of the up-turn along with the caring cost is still over 200 idle and available AC drive FlexRigs are temporarily and unfavorably impacting the average.","If we isolate rigs that remained active during the first fiscal quarter, their average expense level was still close to $13,000 per rig per day which is similar to overall levels experienced in more stable time period like 2013 and 2014.","The segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 86 rigs during the second fiscal quarter, 75 rigs during the remaining two quarters of fiscal 2017, 44 rigs during fiscal 2018 and 17 rigs during fiscal 2019.","These commitments include about 20 rigs that have been placed under term contract since last May with a pricing at slightly higher than spot market levels. Including these newly contracted rigs, the average daily rig margin for rigs that are under term contract has been declining from a $15,000 to $16,000 range to an expected range between $13,000 and $14,000 per day during the second fiscal quarter.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $7 million. Total revenue days remained flat and the average rig margin per day increased by about 16% during the first fiscal quarter to $10,478 per day, excluding self-insurance reserve adjustments during the prior quarter.","As we look at the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect quarterly revenue days to decline by approximately 10% as one of the seven offshore platform rigs that were generating revenue days during the prior quarter is expected to be released by the operator during the second fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $12,000 per day during the second fiscal quarter at five of the six rigs that are expected to continue to generate revenue days at the end of the quarter, will soon be working under operating day rates, while the remaining one rig is expected to continue under a standby-type bid rate.","The management contracts on platform rigs contributed approximately $4 million to our offshore segment operating income during the quarter and are expected to generate around $3 million in operating income during each of the next two quarters.","Moving on to our international land operations, this segment reported operating income of approximately $1 million during the first fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact from early contract termination revenue of approximately $5 million, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by approximately 16% to $8,883 per day.","Revenue days also declined by approximately 16%, primarily as a result of an early termination notice related to five of our rigs under long-term contract in the segment. We expect early termination fees related to the notification to favorably impact our operating income in the near future.","As a result of the recent early termination notice, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decrease by approximately 38% during the second fiscal quarter. As of today, our international land segment has eight of the 38 rigs in this segment, generating revenue days, including five in Argentina, two in Columbia and one in Bahrain.","Seven of these rigs are under long-term contracts and two of the seven are scheduled to roll off their term contract during this fiscal year. Excluding the impact of early termination revenue, the average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to approximately $5,000 per day, primarily as a result of a higher overhead expense per revenue day given the very low utilization rate in the segment.","We will continue to manage overhead expenses while at the same time, remain mindful of the potential recovery in international markets, which may simply be lagging the recovery that we are now experiencing in the U.S. land market.","When we combine all three of our drilling segments and exclude rigs with early termination, we currently have an average of approximately 86 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017, 51 in fiscal 2018 and 22 in fiscal 2019.","Let me now comment on corporate level of detail. As a result of improved market conditions in the U.S. land market, our fiscal 2017 CapEx is now estimated to be around $350 million, about 30% of which is expected to be related to maintenance CapEx and tubulars and the remainder mostly to upgrades of our existing fleet.","Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to be in great position to sustain regular dividend levels along with ample flexibility to take advantage of opportunities going forward. The effective income tax rate on the loss for the first fiscal quarter was approximately 35%. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 is at this point expected to be around 33% which is a reduction from our prior estimate of 36% due primarily to considerations related to foreign jurisdiction or tax benefit or operating losses are uncertain.","With that, let me turn the call back to John.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo.","Before we open the call for questions, I want to reiterate a few points. There is optimism in the marketplace post OPEC meeting with stronger oil prices and an improving outlook we will continue to reactivate idle rigs out of our facilities safely, efficiently and cost-effectively. It is gratifying to see that many of the strategies we employ to prepare for this eventual increase in Japan are bearing fruit as we redeploy rigs to the field. Our fleet is particularly well-suited for the more technically challenging wells being drilled today. I think more importantly we have the people, the systems and the operational support structures in place to drive the highest levels of performance and reliability for our customers.","And Savana we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, guys. So John could you give us a little bit more color on your pricing commentary and maybe some thoughts about the pace of pricing as we go into 2017 and really good potentially in the year. And then second on the pricing side, do you expect it to remain very narrowly focused on the super-spec rigs or could it start the spread to other rig type?","John Lindsay","Okay. Angie, what oil price are we going to have?","Angie Sedita","That's too much where it is today, it\u2019s flat.","John Lindsay","Okay. I think there's no doubt that we have some pricing power in the market now. I mean obviously we've all - I think everyone has been pleasantly surprised with how quickly things have moved and so it's been - it's been kind of hard to keep up with it quite frankly but there is pricing power - you know as well as I do it's pretty hard to see out past El Paso this quarter. We obviously have a lot of calls coming in and customers wanting rigs and - for February, March even some April deliveries.","And so with that we would expect to see some continued pricing. I think the question if oil prices remain in this - in this range if you look at the rigs, they're very, very low rig count environment we had over the last year or previous this uptick has been a function of just really, really low oil prices obviously and customer spending with a cash flow.","So with these new levels, the question is how many rigs does it take I think right now, it appears that we're on target as industry to potentially get to \u2013 we're almost at 700 so you would think that 800 is within our sides.","And so I think again in that case it\u2019s going to be tied and I think to your question on super-spec I do think that there is going to be pricing power on super-spec as you heard - we've even put a couple of Flex4s to work but I think clearly the majority of the focus is going to be on the higher end, higher spec rigs based on the types of wells that we see customers drilling today.","Angie Sedita","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, as a follow-up - just quickly on 800 rigs in our sites does that for 2017, the 800 could be in our side. And then second, in your prepared remarks you made comments on the industry's ability to upgrade the super-spec as being limited and maybe you can give us little more color there.","John Lindsay","Well, on the limited, I think if you look at the inventory of rigs that are capable of being upgraded to how we define super-spec, there's only what they were still around 300, around 300 rigs and the majority half of that is, over half of that is H&P and then the other is made up of two or three maybe four contractors for the most part.","So it's a pretty small group of players that have access at least what we think are the rigs that are going to be in the highest demand. So I think that's the part of the scarcity if you will even though obviously the rigs are there and they can't be upgraded.","The 800 is really just looking at our rig count and understanding where we think we're going based on the commitments that we've had and maintaining an 18% to 20% market share and so that's kind of how we get to the 800 and again it's a function of what oil prices do and how the outlook is but right now it sure seems like there continues to be demand for those types of rigs.","Angie Sedita","All right. Thanks for the color and I'll turn it over.","John Lindsay","All right. Angie thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from John Daniel with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Daniel","Guys, just two questions for me, on international, can you speak to any visibility that you might have for rig reactivations as you roll through the year?","John Lindsay","John, we really don't have any positive outlook in that respect. I think you've heard several people say that and we've known this for several months that while we hit the bottom in U.S. land last summer, it may be this summer before we completely hit bottom in international. So we don't really have any insight. We have had a few bids that we participated in, but I don't know of anything that's coming out of that.","John Daniel","Okay. And then just appreciating the fact that you guys don't like to give guidance beyond the current quarter, but with what you know in terms of relative stability at this point on activity I am assuming and knowing that you're burdened with some overhead cost, is the cash margin guidance for current fiscal quarter is that representative of range at least as we go through the rest of this year barring a pickup in activity?","Juan Pablo Tardio","John this is Juan Pablo. I think that's the best guess that we would have at this point, but certainly many factors could influence that going forward and we'll try to keep folks informed us of any development there, but at this point it's just a starting point.","John Daniel","Okay. And then just the last one for me is on the walking system you put in, can you just provide some color? I'm assuming that XY capability and was this at the request of the customer or what prompted the initiative here to make the investment?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Well John it really hasn't been at the request of a customer. Obviously, there has been a lot of focus on the walking systems going back at least two years maybe even three years and we've commented several times that we have the capability to do it if it's something that we see the potential for growth and it's a prototype and we think that -- we think it will be a good rig, think it will be again another nice option to be able to provide to customers if the demand is there and I think that's really the question is what kind demand we're going to see out of it?","Obviously at this stage I can say that the prototype and we have -- we do have a job for the first rig. We're not building at own spec, but if we see some demand, we'll build some additional. Again from our perspective, we talked about in our prepared remarks that in addition to that, we're also having high demand for Flex3s skid systems and I can tell you three or six months whether never guess that we would be getting to the end of our availability on our Flex3 skid system. So customers like the Flex3 skid system, the walking application obviously I think by definition is a bidirectional, omni-directional and so I think it'll be a good, a good addition as a fleet.","John Daniel ","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Robin Shoemaker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robin Shoemaker","Okay, thank you. So John I wanted to just ask you about term contracts. You mentioned you have signed a good number here as your rigs have gone back to work. So how should we think about a term contract today compared to where we were in a couple of years ago when you were signing two, three year contracts obviously is different but could you speak to the duration and in some way to the premium that you would expect over spot to - for signing a term contract today.","John Lindsay","Yes Robin just in general, I mean obviously the term contracts are much different than what we entered into previously obviously back then we were building new rigs and we were getting great returns in three-year term contracts. This is really more about the customer I think in a few cases it's \u2013 we're getting \u2013 kind of ensuring we're getting a payback on some investments that we're making in rigs but more than anything it's focused \u2013 it's more focused on the customer and in particular areas.","I think the average term is little over a year, it's not like we're locking into a long period of time. There is a premium you know it's it ranges up thousand dollars a day range but if that\u2019s about all that we will really talk about that you have too many other questions other than that. Again it's a relatively small number if you look at it in context of what we've entered into with the overall working fleet and the capacity of additional rigs coming on. Again things have moved very, very quickly.","Robin Shoemaker","Okay, thanks. And so then on the - as they have moved quickly, what's happening in terms - could you describe your hiring initiatives. I know you had a policy or strategy of keeping your most experienced people during the downturn in and having them work at lower level positions. So as these rigs go back is that all working according to plan and do you see any possibility for upward pressure on wages in this very active period of hiring that you're going through?","John Lindsay","Yes, that's a great question and it has worked out very much like we had planned. In my prepared remarks our folks have just done a great job. Our workforce staffing group has done excellent, they\u2019re working overtime in bringing the existing or previous employees back on and also obviously beginning to hire some new employees so there's a lot of interviewing going on, a lot of process is there happening.","We've been very, very pleased with it and I think we had a little over 80% of acceptance rate and very little turnover in the previous employees that we brought on. The ability to move people that have been bought back in position from floorhand to driller, driller to rig manager, rig manager to superintendent as you can imagine has a huge impact - positive impact on morale, everybody is excited about it including everybody here in Tulsa, it's been found to see and it's good to see rigs going back to work.","So that part of it has worked out very well. Obviously there's a lot of demand for people. I'd like to think that H&P is in a great position. We've not had issues hiring in the past. I don't expect we'll have issues hiring today. We haven't had any increases in wages but I mean that's always something that we keep our eye on just make certain that we\u2019re paying our folks competitively.","We did not have wage reduction during the downturn. So obviously our employees are moving back up into their previous position after being bumped back are in fact getting a raise. They are getting an increase from what they have compensated. So that's obviously adding to the optimism of our folks.","Robin Shoemaker","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Waqar Syed","Thank you for taking my question. John when do you expect your OpEx in the US land to get back into that low 13,.000 kind of range?","John Lindsay","Well Waqar that's a test, again I think go back to Juan Pablo's remarks, the rigs that are working obviously are working at that level. It's the impact of having as many rigs coming on as what we've had. That's a tough one to call. If you could tell me again how many more rigs we're going to put out next quarter and the quarter after that, we could probably begin to give you an estimate of that.","But I think everyone and I know everyone around this table is surprised that how quickly things move and including 36 rigs back to work in less than 70 days is quite a number of rigs. So I really can't answer the question. Obviously we're focused on it. I think we're in a position to get it back down into that 13 range.","I think the thing to keep in mind though too Waqar is that and I've said this before, I think you get lost on people because that's really experienced it but these rigs are working harder. Not only are we drilling wells faster, we're moving rigs more often. Tough pressures are higher expendables on 7500 PSI systems are more costly than 5,000 PSI obviously.","And so for us to be able to keep our cost in the range that we have over time is really pretty impressive. So we have in fact lower cost from that perspective, but again it's a tough one to call. Juan Pablo do you have anything to add.","Waqar Syed","So let's say if the pace slows down to maybe picking up five to 10 rigs a quarter rather than like 30-plus would be get back to that level with that pace? Would we be able to absorb most of the incremental cost you get into that 13.5 kind of range?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Waqar this is Juan Pablo. I think that's a fair assumption of what happens also is that the activity continues to go up, the denominator grows and is able to absorb much of that. So there's a few moving pieces to that, but I think your comment is fair.","John Lindsay","Waqar if you look back 2009 2010, it's very similar, the only difference then is we didn't have near as many idle rigs, but we didn't have near as larger fleet and on a percentage basis, we didn't nearly idle as many rigs. So you have to take that into account but clearly we got our cost back in line pretty quickly back then and I expect we'll do the same thing here.","Waqar Syed","No, in terms of tubulars and good pipe, do you have an inventory of 5.5 inch drill pipe? How much of, one of the customers requesting these days, do you hit a lot of phone customers with respect to using these bigger drill pipes and then if the need, if there is demand for that, would you be buying that? Would you be renting it?","John Lindsay","We just 5.5 inch drill pipe for many, many years primarily offshore and in some international locations, we do have 5.5 inch drill pipe in the fleet. We have purchased some 5.5 over the last year. It's not a large inventory. There's not what I would consider a huge demand pool for 5.5. Most of its five inch pipe and there are still some customers that have been 4.5, but I think for the most part five inch is in demand.","I think if 5.5 goes into demand and again we'll have to begin to order that and see what the supply chain looks like. I'm not really familiar with what the supply chain looks in that respect.","Waqar Syed","Would you have to make any changes to your top drives if the trend moves towards that or do you think your drives can handle that?","John Lindsay","Yes. We've had I don't know how many strengths we have out running right now with 5.5 either, 5.5 we own or 5.5 with the customers who entered. And know there's no upgrade - typically the upgrade that needs to be accomplished and it has to do with the wracking board on the mast but that's very small, very low-cost but we have plenty of horsepower capability and tour capability with the top graph we have.","Waqar Syed","And then second on international market these early terminations, could you tell us what was the rational for the customer or they reducing activity or they want to take advantage of the spot markets, are there some labor issues. Why do you think the customers terminated the contracts?","Juan Pablo Tardio ","Well Waqar I can't speak to all the details. My suspicion is it has to do with the just international and general continuing to contract in activity. That's really I think what it's about I don't know of any other details associated with the other things that you mentioned.","Waqar Syed","Okay. And then just one final question for the second half of fiscal year 2017, did you mention $25 million in early termination revenues for U.S. land, is that right?","Juan Pablo Tardio ","Can you repeat your question Waqar I missed the first part.","Waqar Syed","Yes, for the second half of '17 - fiscal year '17, did you mention that early termination revenues in the U.S. land could be $25 million or did I didn\u2019t hear it correctly?","Juan Pablo Tardio","I think the assumption is in general correct but it goes beyond 2017. So we provided some reference for the second fiscal quarter and then after that meaning the second half of fiscal '17 and probably also continuing into 2018 we have a total of $25 million that would be distributed during the next following quarters.","Waqar Syed","Okay. During the next, you said what how many quarters?","Juan Pablo Tardio","I can't provide the exact details but several quarters.","John Lindsay","Hi Waqar back on your question on international, our five rigs are not the only rigs that are \u2013 I mean it's an industry issue, it's not focused on individual rig types or performance anything related to that, it's just a general this part of the downturn in lower commodity prices.","Waqar Syed","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Timna Tanners of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Timna Tanners","Hi, good morning guys. I get a lot of questions and I talk to investors about your dividend policy, so I just wanted to clarify, you do like CapEx obviously going up, perhaps some restocking needs. If in a given year you has cash generation later than your dividend payout, does that effectively look at the dividends or are you looking more on a long term basis of your normalized cash flow. Thanks.","John Lindsay","We\u2019ll look at it on a long-term basis. At this point for the foreseeable future the expectation is that, we will sustain the dividends level, we see no reason to change that at this point. There is many moving variables that impact the company's liquidity but our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong and so that provides opportunities not only to continue to return cash to shareholders through the regular dividends but also to take advantage of any opportunities that make come our way.","Timna Tanners","Good, I wanted that clarification that\u2019s really helpful. And another question I had was related to some of the feedback you get from your customers. In particular I was wondering if you could comment on the sensitivity to price and how that's changed perhaps or how you see that.","And then also any observation that they may have on some rig ops lessons that could help on tamper the oversupply that we still see in the market? Thanks.","John Lindsay","Timna, were you saying price as in day rate is that what you\u2019re referencing?","Timna Tanners","Absolutely, so the concern being that as \u2013 as we start to back to some pricing power, what kind of perspective you expect to get, are they prepared to pay upward. So just general comments about how they are viewing their requirements and paying per services so that\u2019s been kind of the mix bag from what we hear?","John Lindsay","Right. I think it\u2019s pretty straight-forward that cost of the rig is really small component of these total well cost. However it is a substantial impact on total well cost because of well cycle times.","I don't get the impression that there's going to be a massive amount of pushback. The reality is we have many, many rigs that have continued to work on term contracts mid-20s high-20s type rates and they don't have any negative impact on total cost of a customer's well and in fact we don't hear anything about that.","So clearly no one wants to pay any more than they have to, but I think in a tightening environment and an environment where contractors are needing to invest and the performance of their I think customers are going to be more than willing to pay.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Thank you.","John Lindsay","And Timna, I think you had another question related to rig obsolescence. Was your question related to the industry in general or are you asking about H&P?","Timna Tanners","No, I was asking more about the industry in general because that's a scene that we also hear is to the extent that the oversupply that was daunted by perhaps in the industry is less than people believe because many of these rigs will never be, just wondering what you're hearing on that topic lately?","John Lindsay","Yeah, I think that's a great point. If you go back to the peak in 2014 and there were over 1800 rigs running and about 900 or less probably 850 at that time were AC drive rigs and so that means the rest of the fleet was made up of legacy rigs, mechanical and SCR.","And you can see today, I don't have it in front of me but I think mechanical rigs are what less than 20%, 16% and SCR rigs are 18% and AC drive rigs continue to capture market share at the peak in 14. AC rigs made up 41% of share today. AC rigs make up 66% and growing. And so yeah, I think there's definitely an obsolescence factor.","Those rigs are designed why those rigs are 50 years old. A lot of those rigs were built in the 70s and 80s and it's going to be really challenging for those rigs to keep up particularly if you're looking to put a rig like that on these longer lateral wells and drill the wells in the times that we're drilling them today with FlexRigs that are just going to have a tough time competing.","Timna Tanners","Thank you, again.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Johnston of Instinet. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matthew Johnston","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to hone in on some of the moving pieces around OpEx for the reactivated rigs in the U.S. land business, is that mostly labor, is it all labor that you're incurring upfront or are there any equipment upgrades that are being expensed in the P&L?","And then you slightly connected to that, if we could get an update on what CapEx per rig looks like for the reactivated rigs that would be helpful?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Matthew, this is Juan Pablo. As it relates to the OpEx, the start-up expenses, most of that is related to supplies and maintenance and so that is absorbed as an expenditure, anything that may be a capital investment of course is captured in our CapEx. So there are labor components as well, but they're not as significant as what I would refer to as M&S or maintenance or supply.","On the CapEx level, per rig dollars in terms of upgrades etcetera that's a difficult one to answer because there are difficult types of, excuse me, there are different types of upgrades that are being performed on each rig in particular. So there is a wide range and in some cases there are several upgrades related to rig and some other cases there are just one piece that needs to be updated or refurbished and so it's a wide range.","The other piece that is important to note that the upgrade CapEx is not only related to rigs that are currently not working and that are being upgraded to go back to work. It also relates to many of the rigs that are active and that are upgraded in many cases during a rig move or at some point during the operation.","So lots of variables to consider there. No clean answer to the question.","Matthew Johnston","Okay. Fair enough. And then just going back to the walking system prototype, for the Flex3, curious if you could provide some details on what the capital cost might look like for that endeavor?","John Lindsay","Well Matthew we're at this stage with it being a prototype and it not being out we're not going to comment. We don't know the exact number. We do know that it's going to be a higher total investment than that an upgrade of a Flex3 with the skid system.","But we will talk about that more in the future but I think at this stage of the game, it's best not to comment on any further. Again it's not only are we adding a walking system, but we're also doing all of the other upgrades to get the rig to a super-spec. So again, I don't have the total cost in front of me, but we will talk about it in the future.","Matthew Johnston","Got it. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sean Meakim","Hi guys. Thanks. So just one of it may be summarize a little bit of what we heard a couple different comments during the call, does it at times ramp faster than I think a lot of people were expecting through the holidays now start the year, you guys are clearly taking some market share.","Your guidance for the quarter seems to imply pretty big deceleration in rig ads in February-March versus December and January and so I am just curious if your perception is that you don't just pulled forward their rig addition and at that pace is it going to slow pretty dramatically. Does it get closer to the mid year or do you have sufficient line suffice to say that, so we can continue the pretty healthy pace towards that 800 number that you mentioned earlier?","John Lindsay","Well Sean based on what we think we'll go to work with our fleet that's how we get to the 800, if so and that's assuming we maintain similar market share. Again as I said earlier, it's very hard to see past the next couple of months and so clearly it could be that a 720 between a 700 and an 800 rig count is the rig count that is needed with the cash flow is going to be generated at those prices at the current oil prices and so that's the part that's kind of hard for us to see.","We are preparing ourselves for a continued improvement in rig activity. We think we're prepared to do that, but obviously not clear if that's where the direction of the industry continues to go based on what we know. I think further what we've seen is if you look back to 2009, 2010, the industry put 700 rigs back to work in 12 months.","I think if you look at the last six months here, I think we're kind of on a track for maybe 450 to 500 rigs. I think I've got that right. So we're just kind of making an educated guess at this stage but I think it's hard to see past the current quarter and so that's the reason why our numbers are presented the way they are.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Okay. That's fair enough. Thank you. And then just one last quick one. Coming out of a downturn, it seems like there is a significant shift in demand towards some of the premium drilling services, wearable has got a lot of attention moving away from some of the more conventional equipment.","Are you seeing that on your rigs and over time could a trend like that influence the types of services that you want to be participating with respect to bundling that into your joint offering?","John Lindsay","I haven't heard specifically on our rigs that Rotary steerable are increasing and we've had Rotary steerable on our rigs running pretty consistently over the last several years. I have not heard that the trend is increasing although I wouldn't be surprised to see that. As you know we have our own Rotary steerable tool.","It's been very challenging to get traction bundling that with our services and offering it to customers, but I think in general, I wouldn't be surprised to Rotary excludable continuing to gain traction.","At the same time, directional drillers with conventional downhole tools continue to get better and so and I obviously, the cost differential and sometimes there is an uptime or downtime differential with the Rotary with the higher technology tools.","So obviously as the technology get better, the uptime gets better than I think you'll probably see additional traction, but again I apologize, I haven't seen that. So I don't know the details.","Sean Meakim","That's very helpful feedback. Thanks John.","John Lindsay","All right Sean. Thank you.","David Hardie","Savanna, we probably have time for one last question.","Operator","All right. We'll take our last question from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brad Handler","Thanks for squeezing me in. Hi guys.","John Lindsay","Good morning, Brad.","Brad Handler","Maybe a couple of observations on my part and maybe I apologize a little in advance if it seems a little rhetorical, but I am really asking for your color and thoughts about it. The first is when you were idling rigs there we had a conversation we all had a conversation around putting money into them to prepare them to come out more easily or quickly presumably and less expensively.","I guess in light of that is difficult for us to know how much of that you're seeing as you bring rigs back out, but are you comfortable that that still helped? Are you spending a lot less money now despite the OpEx numbers we see rising?","John Lindsay","Right, I think that's a great observation and a good question and I've asked a lot of folks around here and we have -- obviously there's data and there's things you can measure and then there's also some of the intangibles and listen I said in our first rodeo, we've gone through this before. We know what it felt like in '09 and '10 with far fewer FlexRigs and so it definitely has been an advantage for us.","No way we would have been able to responded in the same fashion that we responded up to this point in terms of just sheer numbers of rigs. We've also had maintenance CapEx savings, the savings really go on and on. I think it would be great to have a summary which will be there one of these days where we can look back on it and say you know what, this is the value add ultimately that we had again.","There is going to be something that are going to be intangible. It's kind of hard to measure the satisfaction of a customer when the rig comes out of the stack yard and moves in two days and drills the record well first rattle out the box and that just didn't happen back in '09 and '10.","So I feel good about it that we've made a wise choice and again it was back to claiming more later and I think it's paying off for us. Anything Juan Pablo you want to add?","Juan Pablo Tardio","I think that covers it well. Thank you.","Brad Handler","All right. Great. I really -- I do appreciate that a few that come out and I guess the second question is from a market share perspective, it's been interesting to watch because in the first few months of the recovery, you probably lost a little bit of share that you would gain through the course of time in the downturn.","And then it seems like over the last few months, you've gotten a ton of it back and there was a period of time when you were and I know you were speaking in the beginning of December your Flex3 utilization was quite low even with skating systems that was down at 50% relative to Flex5 and the like and now Flex3s are coming back.","And so I guess I am curious is this just a natural function of given where rates are, customers are going to use them or just going to grab the most capable rig even if they don't need it and then you drift into the next layer, which is the Flex3 system. Is that how you might characterize that lag and then catch up period from a market share perspective.","John Lindsay","Well if you recall Brad, early in the cycle, we knew that back in November that the November -- October that the trough was May and things were improving, but if you recall the first operators that begin to put rigs to work were not really the traditionally H&P type customers.","And so we were a little slow to respond and a lot of the wells quite frankly were not more challenging horizontal directional wells a lot of it was vertical work. And so I think that\u2019s part of it.","I think the other part we've tried to speak, it's hard to do it and it comes back to that intangible that I mentioned earlier. If you're a drilling manager or a drilling superintendent working for an operator then you are going to go out and contract a rig, the last thing you want to do is go contract one that\u2019s going to show up on the first location and take 10 days to rig up and then have all kinds of downtime, not have the right people, not have the type of performance that you want.","And so being able to do that time and time again for customers obviously improve the relationship and additional work with that customer but it also attracts other customers. Again we have 24 new customers since the trough that we picked up and a lot of those are picking FlexRigs because they've seen the performance that we've had in the field.","So I think that's really what it is, whether it\u2019s a Flex3 or whether it's a Flex5 and I think that's really what speaks to and of course we also have just more Flex3s available in the marketplace. And of course a lot of people have said over time and said some things negatively about those rigs I think but again I think you see the performance in the field today and those rigs are going to continue to go back to work.","So that's a great observation. I appreciate that.","Brad Handler","No problem. If it\u2019s okay maybe I\u2019ll squeeze in one more and maybe you can keep it short but I appreciate if you indulge me. Just coming back to the contracting maybe a little color on contracting strategy, I guess I understand you got a little bit of premium but I might have imagined you would be optimistic about getting much better day rates at some point not too far in the distant future.","So I guess how far does - can you draw some of the parameters around when you would choose to contract for a year at this point, how much of the fleet you would be willing to do, what maybe drove some of the decisions to engage in those contract at this point.","John Lindsay","Well again great question. Obviously you know that there is a lot of competitive challenges associated with us discussing our pricing strategy or what we're going to do from a spot market from a term contract perspective. I mean we have - we have some plans in place. We\u2019ve been through many of these cycles and again this one moved very, very quickly and as we all know that there was so much negativity it was hard to believe. I think most people felt like well, just any minute you are going to see oil prices go back down and things start slowing down again.","So we\u2019re going to - I think we're going to go, take advantage going forward as far as better pricing and that's about all - that's about all I can say as far as additional details on it.","Brad Handler","I understand that's perfectly reasonable. I appreciate that answer so thank you.","David Hardie","Thank you Brad, thank you everybody. We'll hand the call to John for a few closing comments.","John Lindsay","Yes, if there is anyone there - hanging in there with us, I appreciate it. Thanks for being on the call with us. I just wanted to finish just by saying that the company has gone through really extensive efforts to enhance our organizational and system's health and while we aren't finished, I think we are making great strides and we're going to continue to improve. We are really pleased with our ability to respond to the increasing level of demand in the marketplace that we\u2019ve seen and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to continue to gain incremental market share.","Our competitive advantages remain in our people and our performance, technology, reliability and as we discussed our uniform FlexRigs fleet gives us many advantages. These advantages should allow us to continue to outpace our competitors and regain pricing power during this recovery especially as customer well designs become increasingly more complex and require higher spec AC drive rigs.","So again thank you for your time today and have a great day. We'll see you at the next call. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's first quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a great day."],"11014":["Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

Please go ahead.","David Wilson","Thank you, Nikki, and welcome everyone to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. With us today on the call are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Mark Smith, Senior Vice President and CFO. John and Mark will be sharing some comments with us, after which, we will open the call for questions.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I will remind everyone that this call will include Forward-Looking Statements as defined under the Securities Laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date, and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements.","We also make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You will find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations in yesterday's press release.","With that said, I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 2019 was a challenging year for the industry overall, but it is during these seasons when our industry comes together to create stronger partnerships and embrace new ways of thinking and innovation. This is what we are experiencing and it can contribute to our results.","Today, we will share some additional context about how H&P's leadership position and performance both of which continue to improve because of the Company's ability to simultaneously deliver incremental value for customers, adapt to increasingly difficult market conditions and advance the future of automation and drilling.","This quarter's results reflect the momentum of shared successes with customers and the Company's ability to remain agile and focused on results from our customers and for H&P stakeholders. I'm going to begin talking about our experience with what we are seeing exploration and production companies value drivers.","Our customers are looking for every opportunity to invest optimally. They are seeking the best partner with the best expertise and experience that can transcend today's challenging market environment.","We strive to align ourselves with the customers objective to enhance economic returns through better performance and technology. We are working hard to put this shared focus and decision making at the forefront of all of our partnerships.","Our strategy is focused on strengthening all of our current customer relationships and building more along the way. We believe technology and automation will be the catalyst for value creation in upstream oil and gas operations.","There is power in predictability through reliable and repeatable performance provided by process excellence and automation. And we are seeing that payoff for H&P and for our customers. This concerted effort will continue to set us apart and I believe it is one of the reasons why we are gaining traction.","We see significant value capture opportunities resulting from our autonomous drilling platform. For our customers maturing basins and normalized well cycle times are drawing more attention to the advantages that wellbore quality delivers.","Our automation solutions specifically AutoSlide, which is automated sliding while directional drilling have numerous points of differentiation from competing services in the market today. The primary and most customer-centric differentiation is our AutoSlide algorithms are tuned with wellbore economics and each customers' value drivers in mind. Specifically, these algorithms optimize the trade-off between drilling days, time in the hydrocarbon zone and wellbore [Indiscernible].","As the industry continues to migrate to factory like drilling, economically focused automation will be the key enabler. What we have found is this predictability allows for optimizations of other key drivers that positively impact the total life of the well.","Examples are optimizing completions and providing an opportunity to push the envelope on new methods and techniques that ultimately lead to production increases and lower costs associated with completion.","In addition to creating value for our customers through improved well economics, our technologies reduce the environmental impacts of drilling operations by creating more precise and safer ways to maximize extraction, thus, unlocking even more value with a smaller environmental footprint. And as we de-man at the rig site, fewer exposures at the rig and driving back and forth to the rig.","Since 2017, we have made several digital technology acquisitions and have added significant expertise to our team to complete our digital technology strategy roadmap. The first step of that strategy is wellbore quality and economically focused automation with AutoSlide, and we plan to launch more levels of our autonomous platform during 2020.","We believe we have the expertise and capabilities today to take the next step for our industry without further acquisitions. The power of process automation that drives predictability is paramount for the future of oil and gas. Last year, we introduced the need for new commercial models where we are focused on creating a win-win value capture for our customers and for H&P stakeholders.","Given our customer is focused on spending within budgets, optimizing investment and value, we are continuing to develop new pricing solutions to reflect the growing partnership between H&P and our customers. These solutions reinforce that approach, enabling us to share at an equitable portion of the value we are delivering.","Last quarter, we announced that new commercial contracts made up approximately 10% of our contract mix, during the first fiscal quarter, although today, we have approximately 15% of our active FlexRig fleet contracted under nontraditional day rate contracts, the majority of which are performance-based contracts.","As Mark will discuss in more detail in his remarks, these performance-based contracts aligns H&P's performance and compensation with the customers goals and provide for a commensurate distribution of the incremental value creation.","We are seeing momentum across our primary drilling business segments, as U.S. land rig count fell during 2019, H&P's market share grew from approximately 22% to over 24%, indicating a growing preference for super-spec rigs and the performance these risks deliver relative to legacy SCR rigs and lower performing AC rigs.","Along with market share gains, our quarter end rig count was sequentially higher than the previous quarters ending rig count. We believe capital discipline by our customers will remain a prevailing thing and we expect industry activity to look similar to the average level experienced during the second half of calendar 2019, which implies a modest increase from current levels.","As drilling performance continues to improve, a significant portion of these gains are attributable to the added capabilities and efficiencies from super-spec capacity rigs, an awful effect of this progress are higher daily maintenance costs and higher capital costs related to a third mud comp, 7,500 PSI capacity, multi-well pad capability and more horsepower requirements, but that trade-off is well worth it.","Our experience shows that over a three-year trend that super-spec capacity of FlexRig can drill 15% to 20% more [space] (Ph) than and non-super-spec rigs. Moreover, the super-spec FlexRig incorporates a number of enhancements that improve safety for employees and reduce the environmental impact at a drilling location.","That said, in order to reflect continued efficiency and value gains for E&Ps revenues for rig services that provide optimized drilling solutions need to increase to cover the cost of increased maintenance and supply and capital costs, as well as returns that our shareholders demand.","Mark will address the details of pricing more completely in his prepared remarks, but pricing remains firm for FlexRigs in U.S. land and why shouldn't it. Super-spec utilization is strong, especially in the most active basins and the rigs are delivering high levels of performance and value for customers.","Before shifting to our international segment, another success during 2019 for H&P was growing our partnerships with a major oil and gas companies. We have grown our FlexRig fleet market share to 16% from 6% at the beginning of 2019. And we believe the Company is best positioned to continue to grow our partnerships with the majors and IOCs.","So let's shift to our international segments. This quarter also proved to be positive for our business outside of the U.S. We remain optimistic about the opportunities we are seeing in the Middle East and we were pleased to put a rig back to work in Colombia.","Other rigs in the Middle East are now fully utilized and prospects for further growth in this region are encouraging and would likely result in the exporting of additional FlexRig drilling rigs from the U.S. to satisfy any demand.","As we hear about unconventional resource plays in the Middle East and South America, our experience, our expertise and our technologies will continue to put us in a great position to grow in the future.","So in closing, financial discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet are hallmarks of the Company and set us apart from many industries peers. H&P has paid cash dividend to shareholders since 1960 and last year, we increased the annualized dividend per share for the 48th consecutive year.","In thinking about culture and how that can set a company apart in an industry. We are in the midst of a momentous year at H&P. 2020 is our centennial year and we are using some of this time to reflect our history. So primarily, we are looking at our path forward. In keeping with this milestone, we will remain focused on maintaining our position as the industry's most trusted partner and drilling productivity and technological innovation.","Our people have always been dedicated to helping our business through the ups and downs of our industry. And we know that our employees, combined with our rig fleet and technology solutions are the key to our continued long-term success.","And now I will turn the call over to Mark Smith.","Mark Smith","Thanks, john. Today, I will review our fiscal first quarter 2020 operating results, provide guidance for the second quarter, update full fiscal year 2020 guidance as appropriate and comment on our financial position.","Let us start with highlights for the recently completed first quarter. The Company generated quarterly revenues of $615 million versus $649 million in the previous quarter. The quarterly decrease in revenue is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of rigs working in the U.S. land segment as expected.","Total operating costs incurred were $401 million for the first quarter versus $432 million for the previous quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to the aforementioned activity decline. General and administrative expenses totaled $50 million for the first quarter in-line with our expectations. Our Q1 effective tax rate was approximately 32%, which is slightly higher than our guided range due to a discrete tax expense.","Summarizing the overall results of this quarter, H&P incurred a profit is $0.27 per diluted share versus earning of profit $0.37 in the previous quarter. First quarter earnings per share were positively impacted by a net $0.14 per share of select items as highlighted in our Press Release.","Absent the select items, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.13 in the first quarter versus an adjusted $0.38 during the fourth fiscal quarter. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $46 million, this amount is under our implied guided run rate due to the timing of various projects.","Turning to our four segments, beginning with the U.S. Land segment. We exited the first fiscal quarter with 195 contracted rigs, which was, as John mentioned, the first time since calendar year 2018 that we have seen a sequential increase in activity.","H&P increased its U.S. Land market share to 24% by quarter end due to the continued sidelining of less capable legacy rigs in the industry. As John discussed, we expect to see a modest increase in rig count during the second fiscal quarter.","Pricing remains firm in the super-spec market space during the first fiscal quarter, our average rig revenue per day excluding early termination revenue increased to $25,397 for the quarter, which was slightly above our guidance. As a reminder from our November call, this figure excludes our FlexApps offerings, which are now included in our H&P Technology segment.","Helmerich & Payne\u2019s average pricing per day varies from basin-to-basin due to both underlying hydrocarbon economics and competitive rig supply dynamics. Further, as John stated, our pricing is differentiated due to the unique value we deliver our customers as evidenced by our leading market share.","In addition to the dynamics specific to each market, pricing variations are also driven by other variables including term coverage and customer concentration. Our current pricing remains in the low to mid-20s with an overall average around 23,000 per day. As a reminder, Flex services including trucking, casing, running, rental equipment, et cetera are additive to day rate and are included in revenue per day of $25,397.","As John discussed, our performance contracts are gaining ground, as a larger portion of the fleet is shifting to this commercial model. As H&P provides value to our customers such as by reducing their overall well spread costs and H&P participates in that savings creation. These performance contracts are now generating approximately $500 per day, more in margin than our average day rate and model margins produced.","The average adjusted rig expense per day increased to $14,987 this is above our previously guided range, primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured medical expenses incurred in the fourth calendar quarter, which is the final quarter of the medical plan year.","Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2020 for U.S. Land, we exited the first quarter with 195 rigs working and currently we have 197 rigs turning to the right. Customer conversations lead us to believe that there will be a decrease of approximately 10% in CapEx spend in calendar 2020 compared to calendar 2019 level.","This implies that the number of wells drilled in 2020 would decline by 2,300 from the 16,400 wells drilled during the calendar year 2019, an approximate 14% decrease. To close some of this gap, we would expect to see a modest accretion to the exiting rig count in the calendar year end.","With that caveat, we are also anticipating that our customers will spend budgeted rig CapEx and a more even rate throughout this calendar year. Given that, we expect to exit the second quarter with between 193 and 203 active rigs. This would result in a modest sequential increase in the quarterly number of revenue days, which translates to an average rig count of approximately 196 rigs during the second quarter.","As the market tightens and as opportunities to displace legacy rigs arise, our initial objective is to put the 45 idle super-spec rigs we currently have back to work. Also, we still have 44 FlexRigs that are upgradable to super-spec when and if market conditions warrant that investment.","Compared to the first quarter at $25,397 per day, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to be within a range from $25,000 to $25,500.Our average day rate in both the spot and term markets remains in the lowmid-20s range and leading edge super-spec FlexRig pricing is also at that same level.","The average rig expense per day is expected to be in a range of $14,650 to $15,150 for the second quarter. While our overall the rig count has stabilized, we will continue to incur costs to re-commission idle rig and\/or stack out active rigs due to ordinary rig churn across basins.","The per day cost here can vary considerably depending on the type of rig and the market dynamics in the basins for the activity is occurring. We will also continue to incur costs associated with maintaining now a portion of our fleet.","At the start of this fiscal year, we elected to set up a wholly owned insurance captive to ensure the deductibles for our workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liability insurance programs from October 1, 2019 forward.","Our operating segments pay monthly premiums to the captive for the estimated losses based on external actuarial analysis. The result is a transfer of risk from our operating subsidiaries to the captive for the deductibles which is our self-insurance retention.","We do not expect any significant changes in our ongoing segment per day expenses as a result of this shift. The insurance premiums are included in the operating segment expenses and are included in intersegments sales and the other non-reportable segment.","These intercompany premium revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation. The actuarial estimated underwriting expenses for the three months ended December 31, was approximately $8.5 million and was recorded within the other operating expenses line item and our audited condensed consolidated statement of operations.","We had an average of 129 active rigs under term contract during the first fiscal quarter and today that number remains 129 or about 65% of our 197 working rigs. We expect to have an average of 126 rigs under term contract and in the fiscal second quarter and earning of current average day rate. 103 rigs currently remain under term contract through the last three quarters of fiscal 2020.","Regarding our International Lands segment, the number of quarterly revenue days is relatively flat in the first fiscal quarter, slightly above our guidance. The adjusted average rig margin per day in the segment increased by $1731 to $7208 in the first fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily due to lower than anticipated cost associated with some of our rigs in Argentina among other factors.","As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal 2020 for International, quarterly revenue days are expected to decrease approximately 7% with an average second quarter rig count of approximately 16 to 17 active rigs in the segment. We have been successful in redeploying all five of the rigs we currently have in the middle East.","And while these additions have not been incremental to our international rig count. They have served to mitigate the rigs that have rolled off contract in Argentina. We remain optimistic that there will be opportunities in Argentina to put rigs back to work. However, the timing is uncertain.","The average rig margin is expected to decrease to a range of $6,000 to $7,000 per day during the second fiscal quarter, as decreasing startup cost in the Middle East are more than offset by the impact of the idling Argentina rigs rolling off of their five year NFC contracts. Additionally, we incurred unplanned maintenance expenses during the startup phase of putting an idle rig back to work in Columbia.","Turning to Offshore Operations segment. We averaged six platform rigs working in the first fiscal quarter. We exited the quarter with six contracted rigs. However, one rig has since then released and mobilized. The average rate margin per day increased sequentially due to the unexpected maintenance downtime incurred in the previous quarter.","As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal of 2020 for the Offshore Segment, we currently have five of our right offshore rigs contracted. One of those five rigs is in the shipyard, as it transitions from one Gulf of Mexico customer to another and is expected to recommence drilling operations in late March. The average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to a range of 10,000 to 11,000 during the second quarter, due to the reduced activity.","Finally, looking at our H&P Technology segment, HPT revenues were largely in-line with our expectations. HPT operating income was approximately $2 million, when excluding research and development cost of $6 million.","We are expecting Q2 revenue HPT to be between $16 million to $19 million inclusive of FlexApps. As our teams leverage recent successes, we expect continued growth in customer adoption during a stable to modestly increasing rig count environment.","In December 2019, we closed on the sale of TerraVici Drilling Solutions Inc resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $15 million. As a reminder, we wrote off the intangibles related to TerraVici in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018.","Now let me look forward on corporate items for the second fiscal quarter and the remainder of this fiscal year. At December year end, and as of today's call, our revenue backlog from our U.S. Land segment was roughly $900 million for rigs under term contract with early termination provisions.","Capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2020 year are still expected to range between $275 million to $300 million based on our current outlook for fiscal 2020, which as a reminder is approximately a 40% reduction to 2019 CapEx. We [expected] (Ph) $46 million in the first quarter, which is less than the implied quarterly run rate of our guidance due to timing differences of procurement activities and project progression.","As we mentioned in the Press Release, assets sales are primarily customer reimbursement for the replacement value of drill pipe that is damaged or lost in hole during drilling operations. These sales offset a large portion of our tubular purchase bucket of CapEx. Our previously communicated expectations for full fiscal 2020 general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, depreciation and effective tax rates are unchanged.","Now, looking at our financial position. Helmerich & Payne had cash and short-term investments of approximately $412 million at December 31, versus $401 million as a September 31, 2019. We earned cash flow from operations of approximately $112 million and fiscal Q1.","The sequential decrease in cash flow was due to some of our conversion factors including reduced activity, annual payment of accrued short-term incentive compensation plan, seasonal holiday slow down of receivable collections and the payment of the legal settlement that was accrued and disclosed in the previous quarter.","We expect cash flows from operations to be higher in the remaining quarters of our fiscal year. Our debt-to-capital at quarter end of 11% which is a continued best-in-class measurements amongst our peer group. A reminder we have no debt maturing until 2025.","Our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2020 include operating activity levels and pricing to generate sufficient free cash flow to cover our selling general and administrative expenses, debt service costs, planned capital expenditures and current dividends while modestly accreting our cash-on-hand.","Our balance sheet strength, liquidity level and term contract backlog provide H&P the flexibility to adapt to market conditions, take advantage of attractive opportunities and maintain our long practice of returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.","That concludes our prepared comments for the first fiscal quarter. Let me now turn the call over to Nikki for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jacob Lundberg from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jacob Lundberg","Hey, good morning guys.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Jacob Lundberg","Just to start off, I wanted to drill down on the performance based contracts that you mentioned. Could you just help us think about how quickly that mix can grow as a percent of your total work. You had a nice increase in fiscal 1Q. Do you anticipate that to continue? And then anything you could provide in terms of your desired mix of traditional versus performance-based would be helpful.","John Lindsay","Okay. Jacob, this is John. It is hard to know for sure how we can impact the mix. What I do feel positive about is that we are taking a customer centric approach to these new commercial models you know where every customer obviously looks at things, looks at costs, looks at their particular program a little bit differently.","So we are trying to align it with what their drivers are. Most of these, contracts have been performance based contracts. So there is a true win-win for both the customer and an H&P in this case. So our hope is that we will be able to continue to do more of that.","One way to think about it is most of the rigs that have the potential of entering into these types of contracts are generally in the spot market rigs, as opposed to those that are already under term contract.","But again, I think there is an opportunity for us to do more. As you said, we had a nice improvement. Our salesforce continues to adapt to this. We have made lots of investments in the organization to create the infrastructure that we need to manage these types of contracts.","So again, our hope is to continue to grow it. As far as the total mix, again, that is hard to say as well. But, I suspect that as we get more mature and our customers see the benefits that we will be able to enter into more of those.","Jacob Lundberg","And do you have a desire to ultimate mix? Would you go pure performance base if the market was there or would you like to maintain some portion of the fleet still on the traditional structure?","John Lindsay","Well, I think, you know, Mark had mentioned it in his remarks that, our average revenue is higher on our performance-based contracts. Obviously, we are taking some associated risk, when you do that. You know, again, it is hard to say what kind of a mix in terms of total, but we are definitely interested in doing more.","I think the likelihood, the reality of it, at least anytime soon to have the whole fleet on performance or some other type of commercial model besides day rate, probably isn't achievable, realistically.","Jacob Lundberg","Okay. And then a follow-up if I could, on the performance based contracts. Could you just talk about the spread? So if on average you are seeing $500 a day more on the performance-based contracts, what does that spread look like? Presumably there is some jobs that don't go your way and maybe it is even a negative impact I would imagine there somewhere it is significantly more positive than 500 and maybe what does that spread look like? And then overtime, where do you think you can bring that total average incremental day rate on those contracts?","John Lindsay","Yes, that is a tough one. You are accurate in that. We are not going to achieve, if you are talking about performance contract. You are not going to achieve it every time. Obviously the goal is, at the end of the day, to be able to have a higher revenue than what we would achieve with a day rate contract.","So, we are still in the early stages, even though we have been at this for a year. Our industry in some respects moves pretty, pretty slow on things like this. I really want to stress that it is a partnership with our customer.","You are only going to be able to have these sorts of arrangements types of contracts with customers if you have a pretty good relationship with and are able to get in and negotiate something that again is a true win-win for both parties.","Jacob Lundberg","Do you think it would be fair to say that, overtime there is an ability to increase the $500 number though?","John Lindsay","I would sure hope so. I mean, we have examples where at several thousand dollars obviously you do have those that don't work at your way for one reason or another. But again, we are an organization that has a lot of data, a lot of information. I think that we can continue to help our customers to drill wells more effectively.","Jacob Lundberg","Alright. I appreciate it. Great quarter guys. Thank you.","John Lindsay","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tommy Moll from Steven Inc. Your line is open.","Tommy Moll","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.","John Lindsay","Sure, Tommy.","Tommy Moll","So, wanted to start on H&P Technology, specifically AutoSlide, which it looks like is now on six basins. In a macro environment as you indicated you expect for this year and maybe slight uptake in rig count, but continue capital discipline among customers. How do you feel about the adoption going forward for AutoSlide? Are we still in the early days where the adoption rates slow? Or do you feel like we are getting closer to an inflection point?","John Lindsay","Well, Tommy, I think we have had a nice improvement in adoption since September 30. Our AutoSlide rig count is at 15 today. I think we are around seven. So we have more than doubled since September 30.","So we have had some nice adoption. There is I think in some respects because of capital discipline and there are some adverse effects I think that you end up dealing with on the adoption side. And then the other side is just as we have said before, it is a pretty significant change in workflow at the rig side. So there is a real need for change management.","But over the last several months we have obviously achieved a lot of success. And as you said, we are in six basins today, they are the most active basins and we are having some success. So we are getting some adoptions.","So our expectation is that we continue to grow. We would love to be a layout for you. What our ultimate - while we are being eight successive quarter. But so much of that really depends on how quickly customers can adapt to the AutoSlide situation and that we are changing the workflow and we are demanding in most cases.","I think 60% or 70% of the AutoSlide jobs we have today are fully de-manned as far as the directional driller not being on the rig, which is a great thing. It is a great thing for the customer. It is a great thing for the industry, because of the reliability piece, less exposure, but it is disruptive.","Tommy Moll","Thank you John. And just sticking with the technology theme, you mentioned in your remarks that there could be more announcements coming in 2020 on the autonomous drilling theme. I expect we will have to wait for some press releases to get the full details on any of those, but could you give us even just high level some of the different pieces of the drilling process that you think are right for disruption with some autonomous solutions?","John Lindsay","I think what I prefer to do Tommy is wait and roll it out on a little - with greater clarity in what I would be able to give you right now. But the fact is there are some things that are done at the rig site that are highly people oriented obviously. And there is a lot of variability in the performance because of the human interaction and there are things that are right for automation, they are right for developing algorithms to replace that and to add a more factory like outcome.","So, there will be more to come on that. I wish I could tell you exactly when that is. But, I think in the next quarter or two, we will be able to have another commercial announcement that we will roll in nicely with AutoSlide.","Tommy Moll","Okay. We will stay tuned for the updates and I will turn it back. Thank you.","John Lindsay","Alright. Thanks, Tommy.","Operator","We will take our next question Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Thanks. Hi, good morning.","Mark Smith","Good morning, Sean.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Sean Meakim","Can we talk about the change in quarterly profitability for H&P Technologies and how you would be guiding investors going forward? I guess I'm trying to think about the buckets that are driving the change, is it just absorption of higher volumes, R&D is separated? Are there mixed considerations? Just trying to think about, how to understand the fundamentals, it is just going to be probably a little bit tough to navigate that quarter-over-quarter?","Mark Smith","Thanks, Sean. There are several moving parts in there, and because of that we are going to keep our guidance for the near-term really at a top revenue line item. To your point, there is increased adoption of some products, especially the new AutoSlide product that John has been speaking of this morning.","You also have some price accretion on a per unit basis as we work with different contracting models. AutoSlide importantly is not on a day rate model. We have various forms of contract and as we move through some of these early days, we will probably land on the best few forms of contract that are mutually beneficial to the customer and ourselves.","So, until we get to that point, it is really a sort of a top-line guidance. Obviously, we have much more discreet internal goals, but those are moving as well as we learn more through this process.","Sean Meakim","That is very helpful. Are you able to give us any hindsight color on the prior quarter relative to the one before that?","Mark Smith","Not at this stage, Sean. Not at this stage.","Sean Meakim","Okay. Fair enough. Maybe. So switching to international, could you maybe just give us a sense of what you see is an opportunity set in terms of number of rigs that could be exported from the U.S. over whatever timeframes you are comfortable with, next 12 months or something? And just curious how those latest contract terms are looking relative to prior between Latin America and the middle East?","Mark Smith","Well, as John mentioned, we are excited to put a rig back to work in Columbia and we continue to have marketing discussions in that country. We still on a long-term basis are excited about the unconventional play in Argentina and are being patient there as our customers are as we sort through the new dynamics in that country.","But, we do have rigs rolling off of the original YPF five-year contracts through the rest of this calendar year, and we had been in and continue to be in discussions with IOCs and other players related to the redeployment of those rigs.","As it relates to the Middle East, I would be a bit more cautious, if you will, in trying to provide any specific guidance. We have a numerous discussion that is happening in various countries in the Middle East and are very excited about being able to participate in unconventional plays as they began to really take shape at scale in some countries there.","So, excited to be participating in discussions, those range from preliminary discussions all the way through to the Tinder type of discussions. And it is early days, but we have 45 idle super-specs in the United States that are great candidates to put to some of those opportunities when they come to fruition.","Sean Meakim","So you wouldn't be able to characterize changes in rates or term at high level across any of those markets? ","Mark Smith","Not yet. No. The FlexRigs we think can really add value in the middle East. And we also have some HPT trials happening with some of the HPT Technology products as we speak there as well. And who knows, as we have discussed in previous calls the Technology could be a rig pull through.","Sean Meakim","Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.","John Lindsay","Thanks Sean.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi from Cowen. Your line is open.","Marc Bianchi","Thank you. Just following up to the question on HPT and profitability. I appreciate that you don't want to give us any guidance, but if I just kind of assume what we had in the most recent quarters, $10 million bucks of gross profit and that I take U.S. Land and International and offshore all at the mid points of your guidance. I kind of get $210 million of gross profit. I'm wondering what else we need to deduct from that to get to your EBITDA? Because we have got this insurance thing this quarter that is a new item and then obviously G&A and perhaps R&D from there.","Mark Smith","There is several things built into your question there, Marc. As it relates to the - first of all, let me just address the insurance captive. From a segment operating expense perspective there is no change there. It is just transferring of those premiums to the captive.","Again it is intersegment revenue to the captive, which is in eliminated and consolidation. And it is a big self-insurance retention and deductible. And so we are managing that retention a bit differently through the captive. But from a segment expense perspective, really no change. As it relates to HPT?","Marc Bianchi","Sorry, go ahead. Mark, can I just clarify that just because you are on it on the insurance piece. So of that 210 of gross profit, that is all in the segments. There is no additional deduction that I would need to make to that to get to your EBITDA as it relates to the insurance.","Mark Smith","You can see that in the segment reconciliation, which is in the press release and will be in the 10-Q filed later today.","John Lindsay","And Marc, we can walk you through the kind of the reconciliation offline.","Marc Bianchi","Yes, I think it is good to talk about it live, cause I'm getting a lot of questions about it. So perhaps other investors are very interested. Mark, you were going to talk about the G&A and the R&D.","Mark Smith","Yes, the G&A. I think we have all the components to get to your EBITDA number. Marc really, but specific to your HPT question in particular on any more details within there. We have a growing revenue base, as we have said before we are excited about it, because the technology is really software and service.","So in these initial deployments, we are really getting started. We have a bit of a variable operating expenditures, but through time, we expect that to be a really margin accretive portion of the business is what we have talked about. The G&A related to HPT in particular is pretty fixed and the R&D is as well.","As I mentioned in my opening comments, we don't have any changes to the full-year guidance. Once we get through the technology roadmap that John has articulated, we will through time have R&D drop-off obviously.","And once you move to a sort of maintenance, if you will on the software, so you go from version-to-version as opposed to new software. But that is a bit out in our planning horizon. So, if you stick with the numbers we mentioned in November for yearly G&A and R&D et cetera, you will be able to get to your EBITDA.","Marc Bianchi","Got it. Got it. That is great, Mark. Thanks. And then just if I could on kind of M&A, I caught the comment that you don't need to do any more M&A to build out the automation capability, but you did make the comment in the press release about having kind of ample flexibility to take advantage of additional investment opportunities. So I'm just curious, you know, what that might be referring to and help maybe set some expectations for M&A for us.","John Lindsay","Well, Marc. From an M&A perspective, you have heard in the past what we don't plan to do, which is any consolidation in the industry, as far as rigs go. I think the investments that that we will be making are on the technology side, there is obviously the potential to grow internationally as Mark mentioned, continuing to enhance the fleet based upon customer demands and that is where we are going to be investing.","Marc Bianchi","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. I will turn it back.","John Lindsay","Thanks Marc.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.","David Anderson","So, John, we are talking about AutoSlide and how to improve your performance also talking about - contracts. So I'm just wondering how the two work together on kind of the 15% of your business, which is these new commercial models. Are you employing AutoSlide in any of those contracts yet?","John Lindsay","You know, there had been some overlap in bids that we have made. I can't speak to any particular right now that we have. But it is definitely in the discussion. To your point, I think it does make a lot of sense as we grow the AutoSlide functionality and automation in general. I think there is that potential there.","David Anderson","And then, also we just talked a little bit about the customer mix. I'm just kind of curious of that 15%. Is that more skewed towards the bigger operators? I'm just curious which types of customers are more receptive to that, because I also certainly noted how you talk about your share of the majors had gone up. I'm wondering if those are related.","John Lindsay","Really the answer to the first part of your question is, we have interest and have contracts right now with large and small E&Ps, and I expect that that is going to go into continue. These performance contracts are not related to the growth on the major side of the equation.","But, I wouldn't rule it out longer-term. I mean, let's face it, the majors are very much value-oriented and I think as they look at ways to enhance value, not only time-based value, but overall lifecycle of the well value. I think we have a lot of opportunity to grow there. So, hopefully that gives us some opportunity going forward.","David Anderson","Yes, I would certainly think so. I just wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit about the growth opportunity in the Middle East. I think the last time I saw, a couple of rigs operating in Bahrain and a couple of rigs idle in UAE. Could you just tell us how you said we have five rigs operating at Middle East today. Could you just talk a little bit about where those are? It looks like you reactivating in UAE. We just saw an announcement came out about a big unconventional play in UAE, which I wonder if that is related. And also if you wouldn't mind just also just telling us are you qualified in all the major GCC countries in the Middle East, particularly Saudi? I don't remember you ever working in Saudi, just wondering if you are qualified there?","John Lindsay","I will just start it off with the five that you mentioned specifically. I think if you went back a year ago at this time we had one rig working in Bahrain, two idle there and to idle and Abu Dhabi. And interestingly last year we closed our Ecuador operation because of its subscale size and we really have the same size operations in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi that we purposely kept those open as marketing venues, sensing what could be a developing unconventional play in several countries there. And that is coming to fruition, all five of those rigs are now working, continue to have a perspective customers going to visit them as well. And yes that is exciting opportunities in many countries there including the UAE.","David Anderson","What about Saudi? Are you qualified there?","John Lindsay","We do have an entity in Saudi Arabia, legal entity I should say. And we have the entities at various countries actually in the Middle East.","David Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Scott Gruber","Yes. Good morning. ","John Lindsay","Good morning. Scott.","Scott Gruber","Question on working capital for Mark. So working capital it sounds like it should improve going forward. Do you have any color for us on whether working capital will be a benefit or a cash drag for HP for the full-year?","Mark Smith","It should improve, as I mentioned in the comments. I think we are going to be relatively stable activity level. So I think working capital will be relatively stable as well as appose to being a big benefit or drag honestly.","Having said that, we at H&P are still trying to turn over every rock we can and we had some successful working capital projects last fiscal year. And this year we have more that we are looking at including an assessment of our inventory levels.","Scott Gruber","Got it and just back on the U.S. Land, do you think your rate premium appears in U.S. Land has widened and not just relative to the smaller players, but even relative to some of your bigger, like on primary competitors. You think your rate premium has actually widened a bit there?","Mark Smith","Scott, I know our other drilling peers, at least I don't believe they have reported yet. I don't have the details of the data to know if it is widened. I think in general we have had pricing discipline in our sector. As I have mentioned, the rigs are performing at a high level and adding a lot of value.","And so, I think in general it is in everyone's best interest to continue to keep pricing at reasonable levels or today's levels. And again, I think there is an argument to be made, that because of the cost side of the equation and rigs working harder, that there is an element for increasing revenues in order to cover those expenses.","Scott Gruber","Got it. That is it for me. Thank you. Thanks for the color.","Mark Smith","Thanks Scott.","John Lindsay","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chase Mulvelhill with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Chase Mulvelhill","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to come back to the performance base of the new commercial models that you are pushing out to the market. So, if we kind of do some back of the envelope math, it kind of looks like you may be saving, 15,000 to 20,000 per well. Could you kind of walks through the different pieces of cost savings that you are saving for your customer? How much of it is you are drilling faster versus kind of taking people off or maybe cannibalizing some of the other drilling services. So, just kind of help us understand, the different buckets for the value proposition to your customer.","John Lindsay","Chase, I would say most of the shared savings are related to time, and as you look at a real simple example is 15-day well and two days of savings, and a total spread rate of $150,000 total between those two days, and then you essentially share those savings. So, let's say you split the savings. So, on a 15-day well, you have got $5,000 a day type of additional revenue.","I'm trying to give you a simple example. There are other KPI type - key performance indicator type models as well, where customers want to focus on specific items during the course of the well. I don't have all those at the tip of my tongue right now.","But most of those are areas that they are having challenges and\/or there is an opportunity for us to come in and perform at a higher level than what our peer would be doing and we are able to do that by essentially going in with a little bit lower rate and then earning a higher rate.","Chase Mulvelhill","Got it. Okay. A quick follow-up just on the performance-based contracts. If we think about, how you are trying to attack the risk side? If you think about what kind of risks you are absorbing on the third-party service providers, how do you protect yourself there? And then also, you know, with performance-based contracts, it always seems like a perpetual kind of resetting of the baseline as performance continues to improve. So how do you protect yourself on that element as well?","John Lindsay","Well, that is a very good question. You obviously seen these types of contracts overtime and there can be some negative results as a result of either resetting framework or the third-parties. I think as we look at our experience and expertise and the data set that we have.","You know, we have a pretty good handle on obviously the customer that we are working with, the partnership that we share have a pretty good understanding of those areas that are particularly or have been particularly a problem in the past.","And obviously one of those is the directional drilling component. We obviously have a significant expertise in directional drilling. Internally with the directional drillers and then obviously AutoSlide algorithms. So lots of data at our fingertips that we didn't previously have before.","So I think it helps us actually work with our customers to even potentially high-grade some of the third-parties that are working jointly with us on location. So overall, I'm not overly concerned or bothered by the third-party piece of the equation. Obviously the reset that you mentioned is just something that you have to work out in the contract.","But again, as I think about our industry and how we have really changed and improved overtime in that we are working together more as partners with our customers. And I think that obviously they want us to win because if we win they win. Right. And so there is an opportunity for both parties to come out in a better place.","Chase Mulvelhill","Awesome. Good to hear that your customers are willing to work to with you. Alright. Thanks John.","John Lindsay","Alright Chase. Thank you.","Operator","And I will now turn the program back to John Lindsay for any closing remarks.","John Lindsay","Alright, Nikki, thank you and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate it. We are looking forward to celebrating our Centennial during 2020, as I said earlier, but what we are really doing is looking ahead to our bright future, looking forward to that. And, thank you all and have a great day.","Operator","This does concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your line. And have a good day. everyone."],"11011":["Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Dave Wilson - Director, IR","John Lindsay - President, and CEO","Mark Smith - VP, CFO","Conference Call Participants","Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","Scott Gruber - Citigroup","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Sean Meakim - JP Morgan","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Fiscal Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call for Helmerich & Payne. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dave Wilson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Dave Wilson","Thank you, Priscilla, and welcome everyone to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Mark Smith, Vice President and CFO. John and Mark will be sharing some comments with us, after which, we'll open the call for questions.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'll remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the Securities Laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date, and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As such, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.","You can learn more about these risks in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and our other SEC filings. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. And we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements. We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You will find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations in yesterday's press release.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. From the outset, this quarter was challenged with industry uncertainty. So, I am pleased to report that the company not only stayed on target and delivered sequentially improved net income, but also achieved two significant milestones. Concern over crude oil prices persisted from the prior quarter, which softened demand for incremental super-spec rigs. However, H&P completed the planned upgrade already in the pipeline.","With those rigs, we added significant term backlog at attractive rates and margins, and our total number of super-spec FlexRigs increased to 230 at quarter end, representing more than 40% of the industry's U.S. super-spec capacity. Our current U.S. rig count is approximately 220 FlexRigs. Considering the trends we are seeing in rig releases, the higher levels of churn across certain basins and the current demand, we believe the Company's rig count will bottom out early during this third fiscal quarter. And FlexRig super-spec utilization will remain in the 90% plus range.","Importantly, this level of utilization should be supportive of the current pricing environment. Another factor that is supporting super-spec pricing is the top five U.S. land drillers own approximately 80% of the active super-spec fleet. With the industry super-spec fleet already over 90% utilized, this degree of supply concentration also promotes a sturdier pricing environment going forward.","The oil price for WTI is up over 40% since the beginning of the calendar year. In past cycles, this kind of price action would bring on higher activity. Yet today, we are seeing a more temperate response and even reductions in activity by some in the industry. Clearly, customer behavior is changing, and the movement is towards prioritization of cash flows and less focus on growth. This returns focused approach has put additional emphasis on disciplined spending and determining where value can be added to improve performance and long-term cash flow.","Principles that are focused on returns resonate with H&P and are aligned with our goal to deliver performance to both the customer and the shareholder. We believe we are exceptionally positioned in this kind of environment with the right hardware, a FlexRig fleet that is an industry leader in drilling unconventional wells and with the right software, a digital technology platform focused on wellbore quality and placement that when deployed on a rig are proven to improve well economics.","Further, these principles align with our own capital allocation policy. Part of which includes returning cash to shareholders through our dividend for the last 60 years and with an increasing dividend over the past 47 years. On our January call, we said our customers had a mix of outlooks regarding CapEx. They were up, down, and flat. We also expected our customers would be setting in their 2019 budgets with an expectation of $50 to $55 WTI.","We compared the public company and majors announced CapEx budgets for 2019 compared to 2018 and found the totaled budgeted CapEx is only down approximately 5% year-over-year. This supports the view we expressed on our January call that the rig count reduction would likely be less than a 100 horizontal rigs. And thus far, the rig is down approximately 70 rigs. Further to that, H&P's top 25 customers, which represent about 80% of our working rigs, reduced their CapEx budgets by an aggregate of approximately 4% for 2019.","Even with the current price of approximately $65 a barrel, we are reticent to expect that the overall industry rig count will do more then remain flat through the rest of this quarter. Of course, there is the caveat and I would like this to be true, oil prices remained strong and we experienced less oil price volatility and the rig count improves in the back half of 2019. We know of at least one public E&P who has index or capital allocation strategy including CapEx to align with the price of WTI. If that practice is more common than we know and if the private E&Ps would take advantage of higher oil prices, perhaps, we'll have better rig activity than flat in the second half of 2019.","With the trend toward multi-well pads, the industry has ushered in the need for additional manufacturing type requirements. It isn't sufficient to only drill wells fast and efficiently anymore, but it's also important to have a higher quality, reliability and more accurately placed wellbore. Industry studies have documented that wellbores with less tortuosity produced more oil and more accurately placed wellbores produced fewer parent child well interference issues. Both of these factors are important to consider as customers want and need to do more with less.","I will touch on this more in a minute when discussing our new H&P Technologies segment. But let me begin with our first milestone achieved during the quarter. We have a commitment to send our first super-spec FlexRig overseas. We have long believed H&P's drilling leadership position in the US unconventional basins would lead to further international opportunities to deploy our US super-spec FlexRigs. Our FlexApps and our H&P technology software solutions including the slide and deploy those overseas. That has come to fruition as we signed a letter of intent to deploy our first super-spec FlexRig from the U.S. land fleet to Argentina later this quarter.","We are excited about this opportunity and not only what it for portends for H&P's Latin American business but other international locations as well. Now let's shift our our focus to the H&P technology segment and the second significant milestone. During the second fiscal quarter, H&P commercialized its drilling automation technology AutoSlide. We believe AutoSlide is the next evolutionary step in drilling automation that is scalable on FlexRigs as a result of our uniform FlexRig operating system.","Our software-based offerings from our H&P technology segment with MOTIVE and MagVAR along with our FlexApps which are designed for FlexRigs to enhance downhole tools and drilling performance. As I mentioned earlier, as customers continue to push the envelope on manufacturing drilling, the benefits of H&P technologies have a meaningful impact on well economics by improving production dynamics and lowering the risk of wellbore interference, thereby bolstering financial returns through the life of the well.","We are committed to partnering with our customers to unlock these benefits that autonomous drilling technologies can provide. Another important differentiation of our technology offerings involves not only the technology platform but also the business model we have developed. Our strategy is unique. Most of our digital technology and software is designed and available on all rigs not just H&P FlexRigs.","This is an important distinction because it allows our customers to utilize the software and datasets across their entire fleet of contracted rigs. So before turning the call over to Mark, I want to close with recognizing that the company achieved excellent operational results and several technical accomplishments during the quarter. Our ability to adapt and respond to uncertain market conditions while securing new opportunities for long-term success is paramount. These achievements are possible without the efforts of our people working as a team to deliver on our goals and by forming strong partnerships with our customers. These efforts exemplify H&P's commitment to excellence.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks, John. Today, I will review our fiscal second quarter 2019 operating results provide guidance for the third quarter, update full fiscal year 2019 guidance as appropriate, and comment on our financial position.","Let's start with highlights for the recently completed second quarter. The company generated quarterly revenues of -- $721 million versus $741 million in the previous quarter. The quarterly decrease in revenue is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of rigs working in the U.S. Land segment as expected.","Total direct operating costs incurred were $443 million for the second quarter versus $489 million for the previous quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower than expected daily operating costs in U.S. Land and to the $18 million effect of a one-time legal settlement in the first fiscal quarter.","The lower operating costs experience were in both regular daily operating maintenance and supplies, as well as on rig reactivation costs. General and administrative expenses totaled $44 million for the second quarter. This is below the run rate for our full year guidance due to the timing of certain company projects, but our full year guidance for G&A has not changed. Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was approximately 26% for the second fiscal quarter, which was in line with our annual expected rate and includes incremental state and foreign taxes as well as the U.S. statutory rate.","Summarizing the overall result of this quarter, H&P earned $0.55 per diluted share versus $0.17 in the previous quarter. Second quarter earnings per share was a negatively impacted by net @0.01 per share of selected -- select items as highlighted in our press release. Asset select items adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.56 in the second quarter versus an adjusted $0.42 during the first fiscal quarter.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $134 million. So when combined with Q1 CapEx, we have expended approximately 65% of our full year CapEx guidance as revise the last quarter. This lines up with our guidance that fiscal 2019 CapEx would be frontloaded.","Turning to our four segments beginning with U.S. Land segment, we exited the second fiscal quarter to 226 contracted rigs, which was a decrease of approximately 1% than the number of active rigs quarter-to-quarter. H&P maintained over 20% U.S. Land market share from quarter-to-quarter. I will discuss this in more detail in a moment. But we anticipate that our rig count will approach a current cycle bottom in the third fiscal quarter. And our super-spec rig class will maintain an average utilization level of approximately 90%.","H&P as leading market share in the top three U.S. basins 24% in the Permian, 39% in the Eagle Ford and 26% in the Scoop\/Stack. Our activity levels in each are 114, 39 and 25 rigs contracted respectively. Despite slowing market conditions in the second fiscal quarter, we were able to maintain pricing in the type super-spec market space. Our average rig revenue per day excluding early termination revenue increased to 25,624 for the quarter in line with our guidance.","Included here is the increasing customer adoption of our FlexApp offerings that are approximately 300 per day per rig in revenues across the fleet from $250 last quarter. The average adjusted rate expense per day decreased to 14,195. This is below our previously guided rains due to lower than expected maintenance and supplies expenses and lower reactivation costs.","Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 for U.S. Land, while putting second fiscal quarter upgrades to work under term contracts, we also experienced a number of late quarter rig releases. We are currently seeing net rig releases moderate, which will result in a sequential decrease of approximately 4% to 6% and the quarterly number of revenue days. This translates to an average rig count of approximately 220 rigs during the third quarter, which is approximately where we are as of today's call.","To reiterate my previous comment, we expect super-spec utilization to remain in the 90% range during the third quarter. Compared to the second quarter at 25,624 per day, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to be flat within a range of 25,500 to 26,000. Our average day rate in both the spot and term markets is in the low to mid 20 ranges and leading edge super-spec flex rig pricing is in the mid 20s. The normalized average rig expense per day directly related to rigs working in the U.S. Land segment remains constant at $13,700 per day. This per day figure excludes the impact of expenses directly related to inactive rigs for the idling and released rigs and the upfront reactivation expenses related to rigs that have been idle for a significant amount of time.","Including these re-costs, the average rig expense per day is expected to be in a range of 14,250 to 14,750 for the third quarter. Note that with the reduced number of upgrades beginning in this quarter, upfront reactivation expenses will continue to come down while moving the average rig expense per day toward the normalized expense per day number of $13,700 through time. However, note that the third quarter will still see reactivation expenses from upgrades that commenced toward the end of the second quarter. We had an average of 149 active rigs under term contracts during the second quarter and today that number is 142 rigs or about 65% of our 220 working rigs. We expect to have an average of 137 rigs under term contract in the fiscal third quarter and 124 rigs in the fourth quarter earning the current average day rates.","For the 79 rigs that remain under term contract in fiscal 2020, the associated day rate is approximately $250 per day higher than today's average. We receive $1.2 million in early termination revenue in the second quarter and have only experienced a couple of early terminations during this calendar year. The remaining terms on these cancellations were not material to our overall revenues. Regarding our International Land segment, the number of quarterly revenue day is decreased 11% in the second fiscal quarter in line with our guidance and due primarily to two rigs Stacking and Colombia early in the quarter as expected.","The adjusted average rig margin per day in the segment increased by $1679 to $11,861 in the second fiscal quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher than expected rig margins which were offset by fewer working rigs in Colombia. As we look toward the third quarter of fiscal 2019 for international, quarterly revenue days are expected to be flat to down slightly with an average third quarter rig count of approximately 17 active rigs in the segment.","The average rig margin is expected to decrease slightly to between $9,000 to $10,000 per day during the third fiscal quarter, due to only one active rig in Colombia absorbing that country's overhead costs. As John mentioned earlier, we are expecting to send their first international super spec rig to Argentina. This rig is expected to commence operations with an international E&P customer midway through the fourth fiscal quarter under a term agreement that will be accretive to our average international margins. In addition just this week, we also signed separately an LOI to reactivated Flex 4 in the country of Bahrain increasing to two Flex 4s in that country.","Turning to our offshore operations segment, we continued with six active rigs during the second fiscal quarter but a second rig moved to standby rate which negatively impacted revenues for the quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially due to the lower standby rate being in effect for most of the quarter as well as higher self-insurance expenses. As we look toward the third quarter of fiscal 2019 for the offshore segment, we currently have the six of eight rigs contracted. The average margin per day is expected to increase to a range of $9500 to $10,500 during the third quarter as two rigs are anticipated to move from the standby rates to full operating rigs.","Now looking at H&P Technology segment, as John mentioned, AutoSlide is now commercial and our plans are to methodically roll it out to our active bases. Timing and rate of adoption of new technology is hard to predict at an early juncture but we believe AutoSlide provides a unique path toward differentiated pricing models for drilling services that are inclusive of wellbore quality and placement services.","From a historical day rate perspective, the potential margin accretion of this software service begins at the anecdotal market day rate for a directional driller of approximately $2,000 per day. Added to this, would be an amount reflecting the value added to our customers for consistent repeatable quality. As previously guided, we are on a path toward autonomous drilling and we are continuing to make significant research and development investments which we believe will result in new services and increased market share over time.","Now let me look for it on corporate items for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our current revenue backlog for the U.S. Land fleet for rigs under term contracts which we define as rig contracts with original fixed terms of at least six months and that contain early termination provisions is approximately $1.4 billion. Capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2019 are expected to remain in the revised range we guided to in January which was $500 million to $530 million.","As a reminder capital investment in our fleet is comprised of three distinct buckets, Bucket 1 contains capital expenditures to upgrade and convert flex rigs to super-spec capacity much of this first bucket was front loaded in the first two fiscal quarters with a total of approximately five walking rig upgrades planned for the remainder of the fiscal year which are backed by term contracts.","The second bucket consists of flex rig capital maintenance which typically ranges between $750,000 to $1 million dollars per active rig per year. The third bucket of 2019 CapEx is comprised of two items, one fiscal year 2019 catch up on bulk spare equipment purchases to support the increased scale of our super-spec fleet over the last two years and two hire capital rig reactivation cost due to the average idle time of reactivated rig being close to four years of stacking.","Our CapEx range includes incremental expenditures as in the aforementioned super-spec rig to Argentina while leaving our overall CapEx range unchanged. We expect to see reduced maintenance CapEx given our current rig activity levels and these along with expenditures for certain bulk purchases will correlate closely with our operating rig counts.","Despite the Q2 timing results, our general and administrative expenses for the full 2019 fiscal year are expected to be roughly flat from 2018 of approximately $200 million in total. G&A will somewhat fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of various company initiatives.","In addition to the U.S. statutory rate, we continue to incur incremental state and foreign income taxes and we are still projecting our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 30%. And now looking at our financial position, Helmerich & Payne had cash and short term investments of approximately $270 million at March 31, 2019. Including our expanded and extended revolving credit facility availability, our liquidity was approximately $1 billion. Our debt to capital at quarter end was approximately 10% the lowest amongst our peer group. We have no debt maturing until 2025.","Our balance sheet strength, liquidity level and term contract backlog provide H&P the flexibility to adapt to market conditions, take advantage of attractive opportunities and maintain our long practice of returning capital to shareholders through our dividend. As we look ahead into the planning horizon, we are confident in the future potential cash flow generation of our fleet. Using our cash flow from operations this second quarter of approximately $200 million as a simple planning proxy, we could generate $800 million of annual run rate cash flow from 220 active U.S. Land rig count together with our 23 current active international and offshore rigs.","Assuming only maintenance CapEx at the annual midpoint guidance of $875,000 per active rig our CapEx annual run rate would be approximately $210 million. The remaining cash flow in the static simple run rate example $590 million would be available for our longstanding dividend and other capital allocation opportunities.","That concludes our prepared comments for the second fiscal quarter. Let me now turn the call over to Priscilla for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jud Bailey","Thanks, good morning. My first question, I think as Mark wanted to follow-up on -- some of your comments on operating cost per day, I think you indicated, you still expect to -- I think ultimately get to kind of the normalized level of around 13,700, is that a level that we should anticipate, or can start to think about for the September or the December quarter, is -- do you have a line of sight that's something that makes sense based on the slowdown in reactivation super-spec upgrades?","John Lindsay","Well, thanks for the call and question. As we look at it, there is a breakdown currently of about $400 per day for upfront reactivation expenses. So, I would assume, Jud that is the part that you can start actively modeling downward to mere slower cadence. However, we still have about $330 per day, related to the inactive rig count that we have idled as well as the calls to idle rigs that we've experienced recently. So, that bucket is a little bit harder to determine a direct line of sight to you.","Jud Bailey","Okay, all right. Well, that's helpful though. My follow-up I think is for John. Could you maybe talk little more about AutoSlide and now that you're commercializing it, maybe talk a little bit about what you're hearing from customers and how quickly that the rollout maybe there and how quickly you think you may get more systems out in the field?","John Lindsay","Okay, Jud, it's very hard at this stage to judge the speed of the rollout as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks. We have a design in terms of rolling it out to various basins, and we started with Midland, and we're going -- we're in the Eagle Ford now as we said, and then in a couple of months, our intent is to deploy into the Scoop Stack play, but our intent is to have AutoSlide in all of the basins. And so, as you think about what we're doing in the automation phase, we're actually using machine learning and the Motive algorithm and the FlexRig operating system. So these -- you know, the great news is these algorithms continue to learn and learn the basin, kind of the specific differences and\/or challenges that each basin may provide. And so, again, there will be more to come on it. We're working for four customers now, three in Midland, and one in the Eagle Ford. And again, we're excited about the performance thus far, and again, this is the automation of the sliding function when drilling a horizontal well. So, that's kind of the overview.","Jud Bailey","Okay, all right. Well, I'll turn it back, thanks. Thanks a lot.","John Lindsay","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question today from Tommy Moll with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Tommy Moll","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.","John Lindsay","Good morning, Tommy.","Tommy Moll","I wanted to follow-up with one AutoSlide question, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, a comparison to $2,000 a day for directional driller. How should we think about being able to capture the full value that you're going to deliver to customers with AutoSlide, and as a day rate framework the right way for us to think about it, or is there an alternative strategy to go to market here with AutoSlide?","John Lindsay","Yes, I think, Tommy, we're definitely not -- we're definitely not looking at a commercialization model that's based on a day rate. Mark was simply using that as just kind of an idea of part of the value proposition that a customer can see right off the bat, because AutoSlide does allow for the elimination of the of the directional drillers on the rig side. Now, we have directional drillers that are off-site that are watching the wells real-time, but it enables you -- as you think about some of the industry themes over the last two, three years, and one is automation, one is more of a demanding being less reliant on having as many people on rig side. And so, I think it's one of those steps that allow that to happen. Part of the process of the rollout AutoSlide and other reason for taking maybe taking a little slower than what we would normally take it, one of the things that's important is to understand the value proposition, and if you go back to the early days of the FlexRig, of course we were building -- we started off of building two rigs a month with the first luxury that we rolled out, but there was definitely an adoption phase, and our industry has a tendency to adopt kind of at a slower pace. But again as you think about major themes that we've seen as an industry over the last couple of years, there's definitely a desire and need to utilize digital technology, to utilize higher levels of technology, and looking at demanding. So that's really the opportunity.","So we have to jointly work on this value proposition with the customer. Again, there's the automation piece, but there's also the tortuosity, less tortuosity, which delivers on things like better downhole tool life. It require -- it allows downhole tools to last longer, which means we're tripping fewer times, which means we're lowering risk at the rig site. And then again, I'd mentioned in my remarks that I mean there are some industry studies out there that are saying that less tortuous wellbore has the potential for higher oil production. So those are big deals and every customer is going to be different every situation is going to be different. So that's kind of the outlier. It's all about us figuring out ways to deliver higher levels of value for our customers. And of course we're making significant investments not only dollar wise, but management time structure standing up H&P technologies, all those sorts of things are I think are very important in the success of the product. So, again all about customer value and I think when the customers see the value, which we've seen a lot of this point we think they're going to be in a position to want to pay paper that perform.","Tommy Moll","Thank you, John. That's all helpful. And as a follow-up, I wanted to switch gears and talk about the international opportunity you called out the LOI to send a super-spec to Argentina, can you give us anything there, just in terms of the back story, how long conversations have been going on. Anything anecdotally you could share given this is a pretty important update to have your first deployment internationally. And then going forward, how big of an opportunity do you see, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, it did not only involves the rig but also technology potentially over time. So, whether you answer that specific to Argentina more just generally about the opportunity to export some of your capability, it would be helpful. Thanks.","John Lindsay","Sure, thanks, Tom. Well, on the super-spec again as a reminder, we've I think 12 or 13 flex threes in Argentina now and they aren't super-spec, they have not been upgraded to super spec, again one of the one of the advantages that we have is the ability to upgrade those super specs. So this is the first fully upgraded super-spec rig coming out of FlexRig this going down to Argentina. Again, it's a great opportunity; it's something we've been working on for I don't even know the timing, probably over the last couple of months. I think there is additional opportunity for us to send more of FlexRig super-spec capacity that's in the U.S. to Argentina specifically and also into other countries over time. And then obviously there's the opportunity to upgrade existing rigs on the ground, super-spec capacity. So I think that's a great, great position for us, it's depending on what the market does here in the U.S. we've got additional opportunities outside of the U.S. As far as H&P technologies, specifically Motive and MagVar both of those technologies are applicable to international markets, both on FlexRigs, as we've said, as well as on other rigs that our customers are contracting.","And I think there's a lot of interest associated with both and so I would expect in the coming quarters that we will be able to talk more about that and be able to demonstrate some of the traction, some of the adoption that we've seen with these other technologies. You know, we've -- I think we've made mentioned in the past that, there's always the opportunity to have the technology pull the rig through as a one potential, but definitely there is interest both in the Middle East and in South America for our technology offerings.","Tommy Moll","Thank you, John. That's all for me.","John Lindsay","All right, Tommy. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question today from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Scott Gruber","Yes, good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gruber","Good morning. A question on the extra costs in U.S. Land, just a ballpark, what is the cost to either a rig relative to the cost to reactivate, I know it will differ on a rig-by-rig basis but kind of ballpark, what is the delta between those two?","John Lindsay","Well, I think, I might have mentioned in my prepared remarks that the reactivation calls can be about oh, from an OpEx perspective, about a $1 million to $1.5 million is really going to depend on that particular rig. The idling cost is substantially less than that. So that's why the range of those buckets for reactivation costs or versus idling costs have delta. So we will again see regression of other activation costs through time that will mirror the slowdown in the cadence of upgrades. The idling cost shake them off a little bit in that bucket just because we are seeing here early in the third quarter, the leveling of the fleet count, but we will continue to incur the static idling cost for rigs that are long been inactive.","Scott, I've a little bit more color on that as well. I guess just so we're clear that those reactivation costs that Mark mentioned are related to rigs that have been idle for a very long period of time. If you look at the reactivation of the most recently idled rigs, those reactivation costs are very, very low. And in fact, even the idling expense is very low because as compared to what we saw in 14 and 15, 16 timeframe, when we were idling the rigs then, we took great care to do a lot because we realized those rigs weren't going to go back to work and in a couple of weeks or a couple of months, so the rigs that that we idled recently, we fully believe we're going to go back to work and in near term, in fact, a lot of them have, you know, we continue to have this ongoing churn, which is common, even in the strongest of markets. The churn level is higher today, obviously than it was say, four or five months ago, but we still have rigs that are idled recently, a lot of those, some of those have gone back to work. It's just a continual churn. So I just wanted to make certain that you recognize with the most recently idled rigs to reactivate is a very, very low cost.","Scott Gruber","I appreciate the color. And then I think Mark you called out $330 a day of costs for the inactive rigs. So if we're just caught flat on the rig count and everything normalizes, should we be taking closer to 14k as the normal daily rate cost of 37 plus the three in change?","Mark Smith","It'll be a little less than that Scott, because the 330 is a combination of the inactive legacy fleet, if you will, and the cost to idle rigs that have recently been idle. And as those costs of let's say 200 or so thousand per day when we've been idling rigs in this calendar year that will come off with this moderation that we've experienced. So, we always, we always see some churn but the it'll -- it is going to be reducing, but they -- you know, it's going to what the ultimate number is just going to be, it's going to be up to the market.","Scott Gruber","Okay. And then one on CapEx, I appreciate the additional color on where your maintenance stands getting your current activity set. In the second half the year, it looks like you'll spend $180 million, $190 million, or about 90-95 per quarter. Again, ballpark, is that a good run rate to think about for fiscal 20 assuming no major swings in rig count, or would it be lower than that? Given your maintenance level expense?","Mark Smith","I think it would be lower than that. If you think about the three buckets I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you just assume that we were in as a planning proxy again, flat rig count next year and you eliminated the upgrade bucket for this illustrative example, you also would essentially remove the bulk catch-up bucket as well. So, long way to say, you get down to just the regular maintenance on the active rig count. And that is really how if -- that's really how I think about modeling the next year.","Scott Gruber","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","John Lindsay","You are welcome.","Mark Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question today from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open.","Kurt Hallead","Thank you. Good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","It is a great summary. I appreciate all the color commentary and insights. So I think John, what I think I'd like to maybe focus on a bit is the dynamics around the new technology, the photo slide, the applications and algorithms and the new business model and just want to be clear, as well on that dynamic. So the new segment you have is a technology segment. So first and foremost, all the AutoSlide and algorithms and apps and everything else, that's going to be housed within that new technology segment. And I say that mainly because you're going to differentiate the revenue generation for that business vis-\u00e0-vis just adding a day rate for that. Am I understanding that correctly, like all that technology driven business will be in that specific segment, it's not going to be layered into a day rate?","John Lindsay","Kurt, on the FlexApps, an IDC resin and HPT segment, but they are not -- they work type applications. We're not pricing those and generally in that sort of a fashion, we're generally pricing them in a different type of a business model. The rest of the AutoSlide and Motive and MagVar, those are HPT. In our industry, it's hard to -- it's been hard to not go down the day rate model. I think it's something that's kind of a legacy piece. And again, our effort is to develop different sorts of pricing models. We've been successful in doing that in some cases and other cases; it is a -- more of a day work type or performance type of model if you, so that's the separation.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, that's helpful. So you spoke about working with the customer base in defining and understanding the value proposition of what AutoSlide and the FlexApps are going to bring to the table. Obviously, this is a discussion that you guys should be very comfortable with ever since the advent of the HP FlexRigs into the marketplace, you've been able to demonstrate that value prop. How do you find these discussions going with the customer base and kind of what have you been learning as you've been having these discussions around how the E&Ps kind of view this new technology dynamic?","John Lindsay","I think, for the most part, our customers have been very embracing. I mean, I think, using an example of we've got I think MagVar is on close to 300 rigs today and close to a 100 for -- on H&P. Motive is still just still under 30 rigs. But the Motive challenges are much different than the MagVar as an example. But I think in general, they've been very embracing. It's not a question of, if the technology works or if the technology adds value. It's -- there's a certain element of change management that is always a challenge when you're introducing new technologies, regardless of the industry.","And again, our industry has some of those challenges, but in general, I think they're very embracing. We have a lot of, a lot of interest, particularly on automation and being able to drive another level of reliability for customers, as I said in my remarks, it is -- it's not effective enough today to only drill a very fast well. There're other elements of that, and as there's reliability, and there's less tortuosity, and there's better, better placement. And so, I think that's really, really important.","Kurt Hallead","And it's good, it's great. And a follow-up, we talk about maybe the super-spec rig dynamics. I know, you guys always provide pretty good information around, what you think the market size is and how many rigs are out there that are currently super-spec capability? How many rigs could potentially be upgraded? Can you give us a quick snapshot on that again?","John Lindsay","I think if you use our strictest definition that we've utilized, I think there's around 520 super-spec rigs at with another 150 using that strictest definition that could be upgraded. And I think maybe half of those are actually working today. And then if you expand the definition, and if you look at again, what we said overtime is, look at what rigs are actually working and what their size might be. There are some either larger hookload or a larger horsepower drawworks that have -- that have been outfitted to some of the super-spec capacity. And I think that's another 100 and maybe 120 rigs or so that are active in the market today. And so that gives you what a 650 or so that are active. I think it's also important when we have this conversation that we also mentioned that there's still about 230 legacy rigs, mostly SCR but even some mechanical rigs that have been upgraded in some capacity or another to do some of this more challenging horizontal work. And those rigs are out there working today, obviously, much fewer SCR rigs working today than what you saw in 2014.","There's -- I don't know what the right number is, probably seven or 600 or 700 rigs that are that are gone. So I think there's a real opportunity to deliver a much higher level of value proposition to customers and disk and continue to disrupt that legacy rig fleet business. And, I fully expect that that's going to that's going to continue to happen over the coming years. And particularly, I think in an environment like we see today, where customers aren't growing their fleets in a large scale way. They're looking at their rigs. And they're looking at them very closely quarterly, having quarterly performance reviews and determining who is performing and who is not. And in those situations, I think you'll find where the AC drive and specifically FlexRigs, you're going to take some additional market share.","Mark Smith","And just to add to that John, as we said earlier, we have 230 super-spec rigs ourselves here at H&P. And currently we have another 47 that are available for upgrade, eight of those are working. So we still have -- certainly still have added capacity within our fleet.","Kurt Hallead","All right, that's awesome. Thanks for that info. I appreciate it.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Kurt.","John Lindsay","Thanks, Kurt.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next today to Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Sean Meakim","Thank you. Good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Meakim","I was hoping, you could just maybe clarify the cadence of upgrades for fiscal 19, just make sure we have the number straight. I think that we have 14 that were completed in fiscal 1Q, I think nine in the second quarter, and I think the release talks about two or three more, in the current quarter earlier in your comments, may be you said there five more for the year. So I wanted to make sure that the five may be the two or three probably inclusive of the five? So something we're talking about something like 28 rigs. I think the budget is set around $180 million to maybe 6.5 million prior that seems to kind of foot with your prior guidance of walking versus skid system that all seems at the foot properly?","Mark Smith","Sean, yes, it does your math - is your math is spot on.","Sean Meakim","All right, it's not always the case. So I appreciate that. And then just on international is to get a bit more of a clarification. Could you maybe give us a little more detail, what's driving the lower active international rig count quarter-over-quarter and the margin compression is it more as it is, as rig moves there maybe some mix shift within the rigs that are working get more understanding there, if we can.","Mark Smith","In the call in January, we had provided some guidance that we expected the Colombia market to contract a bit, we really see that market more directly correlating to oil price movements for this quarter. Upcoming that we're giving guidance for it, we do not see any revisions back even with the oil price trajectory that we've seen recently, but stay tuned.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Okay, fair enough. One last piece of the international, we talked a good bit about the Argentina contract in the flux going to rain, how do you think about the rest of the world ex Argentina appetite for incremental rigs that can be deployed internationally and then long term the appetite for super-spec rigs and some of these other markets?","Mark Smith","We'll - others make an introductory comment or two year as it relates to the unconventional play as we've talked about in John's specifically talked about on previous calls, we've had tremendous success in Argentina that mirrors the success we've had in the U.S. land we certainly aim to be a part of that continuing story there and next, we really look for unconventional to move to the Arabian Peninsula. So several different countries in the Middle East and I think in the January call we even mentioned that some of the inbound inquiries we've had there, and those are -- those inquiries for AC rigs in particular just exemplary of that flex 4 LOI that we have in brain that we've just done this week. But in Argentina, the super-spec going there first super-spec to deploy internationally is really exciting, because it talks about how the unconventional play in the block and mortar is actually getting more complex and laterals are getting longer. So the need for the super-spec will come into play more through the development of this field.","John Lindsay","Yes, I would just add, Sean. And of course we've seen this as an opportunity for a long time and we've preface it by saying when we see unconventionals more horizontal wells internationally and when you get to the point where there's a need for more of a manufacturing type process then H&P as the rigs in the capacity and the solution really to deliver in that situation. So really - that's really I think what has to happen is we've got to see those types of programs developed like what we've seen in Argentina and I think that begins to open up the opportunities for us.","Sean Meakim","Sure that all make sense. Thank you, both. I appreciate it.","John Lindsay","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next today to Brad Handler with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brad Handler","Hi, thanks guys for squeezing me in. I guess I'm just have one question related to Argentina and it's more just you can help us think about things aren't as good in Argentina as they were very recently right inflation is clearly creeping up as a risk in the IMF, it sounds like it's going to get involved and whatever, how can you help us think about risks as it relates to your business. I think your contracts are all dollar-denominated. So, that's good, but what about just labor disruption or other factors that we may have to think about if Argentina and unfortunately goes the wrong way.","Mark Smith","I'll start of, Brad. As it relates to the contracts are corrected there. The contracts are tied to the U.S. dollar, technically paid in pesos. But in literally there is a same day and billing and payment, so we can convert right back to U.S. dollars. From a revenue perspective, the US dollar and the way to think about it from in country cost perspective. We have a mix that we have several of our inputs pieces of equipment, et cetera, that will have some U.S. dollar denomination. We also have some component of expat personnel, which are tied to the U.S. dollar and then locally cost of the expenses are in the peso and offset each other. So that is kind of the high level, we have. So, in other words, we have been pretty well shielded from the hyperinflationary position there and H&P and continue to work to look to keep that state. As it relates to the labor market, I'll let John comment.","John Lindsay","Yes, Brad. We, there are challenges at times with the labor unions in Argentina, but our experience in [indiscernible] have been very positive. I think particularly as compared to other areas that we've worked in Argentina in that further south, I think in general though it kind of comes back to this general overarching theme that you've heard us come back to many, many times and that is working internationally has a whole another level of challenges and risks that we at least up to this point in time. Haven't faced in the U.S. one of the reasons why we've grown our fleet in the way that we haven't made the investments that we've made in US land and we haven't been able to grow as much internationally, and it's because we haven't been able to get term contracts you can't make the returns that you would really like to make because of the risk associated with it. So it's one of the things that we've come to used to and yes, there's a lot of questions in Argentina, the upcoming election is obviously is one and we'll see how that turns out.","Brad Handler","Okay, fair enough. Yes, I guess I think I said I will turn it back. Thank you.","Mark Smith","Okay, thanks, Brad.","Operator","One moment please. All right, and this does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'll turn the call back to John Lindsay for any closing remarks.","John Lindsay","Okay, well, thank you. I appreciate everyone's attendance today and being interested in H&P again thanks to all of our employees that work hard every day to contribute to the H&P ways. So, thank you very much. Have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's program.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call will be recorded. [Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Helmerich & Payne's Conference Call and Webcast corresponding to the first quarter of fiscal 2012. With us today are Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO; and John Lindsay, Executive Vice President and COO.","As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call to Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO. And after Hans, John Lindsay and I will make additional comments, and we'll then open the call for questions.","Hans Helmerich","Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone. As the company continues to grow, we hit 3 notable milestones for our most recent quarter. We recorded our all-time record level of income from continuing operations. We also reached our best-ever levels for revenue and rig activity for the last quarter.","On this call, we will detail some of the drivers that enabled this performance and walk through some of our expectations going forward into 2012, including some moderation in the second quarter as daily expenses returned to more expected levels from this quarter's significantly reduced number.","Before that discussion, let me comment for a moment just on the dire state of the natural gas market. Prices are plummeting. We see storage overflowing and an ample behind of pipe supply, so the question becomes how much downward pressure may this bring to bear upon the domestic land drilling market?","Clearly, a combination of these factors in previous cycles would have resulted in a predictable drop of the rig count. In fact, for decades, natural gas pricing was the single most important barometer for the overall rig count. Today, oil and liquids-rich gas have transformed the domestic drilling landscape. Oil-directed drilling has been on a steady march up, while dry gas drilling has lost ground.","And while the gas-directed count will even now most likely accelerate its decline trend, many expect any fall out to be partially or fully offset by displaced rigs being redirected to oil and liquids-rich targets. This transition that has been underway since the summer of 2008 and may well become more pronounced and impactful. It has been combined with the transition towards more complex well design and higher performance rig requirements. ","We would expect higher-performing Tier 1 AC drive rigs will be best positioned to make the transition while older underperforming rigs will be more likely to be less sidelined, unable to secure the customer sponsorship to be mobilized and recast for other work. It has become type of a zero-sum game where oil and liquids-rich gas continues to gain over dry gas and where high-efficiency rigs continue to displace mechanical and SCR rigs.","We're fortunate to have a customer roster with substantial multiyear drilling inventory capable of shifting targets and taking advantage of strong oil prices. Also, we're well-positioned with the most modern and capable fleet in the industry and by having that historically small exposure in terms of rigs focused on dry gas. Less than 10% of our total active U.S. fleet is currently engaged in dry gas directed drilling on the spot market. Additional dry gas directed rigs are under term contracts. And we would anticipate some of those to transition to oil and liquids-rich targets over time as well.","We've been asked if some demand for new builds will be satisfied by higher-end dislocated rigs during 2012. Our focus will remain the same, because we are coming off such a robust order book from 2011 that totaled 71 fully contracted new builds. We continue to deliver 4 rigs each month on time and on budget. We have 40 orders remaining in the queue, approximately 30 to complete in fiscal 2012 and 10 slotted for 2013.","Some of our peers continue to have significant numbers of their announced 2012 new build programs without contracts. We would expect to see some of those deliveries delayed, and one would think their appetite for additional spec new builds would be suppressed. In the meantime, we are solving more for 2013 as we have all but 7 slots fully contracted and spoken for in calendar 2012. Notwithstanding the added uncertainty of depressed natural gas prices, we remain upbeat that our business model of delivering premium drilling services will remain a strong demand and provide us with attractive opportunities in 2012 and beyond.","Before closing, let me mention that this is my first call as Chairman, having assumed that title with Dad's passing 3 weeks ago. Lots of nice things have already been written and said about him, so I won't do that here. Having worked together for 30 years, I do remember he would say there are more important things than quarterly earnings. Think more about the kind of company you want to build in the long term. And while he loved business and was a part of this company for 60 years, he would say there are more important things than being the best businessperson around. So especially for the younger analysts and investors on this call, let me pass on his encouragement to us to be folks of strong character, good parents, to make an impact on our churches and communities.","So in his memory, I'll share those thoughts for all of us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported $144 million in income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, representing an increase of almost 20% as compared to the immediately preceding quarter. This very significant increase was mainly attributable to our U.S. land segment, where we experienced continuing improvement in pricing and activity levels and a very favorable reduction in daily rig expenses. As Hans mentioned, our U.S. land daily rig expenses are expected to return to a normalized level during the second quarter. Nevertheless, we do expect continuing overall growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the second fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of an increasing number of FlexRigs in our U.S. land segment.","Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion. Our depreciation and our general and administrative expense estimates for the year also remain at approximately $380 million and $105 million, respectively. Interest expense after capitalized interest is now expected to decrease to approximately $13 million during fiscal 2012, and our tax rate for continuing operations during the year is expected to be approximately 37%.","I will now turn the call to John Lindsay. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. My comments will be on the operational results for our first fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international, as well as the outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2012. And I'll begin with our U.S. land segment first fiscal quarter results, where U.S. land operating income increased 17% sequentially to $225 million as the U.S. land segment took delivery of 11 new build FlexRigs during the first fiscal quarter.","Revenue days increased 5% to 20,968 days, representing 228 average active rigs in the first quarter. An average of 145 rigs were active under term contracts and an average of 83 rigs were active in the stock market.","Average rig revenue per day increased by $312 to $26,861 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 5% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Average rig expenses per day decreased by $643 to $12,292 per day, primarily as a result of what we believe were only temporary reductions in maintenance and supply costs. Consequently, average rig margin per day increased by $955 to $14,569 per day. ","The outlook for U.S. land during the fiscal quarter remains positive. H&P remains the most active U.S. land contractor as we have 236 contracted rigs today and 23 idle rigs, a 91% utilization rate. Of these 236 rigs, 152 are under term contracts and 84 are in the spot market, including 82 FlexRigs. Of the rigs in the spot market, 63 are drilling in areas that typically target oil and\/or liquid-rich gas.","In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2% to 3%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 152 rigs are under term contracts for the second fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 148 rigs for the last 3 quarters of fiscal year '12 and an average of 121 rigs for fiscal year 2013.","Average rig revenue per day in the second quarter may improve slightly up to $200 per day, excluding expenses that are passed through to customers. While average rig expense per day quarter-to-quarter is difficult to predict, we expect the base level of average rig expense per day to return to a $12,700 a day range, similar to previous quarters, excluding any expense increases that would be passed through to customers. We do expect wages to increase during the second quarter in a range of approximately $500 per day.","Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget. Including the 3 additional new FlexRigs announced today, during the past 13 months, we've announced signed term contracts to build and operate a total of 74 new FlexRigs. And currently, 40 remain under construction and are being completed at the rate of approximately 4 rigs per month. The 3 newly contracted rigs are expected to be utilized in the Eagle Ford Shale, the Bakken Shale and the Permian Basin, and all 3 are FlexRig3s.","Of the 40 remaining under construction, approximately 30 are expected to be delivered in fiscal year '12 and 10 in fiscal '13. Considering a cadence of 4 rigs per month, 7 additional delivery slots remain in our calendar year '12 schedule.","A quick review of our new build success of delivering FlexRigs on time with safe and efficient operations. One year ago, we had 198 rigs operating in U.S. land and we announced our new build cadence was increasing to 3 rigs per month beginning in January of '11. And we successfully delivered 3 rigs per month, from January through September, plus we increased our cadence to 4 rigs per month beginning in October. As of today, we've delivered a total of 40 new FlexRigs since our conference call on 27 January of 2011. In addition to our rig construction group delivering rigs on time, we are also proud that the H&P rig leadership and crews on the 40 newly commissioned FlexRigs were able to deliver safety performance during the first year of operation at a rate approximately 2x better than the industry average.","Now we'll talk about the offshore segment, and our operating income increased slightly to $12.2 million. Revenue days decreased 1% sequentially to 697 days. Average rig margin per day increased by $388 to $22,171 per day.","Outlook for offshore. As of today, the company's offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs stacked, although our rig in Trinidad is returning to the U.S. and is expected to stack at the end of the second fiscal quarter. In the second fiscal quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to decrease by approximately 10% and expect average daily margins to decrease by 10% to 15% as some rigs transition between projects.","And now I'll turn to the international segment, where international land continues to show improvements quarter-to-quarter. Operating income increased by approximately $4.4 million sequentially to $7.9 million during the first quarter. Revenue days increased 6% to 1,729 days. Average rig margin per day increased by $1,325 to $9,015 a day. The primary factor driving the increase in average rig margin per day was a $1.6 million retroactive one-off day rate adjustment. And on the last call, we discussed moving 2 stacked conventional rigs to access markets with higher potential work prospects, and we expected those to occur during the first fiscal quarter. However, now those rig moves are occurring in the second quarter, and today, both rigs have contracts.","Outlook for international. As of today, the company's International segment has 20 active rigs and an additional 2 rigs contracted and in transit between countries. Six rigs are active or contracted in Colombia, 5 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Of the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia. In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect international land revenue days to be sequentially flat as 1 rig became idle in Colombia and the 2 rigs currently in-transit will not have a significant effect on revenue days until the third or fourth fiscal quarters. Given the absence of the $1.6 million retroactive adjustment payment and the recent stacking of one rig in Colombia, we expect the average rig margin per day to sequentially fall by 10% to 15%.","One highlight I would like to point out regarding the international segment; included in today's 20-rig active fleet is the first FlexRig3 contracted and active in Colombia. You heard us talk previously about the impressive FlexRig4 performance in Argentina and Colombia, and this contract is a result of that exceptional performance. As you may recall, the FlexRig3 is designed to exploit deeper wells than the Flex 4 while maintaining fast rig moves and is well-suited for the majority of wells that we're going to be seeing internationally.","We believe the international market in general appears to be improving for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East as a result of H&P's performance in safety, drilling and rig moves. In each of these regions, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice what each conventional rig previously was able to provide.","So in closing, we believe the current trends are advantageous to H&P where unconventional oil and liquid-rich plays have proven to be a game changer in the U.S. land market as operators shift to drilling more complex horizontal and directional wells. This drilling complexity factor presents real challenges for old conventional rigs and lower technology product offerings.","An example of this change was commented on during our last earnings call, an industry trend where we expected several years ago may have reached the tipping point whereby legacy mechanical rigs are being retired at a higher rate than in previous cycles. Another data point to keep in mind, as well complexity increases and natural gas prices soften, our 3 largest public competitors' active fleets rely heavily on their old conventional fleets to maintain their current activity levels.","The competitors' fleet composition of active mechanical and SCR rigs ranges from 50% to 75%. In a very strong market where both oil and natural gas pricing is high, the old conventional rig fleet is at a lower risk of being stacked. But in a sub-$3 gas price environment, when dry gas drilling is losing favor, the bottom-tier-performing mechanical and SCR rigs are more likely going to be stacked and are less likely \u2013 a less likely candidate to be redirected and mobilized to oil and liquid-rich basins.","H&P, on the other hand, no longer operates our markets mechanical rigs, and less than 10% of our active U.S. land fleet today is made-up of SCR rigs. The rest of H&P's active fleet in U.S. land, over 90% of it, is made up of AC drive advanced technology FlexRigs. These market trends, along with encouraging conversations with customers for additional new builds, provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. ","And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. And Alicia, we will now open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from William Conroy of Pritchard Capital.","William Cornelius Conroy - Pritchard Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Really, John, just wanted to ask about the last point you made which was the potential for additional new build opportunities and ask you to just flush that out a little bit. How do you see that playing out in light of what looks like the near-term environment? And can you maybe just give us a little bit more color on the level of interest or the market for additional new builds, maybe not in the next -- during the current fiscal year but as we get into next fiscal year?","John W. Lindsay","Sure, William. Right now, we're probably 8 or 9 months out as far as our next new build delivery slot that would be available. We have quite a few conversations still ongoing with customers regarding some of those new build slots. Most of those conversations are in the calendar year 2012. Occasionally, we'll have some discussions regarding 2013. I really think what's driving it is much of what Hans and I tried to portray, which is the complexity of wells and how those wells are changing over time. And especially now, with some softness in dry gas basins, you're seeing rigs being redirected quite often. And in a lot of cases, on the lower-end rigs, I think what we're seeing is a lot of those rigs are getting stacked because they're not getting moved because of the costs associated with moving them as well as just the overall performance. So we believe that if you look at the overall market in terms of available AC drive rigs, we think there's opportunities to continue to add. And again, I think the biggest challenge right now is that we're about 8 or 9 months out.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Daniel with Simmons & Company.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Just really one for me this morning. I understand the theory about the new rigs displacing the old rigs, but I would assume that some of those old rigs don\u2019t want to go quietly. And so at this point, have you seen any price discounting by your peers? And if not, at what point do you expect the price discounting to begin, and then how would that influence your pricing strategy?","Hans Helmerich","This is Hans. And I don't think we're seeing that yet in full force. But if you go back coming off of last downturn, what developed is a pretty clear bifurcation in the marketplace and there was discounting, as you inferred, from those lower-performing rigs. So we would expect that, that could happen and they won't go quietly. We've seen, again coming off of that downturn, the higher-performing rigs get taken up quickly and the activity has been very strong across-the-board, not just with our tier 1 rigs but with our peers. And so kind of to the first question and to your question as well, I think that there'll be a transition time and the market will absorb some of those. I mean, we've just come off -- I wouldn't read too much into our 3-rig announcement. We've just come off the holidays and kind of the turmoil around gas prices, and I think the market will take a certain amount of time to settle down. But I don\u2019t think the longer-term trends towards a replacement cycle really get pushed to the side. I think that's something that continues to run going forward.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. But is it safe for me to assume then, Hans, that as you look at the market today, that it's reasonable to assume that as we get towards the back half of the year, all else being equal, that pricing begins to trend lower?","Hans Helmerich","Well, I guess I'm a strong believer in the segmentation of the business and that we've seen it. There was some question going into this last recovery in '10 and '11, would there really be a differentiation and a segmentation? And in fact, there has been and you've seen the pricing related to that. So the notion that there's this drag effect, I think that may happen just on the margin because I really think the customer is determined to have the right equipment matched with his development and exploitation challenges. And I just think that the segmentation becomes very clear and it won't have the contamination or contagion that you might expect.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Waqar, we can't hear you. Are you there?","[Technical Difficulty]","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry about that. Just first question, do you have any guidance on deferred taxes? Were taxes deferred in the quarter and what do you think for the remainder of the year?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Waqar, that's a good question. This is Juan Pablo. We had approximately $187 million of deferred income taxes in fiscal 2011. And our best guess at this point is that we have a similar amount during the year distributed throughout the 4 quarters, perhaps the first quarter, may be a little higher than the other ones. But it's hard to tell by how much.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And secondly, Hans, do you see any cancellations of contracts that we saw previously? Do you fear that, that could happen, or is there any talk on that? As these companies lay off their dry gas rigs, I know that they have some of your high-end rigs under term contracts there.","Hans Helmerich","Waqar, I think what we're seeing is a much more orderly and smooth transition in this market going forward than what we all lived through from the fall of '08 into early '09. And I think that was more related to the financial crisis and a boardroom decision of wanting to make sure companies preserve their liquidity and just trying to create links to secure that. So I think this is more of a normal orderly process. And it's why, I mentioned to John, I don\u2019t think it will have a huge drag going forward on pricing. And again, we're hoping that -- we've really been in this transition since the gas-directed rig count peaked in July of 2008. So I think companies look at it in a fresh way, trying to project gas prices and then the combination of things. But as we mentioned, we're encouraged by just the sheer inventory level, especially the customers represented in our customer roster have to redirect towards oil and gas liquids-rich drilling. So that's where I think some of the order comes in and the smoothness in the transition.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. You've mentioned \u2013 you\u2019ve probably mentioned before as well, and I was kind of -- I joined in late, but would you say about 30% of your rigs are currently working into basically just the dry gas plays, is that right?","Hans Helmerich","Well, it's actually -- what we tried to talk about is on the spot market, we have 20, 21 rigs in that category. So it really represents 10% of what our active spot market rigs are doing. Then we have additional rigs that are under term contract. And we're seeing now the customer, again, in kind of an orderly way, is making the decision whether or not to redirect that rig. So I'm glad you asked because I think it's an important point that in the spot market, just 10% of our rigs are directed towards dry gas.","John W. Lindsay","Waqar, this is John. Another example. If you look at the Haynesville, I think at our peak, we had 28 rigs working in the Haynesville. Today, we're down to 5 or 6. But all of those rigs and most of those 28 were on term contracts. And those rigs have all been moved to either the Eagle Ford, the Permian or the Cana Woodford. None of those rigs were stacked. I mean, essentially the customers were using the best rigs in the basin they can make the most money with. And so I think that's what we're going to -- as Hans alluded to, I think that's what we're going to continue to see is the best rigs being mobilized to the basins where the economics are the best.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So one other question just on a big picture. When we look at the rig count in the U.S., by our estimates, about 70% of all drilling right now, if not more, is on oil and liquids-rich. And there is very little limited dry gas drilling going on and only in maybe the Haynesville. Notice Marcellus, there is some rigs, in any meaningful way, that are drilling for dry gas. Rest of the places like the Barnett, Fayetteville and others, there are very few rigs that are drilling. And so even if you cut them by 50%, the impact is not that huge on the overall rig count. Do you see it that way as well? Or...","John W. Lindsay","I think so. Yes, I think that's what we'll see, Waqar. You're right, the numbers aren't big. Although the Haynesville, I don\u2019t know what the latest is in Haynesville, but that's still a pretty active basin. But I think a lot of those rigs will continue to migrate out.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So we had 180 at its peak, now it's down to maybe 90 rigs. So even if you have like a 50% reduction it's another, maybe 40, 50 rigs to go. And is that kind of fair?","Hans Helmerich","Yes. And Waqar, this is Hans again. I think you're making our point that we've already seen a lot of the transition take place. And what is remaining in the queue, we're just in a very good position with the quality of our fleet to continue to make the transition and it be less disruptive.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Gruber with Bernstein Research.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Hans, you've discussed the outlook for additional FlexRig orders in the U.S. But with interest in some shale development programs progressing now down in Latin America, we do have established positions. Is there a potential for international FlexRig orders to begin complementing domestic orders possibly later this year? Or is that still off the horizon?","Hans Helmerich","Well, I think the answer is we hope to see and I think we will see and we're having conversations with customers about adding to our FlexRigs into the international part of our fleet. And then it gets back, Scott, to exactly what you're kind of focused on, is that an end of 2012 event or '13 event. And our thought is it's a '13 event. But tough to predict. I said recently that we have seen less focus and interest from our customers recently than we had 6 or 9 months ago. But I think coming off of the holidays, we're starting to have some additional conversations and talks. So that kind of ebbs and flows. But I think you should focus more on it being impactful later in '13 than later in '12.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, so that would be a 2013 delivery of equipment or 2013 placement of the orders for FlexRigs?","Hans Helmerich","Well, we don't have anything really to tell you or announce in terms of rig orders being placed. And we're pretty disciplined around not doing that until we have signed contracts. But I do think that the interest level is there from customers. And you've heard us say before that part of what we're hoping to lever off is the satisfied group of customers in our roster that wants to take us into -- and the whole service complement that they've been successful with here domestically, take that into international markets. And so we would expect that to occur.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brad Handler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions, please, around your cost guidance, just want to make sure I understood it. It sounds -- you mentioned a $500 a day labor increase. Is that fully implemented in the second fiscal quarter?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, Brad. It will be fully implemented in the second quarter.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so there's $500 a day on average. I think you mentioned $12,700 a day average expense per day guidance, is that right?","John W. Lindsay","Well, the $12,700, Brad, is really a reference to a more normalized cost like what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And as we said, it's hard to nail the number right now, but that's kind of the range that we're thinking. But we spent -- every quarter, we spend a lot of time and effort on trying to work on costs and controlling costs and working on a lot of different systems and processes. And this quarter turned out very, very nicely. We'd love to see the next quarter turn out nicely. But I think we have to take into account what the -- kind of what average has been, so that's why we're talking that $12,700.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I think I see. I'm just -- if you were at $12,300 and you add for labor, it doesn't sound like you're anticipating any of those lower maintenance or lower supply costs to go away this quarter. In other words, you might be able to keep that lower level of cost. Am I -- I'm just -- I don't want to make too much of numbers that I think maybe you're saying are indicative, but that's -- is that what you're suggesting for us?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Brad, this is Juan Pablo. I think that $12,700 level that was mentioned excluded any increased expenses that would be passed through to customers through increased day rates. And so the $12,700 would be the base, and then the $500, and if there are any other pass-throughs, would be additive to that.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I see. Okay. All right, I think that clarifies it. Great. Second question, unrelated. Maybe just help me understand something a little better. If you have a rig that's on term contract and you mobilize it to a different basin, presumably a liquids-rich basin, what happens to the expenses of that mob [mobilization]?","John W. Lindsay","Brad, this is John. Those expenses are contractually covered by the customer. And so whatever the mob cost is, we're kept whole on that. And likewise, if you were to move from a lower-cost basin to a higher-cost-per-day basin, as it relates to labor and maintenance and supply, we would also have that pass-through as well. So we're kept whole on our margins. But likewise, if you went from a higher cost to a lower-cost basin, then you would also adjust that day rates accordingly.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure. So the individual expense, if there is transition to take place, we might expect reimbursables to go up on the revenue base over, say, the next couple of quarters? Is that reasonable?","John W. Lindsay","Well, that is true. I don't know that it's necessarily true that we're going to have a large movement of rigs. As I mentioned earlier, we've gone from, I believe, 28 rigs in the Haynesville down to 5 or 6. I think we'll continue to have rigs migrate out of basins, but I don't think there are going to be a lot of dollars tied up in it. I don't see a real large number of rigs that\u2019ll take place over the next couple of quarters.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I see, okay. So perhaps adjusting the current rate in the mid to high 50s is maybe a sustainable level for reimbursables? At least as it relates to that issue, I suppose.","John W. Lindsay","I don't really have the details to answer that, Brad.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Wilson with Howard Weil.","David Wilson - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Wanted to revisit a topic here on supply and demand and wondering if you could clarify your thoughts on the topic given the spike coming into the market for 2012 of about 200 rigs, about an equal number of mechanical rigs still working it. And based upon some of the previous questions on day rate levels and where you see those, I mean, to me, it looks like the supply and demand in the near term for the upcoming years is pretty well set and pricing really hasn't moved dramatically one way or another to signal and then balance. But wanted to see if you could provide some clarification there. I know you've mentioned ebbs and flows, but just basically your thoughts on how this could play out. I mean, is it possible that these mechanical rigs continue to work because of the -- they take a discount on the pricing?","Hans Helmerich","Well, yes, and I'm sure you'll see them discount pricing. But I think we have enough history now to show that there'll be a group of customers that still won't find that to be an acceptable fit. And when you mentioned, Dave, the number of new builds coming in, in '12, our guess is it\u2019ll be a little less than that but not enough to quarrel over. But when you look at a fleet the size of the U.S. land fleet and the amount of activity, that to me is not a daunting number. And like John mentioned in his comments, you had 180-plus rigs officially retired last year. And that, in my mind, is not a process that's worked itself out. That needs to continue for years and years to come where you have that amount of attrition or potentially more so. We don't see a big imbalance occurring, and we still see a very strong preference for higher-performing rigs, and the complexity of the well designs and the type of drilling is continuing to increase. And so all of those trends are favorable to our outlook and keep us from being overly concerned with the pricing dynamic.","David Wilson - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up, unrelated, if I could. I was just wondering on the new builds and how much lead time you need in order to get the rigs delivered. In other words, how long is the shelf life on those 7 remaining 2012 spots? I mean, basically, when a customer comes to you and says, \"I want a rig in December 2012,\" what's the latest date you could take that order?","Hans Helmerich","Well, it's a fair question. But I guess it's a little more complicated than that behind the scenes, if you will, in terms of when we have -- we try to accommodate a customer on their preferred delivery, and so it has slots that are open in different times of the year. So maybe a general way of thinking about it is in terms of behind the scenes, our construction process is about a 6-month process. We have some slots available in the fall and then, of course, in '13. I don't know if that's given you the clarification you're asking for.","David Wilson - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","No, Hans, that's good.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Hans or John, you're known as having excellent relationships with the majors. And if you look at some of their build programs over the course of 2011, many have ramped up significantly over the course of the year in terms of numbers of rigs working such as BHP, Marathon, Occi, Shell, Chevron, just to name a few. And I mean, as you look at these companies' rig additions programs, without going into individual customers, but overall, the majors, do you see these companies, certain of them in the midst of major addition programs and the builds we saw these companies do over the past year could be replicated in 2012?","Hans Helmerich","Well, and I'll let John add some thoughts, too. But my first thought is that like you point out, 2011 was a very strong year. We had 71 total new builds which a year ago would have been more than we would've expected. And I think it's important strategically that we got those in place, that they're fully contracted, that they\u2019re in our queue. I think what will happen, Jim, going forward is we're hearing from customers that they have multiyear plans, and as you know, not hundreds but thousands of wells to drill. They're going to migrate to a higher concentration of tier 1 rigs over time. But practically speaking, I think as everyone transitions into the first of the year, they're kind of watching the landscape and taking an account of what's going on in the marketplace. And so in our minds, it's a timing issue and it's not disruptive for the longer term. But in the shorter term, we're probably in a transition period.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But if you -- Hans, if you look at some of these companies and if you look at a Marathon, which is going from 9 to 24 over the past year, or Shell from 14 to 25 or Chevron to 11 from 27, I mean are these the types of companies that could be at 35 to 40 rigs a year from now and they still are in the midst of a significant ramp up? After all, Exxon operates 63 rigs and Occidental is up over 50 as well.","Hans Helmerich","Well, I think as you point out, when you look down our customer list, and we can't speak for our customer except to say they believe their field operations and their ability to execute and their ability to do that on scale and to have the capital structure and the personnel and the expertise and the experience to do all those things would suggest that the rig levels you talked about are not their maximum and that they're capable of doing a lot more. And I think they see it as a strategic strength. So we don't think they're done either, Jim.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Hans, if you were to take that question just a little bit different direction and just look at the international companies, some of which have never really been in the U.S. market to a meaningful extent, number one, do you see some of the international companies that have just gotten in over the past year in the midst of a build? And are you having conversations with large companies that don't have any representation in the U.S. shales? And do you think we could see more new companies, meaning more international companies, entering the U.S. market as they've done in the last year or 2?","Hans Helmerich","Yes, I think that's an important trend and dynamic to watch. And as you know, some of these JV relationships are occurring because these larger NOCs are coming in. And as they gain some of the operations, they will be interested in having the best available solution. And it won't just be H&P, but it\u2019ll be a complement of the folks that -- the service providers that do it the best. And safety is a very keen requirement for them. All those things are accretive to our position. And then I think it just flows into they're over here to gain the experience because they see the international opportunities in their backyards and in other areas of interest that they have. And so I think it would be a natural continuation for that to impact our international footprint as well. So the size, the type of players, their focus on performance, efficiency, safety, all those things are positive for us and I think you'll see it making an impact.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Hill with Tudor, Pickering.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","John, I think you mentioned that you were at 152 term contracts today. And if we look at kind of the progression you guys have talked about in the past, you should see about a drop of maybe 10 over the balance of the year. What do you think the odds are today that you can actually end the year at 152 or better?","John W. Lindsay","The fiscal year?","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, sir.","John W. Lindsay","Yes, I think that's reasonable. I mean, we're giving you a snapshot of current contractual commitments. As you know, as rigs roll off of term, some roll into the spot and some roll back into another term contract. A lot of variables are involved there but I think it's -- I think 150, 152 is reasonable. I think -- we talked about 148 rigs on the last -- average of the last 3 quarters of '12 for the fiscal year. So I think that's a reasonable number.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then this is a little bit more nuanced. But are you seeing any change in the demand for the type of equipment? Given the change we're seeing in activity in the different basins, that is we're losing gas activity and we're picking up oil activity. And I was just wondering whether or not you're seeing more or less demand for, say, scalable equipment?","John W. Lindsay","Joe, I really haven't noticed any difference. The Flex 5 has been popular, the Flex 3 has pad capability although fewer wells on the pad. And we're seeing -- as we've said before, we actually have customers going to pad drilling in areas that don't have the environmental concerns and issues like you would have somewhere in, like in Colorado. So I think it's economics-based. I think it just makes good sense to do that. But I really haven't seen it change much. I mean, we've had nice demand for that and would expect that it would continue.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robin Shoemaker at Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just on that last question, I want to make sure, so you've got about 30 new term rigs on term contract that will start between now and the year. So the 152, you would add the 30, right? And so the year-end number I had something like 182 or so. Or were you referring to -- is that the right way to think about it or?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Robin, this is Juan Pablo. One other variable, of course, that impacts the equation is the number of rigs that are currently on term that are rolling off. And during the next -- during the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we have approximately 43 of those that are rolling off.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So you are thinking in terms of a net of like 152 at the end of the year with the 30 new contracts?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, and potentially additional contracts that would lead us to over 150 at the end of the fiscal year, yes.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, okay, understood. Okay, so my only other question then was that when we look at this oil rig count increasing, gas rig count decreasing, it seems like it, thus far, is kind of a wash that they're -- the one\u2019s offsetting the other, and that the real kind of unknown here is whether or not there are some new liquids-rich shale plays that emerge over the next year or so that, like the Utica or the Tuscaloosa, that may turn out to be new dynamic shale plays that would absorb a lot of rigs, et cetera, et cetera. So do you currently have rigs operating in some of these newer, less frequently talked about shale plays? And are any of your conversations about potential new builds relating to these plays?","John W. Lindsay","Robin, this is John. We don't have any rigs working in the Utica today. The rigs that were would likely -- obviously, that would be most likely to move to the Utica in the future would be rigs coming out of the Marcellus that are drilling dry gas. That's always a possibility, but we don't have any in the Utica now. We do have some existing customers that are using FlexRigs in other U.S. basins that have acreage positions in the Utica. So we wouldn't be surprised to see some activity in the Utica. I don't really have a feel for when that would be. We do have rigs working in Louisiana, FlexRigs that are capable of doing work in the Tuscaloosa Shale. Again, we've got customers that have acreage positions there as well. But don't -- we aren\u2019t, to my knowledge, we're not actually drilling any Tuscaloosa shale wells currently. I really can't think of anything that's new out there. But I think the point to keep thinking about is as rigs are redirected, use the Haynesville as an example, there's only \u2013 there\u2019s almost 100 rigs working there, only 40 are AC drive. There's not many mechanical rigs, which you wouldn't be surprised at that. But there's close to 50 SCR, or a little over 50 SCR rigs running. Some of those rigs are probably capable of doing some of this work in the Eagle Ford or Permian, but some of them may not be. And so that's where I think we continue to see questions or decisions made by customers on whether they're going to pay to move that rig 300, 400 or 500 miles, or whether they're going to go another route with a newer rig.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So nothing on the horizon that you can see where there's a new shale play that's got a whole lot of costumer interest that would translate into possible new FlexRig construction?","Hans Helmerich","Well, I think -- this is Hans, Robin. I think we're early on in the Utica. It's going to be a significant play. And there are others that kind of fit your headline or category, but I think the other thing to think about is as the customer focuses his technical teams and geoscience work over to oil and gas-rich liquids, you've got a lot of activity that won't be necessarily headliner status that continues to -- and I guess that's an important takeaway from this call is I can't think of a cycle where you have some uncertainty, and we've described the uncertainty. But if you have this kind of fallback of so much inventory and so much economical drilling, usually when you have price concerns, it makes everything uneconomic. Today, you have this strange delta between the natural gas prices and oil prices. But on the oil side, you've got a lot of work to be done that I think we successfully transitioned to. So that's hopefully the encouragement coming from the call.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Jack Moore with Harpswell Capital.","John Patrick Moore - Harpswell Capital Management, LLC","Can you just give some more color on how you see the rig demand market kind of evolving aside from the trend away from gas and towards liquids? What else do you see with respect to who the customers are and what they're looking for in terms of specs?","Hans Helmerich","Well, besides just some of the general things that we've talked about in terms of the type of drilling and the laterals are longer and the wells are more complex, I think one of the things that will continue to evolve is you'll shift into a more exploitation development concentration that becomes more factory-like. And that's a positive for us. So where other rigs may have been suitable to do some definition work as they go into a Phase 2 or a modality where they're really focused on their development, then I think it enhances our potential. And then I would expect you'll continue to see a trend towards pad drilling and the benefits it has in terms of environmental impact and the reduction of support services required for the same number of wells. So we're watching all of those things, and I think we're very well-positioned for that development.","John Patrick Moore - Harpswell Capital Management, LLC","I agree. And I appreciated the comment you gave on trying not to be myopic and manage quarter-to-quarter. I think that you certainly do your investors a big service by maintaining the long-term focus. So that's great. Can you talk about just in crews and how many people were working on rigs now versus a couple of years ago and what you see as your ability to satisfy your need for additional employees?","Hans Helmerich","Well, I think we've continued to develop our training capabilities. And one of the benefits as we've gotten bigger, we have the benefit of being able to seed the rigs coming online with experienced H&P folks and you have a mentoring dynamic and kind of a team-building dynamic there. And so I think we're actually in better shape today than we were in the last build cycle in '06 through '08. So there are areas where available labor is more challenging than where it might be otherwise. But even that, I think our guys do a good job of attracting, training and then retaining folks that want to be a part of the company and want to be part of the culture that we have.","Operator","Our final question is a follow-up from John Daniel with Simmons & Company.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Sorry to be the evil sell side guy that wants to focus on quarter-over-quarter changes, but...","Hans Helmerich","That doesn't make you evil, John.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Well, just after the guy before me was pretty nice, so here I come and mess everything up. But you mentioned that roughly 43 rigs will roll off contract in the coming quarters. And I mean, I presume a number of those are in liquids-rich areas. What I'm wondering is the customers that are using these rigs now that will be rolling off contract, are they indicating a desire to re-sign those rigs? And if so, are they looking at 6-month terms? Well to well? I mean can you just frame for us that discussion?","John W. Lindsay","John, the majority of those -- a large number of those 43 are more towards the back half of the fiscal year. The impression we have right now is that in most cases that we're aware of, the customer wants to keep the rig, and we would be surprised if they released the rig and there's always exceptions. But overall, we feel pretty encouraged by the level of interest. A lot of the rigs that are going to roll off are Flex 3s. And as you know, Flex 3s are in high demand regardless of the area. So we feel really good about the position. And again, many of those 40, at least we would expect, will roll back into a term contract. Again, it's going to be based on customer needs and the basin and what the demand is going to be.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Right. But the feeling today is a good one?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, I feel real confident. I feel real good about, again, about our customers and their budgets going forward. No doubt there's some concern with natural gas prices but there's a lot of plans out there that customers have for 2012 that are going to require FlexRigs to get it done.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just the last one for me. Presumably, you'll see some rigs in the dry gas market, certainly the ones that are on spot get released. Is there any noticeable difference in terms of leading-edge day rates between those rigs that are in the spot on the dry gas versus where they might migrate to?","John W. Lindsay","I don't think there's a major difference, John. I mean, we'll look at that and make certain that that isn't different than that. But I think it's going to be basically the same.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Alicia, and thank you, everybody, for joining us, and have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO. John and Juan Pablo will be sharing some comments with us, after which we will open up the call for questions.","As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, as discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics.

Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. Thank you again for joining us on our fourth fiscal quarter earnings call.","Fiscal 2017 witnessed the largest ramp-up of U.S. land rig activity in the company's history, which more than doubled even in the face of oil price uncertainty and volatility. We began the fiscal year with 95 rigs contracted in U.S. land, and after reaching trough operating levels of 66 rigs in May of 2016, and we close the year with 197 rigs, an increase of 102 FlexRigs, most of which were upgraded to super-spec capacity.","This achievement isn't possible without the advantage of having great people, a Family of Solutions, and over 2,000 rig years of FlexRig experience. This combination allows us to provide the right rig for the customer, and has enabled us to grow U.S. land market share to 20%.","The headlines during our fourth fiscal quarter were dominated by oil price uncertainty, which remained range-bound in the mid $40s and skewed expectations towards a substantial rig count reduction for the balance of 2017. Recall that during the summer, some experts were predicting the rig count to decline by 100 to 300 rigs by year-end. Even with that cautious outlook, H&P was able to grow its rig count and obtained leading edge pricing due to value proposition we provide to customers. We have also seen improvement in international markets where our rig count has increased to 17 active rigs.","Looking forward, oil price increases during the past several weeks could provide additional opportunities for rig count growth and higher day rates going into 2018, which should also improve our key financial metrics. A crucial driver for increased pricing is the limited super-spec capacity we see in the market today. The total super-spec fleet in the U.S. is estimated at 400 rigs, and we believe that H&P makes up about 40% of that total. The industry super-spec fleet is nearly fully utilized and the demand continues to be bolstered by customer requirements for increased capacity rigs that can effectively drill more complex horizontal wells with longer laterals. We believe the rig replacement cycle persists and that pricing will continue to improve.","Another consideration that needs to be factored in is the tight supply of upgradable super-spec fleet of only around 250 rigs is what we estimate today that could be candidates for super-spec upgrades. About half of which are already working. Unlike our peers, H&P has the capability to upgrade over 100 FlexRigs to super-spec capacity. One third of those FlexRigs are already active, and H&P has developed a very efficient process to make these upgrades during a rig move.","Of course, demand for additional higher performing rigs will drive our decisions on upgrades. We are optimistic that drilling economics will improve for E&Ps and that they will support the higher day rates and longer-term contracts that we will require to make these upgrade investments as market conditions improve. That said, the key take-away here is that H&P is uniquely positioned to grow its active rig count without building new rigs, whether that be under improved commodity pricing or the range-bound pricing we've experienced most of this past year.","Another critical driver of improved pricing is our ability to deliver on an attractive value proposition for our customers. We see our value proposition measured by performance and reliability that delivers a lower cost well. The super-spec classification provides the rig capability needed for the more complex and long lateral wells, but performance, reliability, data, and leading technology also play crucial roles in the value equation. You really need both capabilities in order to deliver the best performance for customers.","One critical support system we have developed to enhance reliability is our Center of Excellence for safety, learning, and performance. The Center of Excellence is in its fourth generation and we started up the first gen in 2004. We've been utilizing high-speed data generated from the rig and leveraging the Internet of Things, creative processes for years. We use several IoT tools developed for the Center of Excellence to proactively monitor rig equipment and operations by acting upon conditions, patterns, and recurring trends.","An example of this is our critical alarm and maintenance dashboard which provides complex event analysis based on real-time streaming data. The dashboard facilitates a more focused and prioritized approach to preventative and condition-based maintenance. And really what that effectively helps us deliver is better uptime and less downtime on the rigs. We use similar tools for all of the performance metrics that are vitally important to adding value for customers, like drilling performance, rig moves and trip times to name a few.","These are just some of the ways that technology and data are changing our business. Having a uniform fleet offers a significant competitive advantage over our peers as we are able to capture and leverage important data that is transforming the business.","Another technology that we are excited about is our acquisition of MOTIVE Drilling Technologies in June. The integration process is going smoothly, and we are seeing increased interest by E&Ps and directional drilling companies. MOTIVE has recently surpassed 4 million feet of hole using their Bit Guidance System to provide customers with drilling performance enhancements as well as more consistent and accurate wellbore. This leads to both short term economic improvements to drilling costs, but perhaps more importantly and impactful, can lead to enhanced production over the life of these wells.","It's important to keep in mind the Bit Guidance System isn't a downhole tool. It's a software solution, and therefore, H&P isn't competing in the traditional directional drilling business. With the pace of drilling today, in some cases directional drillers are struggling to keep pace with increased drilling speeds while delivering the accuracy required to place a wellbore in the desired sweet spot to maximize production. MOTIVE is currently active on 15 rigs and five of which are FlexRigs, serving 10 customers, with several additional rigs scheduled to pick up through the remainder of the year.","As we look to the future, we expect an ongoing trend to more complex well trajectories with tighter well spacing and longer lateral lengths, resulting in the need to enhance control of wellbore placement and quality. We are optimistic about the future with MOTIVE, as they represent a disruptive technology for directional drilling execution and providing significant value to customers.","So before turning the call over to Juan Pablo, in addition to having the right rigs, we have great people who are developing and harnessing leading-edge systems and technologies to support our value proposition to the customer. And I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank every one of them for their outstanding service.","And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I will expand on some of the announced information on each of our three drilling segments, followed by some comments on corporate-level details.","On our U.S. Land Drilling segment, let me first highlight some of the details related to our growth and activity during the last few months. Since the last earnings call on July 27, 2017, our activity has increased by 11 rigs. The Permian again led the way with seven rigs, followed by three in the Eagle Ford. We also experienced minor up-and-down movements in other basins. We have added 10 new customers since the last call as a result of the great performance that our organization is delivering.","Our three most active basins today are the Permian, the SCOOP and STACK play, and the Eagle Ford. The Permian remains our most active operation with 98 rigs contracted compared to 85 rigs during the 2014 peak. We have 46 idle FlexRigs in the area, 25 of which have 1,500-horsepower drawworks ratings. In the SCOOP and STACK and Eagle Ford today, we have 31 and 29 rigs contracted, coming off a low of 15 and 16 contracted rigs respectively.","As for the overall U.S. Land segment results corresponding to the fourth fiscal quarter, we exited the period with 197 contracted rigs and had an increase of approximately 6% in total quarterly revenue days. Most importantly, we continued to experience growth in activity from beginning to end of the quarter, and now expect a similar trend for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.","In general, increasing pricing in the spot market offset the decreasing proportion of rigs under long-term contracts that were priced years ago during strong markets. As a result, the adjusted average rig revenue per day remained flat at around $21,700 during the two most recent quarters.","The average rig expense per day decreased by over 2% to $13,905, mostly driven by a lower number of reactivated rigs generating upfront expenses as compared to the prior quarter. The average rig expense per day for the quarter was slightly higher than originally expected, primarily as a result of the higher than expected level of activity and the number of previously idle rigs that returned to work after many quarters of inactivity.","Looking ahead at the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect a sequential increase of approximately 4% to 5% in quarterly revenue days. We expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to remain relatively flat at approximately $21,700, as the underlying dynamics of newbuild term contract roll-offs and increasing spot pricing continue to offset one another.","Although our average day rate in the spot market is still in the high teens, leading-edge FlexRig pricing is in the low $20,000s. Thus, we continue to experience spot pricing improvement while delivering great value to customers through our differentiated offering. Our customers clearly understand how FlexRig performance and reliability levels allow them to lower their total well costs and to attain a higher quality wellbore.","The average rig expense per day level is expected to slightly increase to roughly $14,100. The expected increase is primarily attributable to expenses related to moving all five of our rigs in California to Texas in efforts to reduce overall expenses in the segment going forward and move the rigs to better markets. Those five FlexRigs have been idle for some time and are very well suited to go back to work in West Texas in the near future.","The average rig expense per day directly related to rigs that are already working in the U.S. Land segment continues to be around $13,000 per day. This general estimate excludes the impact of expenses directly related to inactive rigs and upfront reactivation expenses related to rigs that have been idle for a significant amount of time.","Approximately half of our 200 contracted rigs today are under term contracts, and roughly 40% of those rigs under term contracts were priced during strong markets before the 2014 downturn. The remaining rigs under term contracts were priced during the downturn and have a remaining average duration of less than one year. As a result, the expected average rig margin per day for all of our rigs already under term contracts in the segment during the first fiscal quarter is roughly $11,000.","Given the changing mix of term contracts that are currently in the backlog as a result of our success in securing over 30 rigs under new term contracts since our last call in late July, the expected annual rig margin per day averages for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, corresponding to all of our term contracts in the segment are now roughly $11,000, $12,300, and $15,500, respectively.","The average number of corresponding rigs that we already have under term contracts for each of those three years is approximately as follows: 80 for fiscal 2018, 30 for fiscal 2019, and 7 for fiscal 2020. No early termination notices for rigs in the segment have been received since mid-2016, but given prior notifications, we expect to generate approximately $4 million during the first fiscal quarter and a total of approximately $10 million during the following four quarters in early termination revenues.","Let me now transition to our Offshore operations. The number of quarterly revenue days decreased by approximately 10%, and we exited the fourth fiscal quarter with 5 contracted rigs. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially by about 5% to $12,088.","Management contracts contributed approximately $2.5 million to operating income, which was lower than expected as a result of some adjustments to our self-insurance reserves related to these contracts. As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2018, quarterly revenue days are expected to decrease by approximately 6%, with five rigs contracted during the quarter. Average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $13,000.","Moving on to our International Land operations, the adjusted average rig margin per day in the segment increased by 38% to $12,386, primarily as a result of favorable one-time adjustments. The number of revenue days for the quarter was 1,291, or an average of 14 contracted rigs. We exited the quarter with 16 rigs, including 13 in Argentina, two in Colombia, and one in Bahrain. The favorable impact of these improvements in adjusted margins and activity was partly offset by $3.7 million in foreign exchange expenses incurred during the quarter.","As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2018, quarterly revenue days are expected to increase by approximately 20%, potentially exiting the quarter with 17 active rigs. We were very pleased to see the significant level of uptick during the quarter, which was driven primarily by an agreement for 4 rigs going back to work in Argentina. We don't have any set commitments to expand our international activity beyond the mentioned 17 rigs as we enter calendar 2018, but do expect to see some opportunities for potential activity expansion going forward.","The average rig margin per day is expected to be approximately $8,000. This average rig margin per day may be higher if a rig rolling off a long-term contract is not re-contracted. As in that case, we would benefit from demobilization compensation during the quarter.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. Fiscal 2017 provided attractive opportunities to continue to add even greater capabilities to our existing FlexRigs. During that year, we upgraded over 90 rigs to specifications and highest demand, increasing the number of rigs with super-spec level capacity to over 150 in our U.S. Land segment. We also acquired a small company, MOTIVE Drilling Technologies as we continue to look for ways to increasingly add value to a customer.","As John described, we hope to see similar types of investment opportunities during fiscal 2018. Although early CapEx estimates for the year are currently in the range of $250 to $300 million, we expect to see further improvement in market conditions and additional attractive opportunities to invest in the business. Our balance sheet strength and high liquidity level provide great flexibility in pursuing these additional opportunities while at the same time sustaining current dividend levels.","A few more references that may be helpful for modeling purposes: First, maintenance CapEx including tubulars represent close to 40% of our current CapEx estimate for fiscal 2018. Second, our $560 million depreciation estimate includes approximately $20 million in abandonment charges. The latter may significantly fluctuate as a function of the volume of rig upgrades as the replaced equipment is abandoned. And last, the effective income tax rate is expected to be around 32% during fiscal 2018.","Let me now turn the call back to John.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Pablo.","We've commented for some time that a significant factor related to the ongoing rig replacement cycle is the number of legacy rigs still drilling unconventional, horizontal and directional wells. That figure continues to dwindle, but today there are still approximately 240 legacy rigs drilling in U.S. land. Approximately 155 of those are SCR rigs and the remainder are mechanical rigs.","When you consider how technology has changed the drilling process over just the past few years, 1970's technology is seriously deficient in its ability to deliver the high levels of performance and reliability demanded by customers who will be drilling even more complex well designs in the future. So we see that, again, as an opportunity going forward.","And, Chris, now we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Kurt.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, gentlemen, I think you provided a pretty upbeat, optimistic outlook heading out of this year going into next year, especially in sharp contrast to, as you mentioned, the expectations in kind of the mid-year dynamic. So with that said, yeah, I have also noticed that the incremental rigs that you've been able to place on the term contract relative to what you had shown back in the September timeframe kind of slowed a little bit. You guys, what would you chalk that up to in your mind? Is it the E&P companies going through their budgeting process and kind of getting a read on what they may need in 2018, or do you think that E&Ps are, again, maybe getting ready to hit the pause button?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Kurt, this is Juan Pablo. Are you referring to the 30 plus rigs that we were able to place under new term contracts as we continue to increase our rig count and as we continue to see roll-offs from old term contracts?","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just as one example, back in early September, you indicated that there maybe be an average of 59 rigs on term contract for fiscal 2018. In early October, that number jumped up to 75, and now in mid-November, we're looking at 80. So I'm not trying to nitpick, I'm just trying to gauge as to you saw a significant surge in incremental contracts between September and October, and a bit of a slowdown in that process going into November. So I just want to see if there's anything to read into that or not.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","This is Juan Pablo again. We don't see anything significantly different as compared to what we may have expected, Kurt. It's a combination of the market being relatively strong for FlexRigs. And as we continue to upgrade our fleet, customers on the one hand being willing to enter long-term contracts. And when we say long-term contracts, these are 12 months, 18-month type contracts in general. And our willingness to do that at the same time while we're investing in some of these upgrades. So, we think it's a win-win situation, but again, it's nothing that surprises us significantly.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that color. And John, a question for you is you look at the opportunities. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly when you referenced you have the most rigs that could be potentially upgraded to super-spec capability. And you went on to say even if the rig market remained flat, did I understand that correctly that you guys would still expect to increase your market share and upgrade assets even in a flat rig count environment?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, Kurt, I think we've been talking about that now for a while. I think we've been able to demonstrate that in a flattish, slightly down, I guess it depends on which rig count service you're looking at. But in general, over the last quarter, the rig count has been relatively flat, and we've been able to continue to add to our active fleet as well as continue to upgrade rigs to super-spec. And again, we've got our market share up to 20%.","I do think that the rig count that we've seen over the last quarter is a function of an expectation of $45 to $50 oil price or mid-$40 type oil prices. Obviously, oil prices have improved significantly over the last several weeks. We're not necessarily expecting or have a belief that it's going to remain there. But if you do see that outlook change toward an expectation of higher oil prices, then I think in some cases you may see not a dramatic improvement in rig count, but I think maybe a continued improvement in rig count.","And with that, what we've seen is a pretty high level of churn related to contracts and working for different customers. And I think customers in that sort of an environment, where they're focused pretty heavily on capital discipline, they're going to be looking at getting the best services and the best performance that they can get. And so if you're drilling more challenging wells and you don't have a rig that is super-spec capable, you've got some opportunity to improve your drilling times and lower your costs by having a higher capacity rig.","So I know it's a long answer to your question, but I think in general, we feel pretty confident that we can continue to grow our fleet and take some market share because of the value that our folks are able to provide in the field.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And what do you think the market price would have to be to economically justify a newbuild?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I'm not certain what a competitor's newbuild would be. I've heard estimates of low $20 million range. I think if that's the case, and if they're going to get a reasonable rate of return on that investment, I think you're going to need a $26,000 or $27,000 a day, day rate in order to get a reasonable rate of return. And again, I would think you'd want to have a multiple-year term contract.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it, thank you so much for the color.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Kurt.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","And, Kurt, let me add a little bit more granularity on your prior question as it relates to term contracts. Part of the consideration is that our fleet in the U.S. Land segment has been more or less 50% under term contract, 50% in the spot market. That metric has remained relatively flat, so that is not surprising.","The other consideration as well is that as availability of the right type of rig, as John mentioned, becomes tighter, customers are more willing and, as a matter of fact, requesting to enter into term contracts. So the combination of those two things I believe is what leads to what we saw and thus is not surprising given market conditions.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Chris, we can take the next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colin Davies with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much and good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. The tone, obviously, is far more positive than a quarter ago where the narrative was much more cautious, and you alluded to that in the prepared remarks. We have to talk about the dividend, and you did emphasize at the closing of the prepared remarks that you're anticipating being able to hold the current level of dividend through next year. Is it fair to say that those more cautious comments that you made on the last call, that's really been put to one side now in terms of the financial plan going through for next year?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Colin, this is John. I'll let Juan Pablo make a few remarks on this as well. He'll have some additional color. But I think in general, you look back and you just look at oil prices, I don't remember what oil was trading during that week, but I remember we had some low $40s and mid-$40s, and I think just the general outlook obviously was challenging.","At the same time, we also had a belief that the rig count was going to remain relatively flat, even though there were folks that were saying look for 100 to 300-rig count pull back. And we didn't believe that, we didn't see it coming from our customers. Obviously, it could have happened if oil would have remained in the low $40s or gone into the $30s, which I think a lot of people were thinking.","But I think in general as it relates to our outlook, yeah, with the oil prices that we've seen, not even necessarily $55 but just closer to $50, having some of the things in the market that just looking more positive. But we've continued to say that we believe we can continue to fund the dividend for the foreseeable future. We have a lot of confidence in that. We have a belief that, of course, this is a cyclical industry, and at some point in time, you would see the other side of the cycle. All we've seen for the last two and a half years, of course, three years is the downside to the cycle. And we believe there is an up cycle, an improvement in the future. And again, hopefully we're on the front end of that. But even if we're not, even if it's not in the next six months or a year, I think we're still well positioned. Juan Pablo, would you add anything more to that?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think that covers it well, John. Thank you.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's great, and just one follow-up on the CapEx guidance for next year, the $250 million to $300 million. You implied that 60% of that is upgrade CapEx beyond the maintenance CapEx. What should we be assuming in terms of upgrade cost and the scale of upgrade that's being constructed into that $250 million to $300 million plan?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Colin, this is Juan Pablo. To your first question, I think that most of the 60% is attributable to upgrades in general. As we look forward and look at the opportunities at hand, there are several things that we considered. One important consideration is lead times for certain components. Make sure that we are not constrained with bottlenecks and that we have the capability to quickly respond to market conditions, as we have in the past. And so part of what you see there is us just making sure that we're well prepared to respond to improving market conditions.","Another part of your question related to upgrade cost per rig, as you have heard us say before, as we upgrade our standard FlexRig3 rigs and add pad drilling capability through skidding systems and 7,500-psi systems in general, that type of upgrade can be a $2 million to $3 million per rig upgrade. We've also introduced some walking systems. So instead of a skidding capability, we add a walking system and also a 7,500-psi system. That type of investment is significantly higher at closer to $8 million. But what we've seen in the past is, again, a much higher number of skidding type upgrades as compared to walking.","So, that gives you a sense of how we're looking at upgrade costs. In both of those type of scenarios, we have found that our expected returns on incremental CapEx or investments on those rigs is very attractive. Especially, of course, on the skidding upgrades to super-spec capacity. Does that address your question, Colin?","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, I think it does. I was trying just to get to the extent to which you're seeing any mix shift between the more expensive upgrades and the skiddable upgrades as you're seeing the market pull from that. And also, to the extent you as a company and the plan leaning forward on building perhaps an inventory of upgraded, ready-to-go rigs so that you can respond to demand.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, Colin, that's a great question. I think with the outlook, I mean, let's face it. The outlook remains fairly uncertain with where oil for sure is going to go. We've got the OPEC meeting upcoming. We don't know for sure what the outcome's going to be there. But again, I think in the oil price range that we've talked about, we think we're going to have the ability to continue to upgrade. Just to kind of give you an example from last year, of course, we upgraded over 90 rigs. And I think we averaged 22 a quarter, with a range of anywhere from 12 upgrades to 38 upgrades per quarter. Clearly, we're not going to be doing anything on the 38 end, but 12 is reasonable. I mean, it's possible for us to do that.","But, as Juan Pablo said, we're not just going to \u2013 I guess to answer your question directly, our intent is not to upgrade rigs on spec with an expectation that the market's going to improve. I think we have the capability to respond much more quickly than others. And having the CapEx that we've talked about, enables us to prepare the supply chain, if you will, to be able to respond. And if we see an improving outlook going forward, in the next quarter, then we can ramp our cadence up. Very similar to what we did with new builds in the past, where we would start with 1 or 2 rigs a month, and when we saw demand, we were able to scale up to 4 rigs a month. And it would be the same thing with the upgrade if we saw that sort of a demand.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's very helpful color. Thanks very much, I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Colin.","Operator","And our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Following up to the upgrade questions. Juan Pablo, I just want to clarify. You said $2 million to $3 million, it sounded like, for the basic upgrade. And then it could be as high as $8 million. Is that an additional $8 million? So we should be thinking $10 million to $11 million as sort of the high end, or was that all-in for $8 million?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Marc, it is all in. So, just to clarify, we are only adding, in some cases, walking systems to rigs that don't have any type of skidding or multiple well pad drilling capabilities. So, we would never take a rig that already has a skidding system and add a walking system to that. Hopefully that clarifies the question.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, no, that is helpful. I guess, in the context of your earlier comments, prepared comments about 250 upgrade candidates in the marketplace, what do you think the average upgrade cost is for those? Because if we go back maybe three or four quarters to what you and some of your peers were saying, it sounded like most of the rigs to upgrade were in the couple million \u2013 $3 million range, and now we're hearing from you guys and we've heard from some others that there's this higher $8 million to $10 million for maybe the next layer of rigs to be upgraded. Do you have any comments on the market overall?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Marc, that's a great question. We only really know, of course, what our upgrades are. Again, to be clear, $2 million to $3 million is our skid system, and 7,500-psi on a base FlexRig3. And then the $8 million is to go all-in on the walking system. And so, what we're trying to do is develop some demand on that walking system. And we think that's going to- we'll see probably more of that as we go forward. But we haven't seen a huge demand pool.","But I think, in general, you're right. The upgrades as you get into the back end of that 250 rigs, the upgrades are going to be higher. You see some of our peers that are upgrading 1,000 horsepower AC rigs to 1,500 horsepower, and those are $8 million to $10 million investments and they have a relatively small number of candidates in order to do that.","So, that's what we like about our position, is that we have the capability to ramp up quickly. We have a big inventory. But as I said earlier, we're not going to do that on a speculative basis. We're going to do that based upon customer demand.","Of the 91 upgrades that we did, 3 of the 91 were walking systems last fiscal year. So going forward, we haven't really announced what our cadence would be, but I would imagine we'll have more skid system upgrades than we will the walking upgrades. But again, we're going to base it on demand from the customer.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Does it seem reasonable that you could execute all this CapEx for upgrade if the rig count's flat and if day rates are flat? Does that still kind of work for you?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","In terms of the CapEx that we've announced, is that what you're asking?","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess it works out to about $165 million of non-maintenance for these upgrades. Does that get executed if the overall rig count stays flat and day rates stay flat, albeit in the low $20,000 range for you guys?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think in the case of low $20,000 with some term contract commitment, not doing that on a well to well basis, that we would have some interest in continuing to add some upgrades into the market.","I think the other thing to consider, and this was, again, part of our prepared remarks and you won't be surprised. You've heard us talk about this before, but there still is that legacy fleet out there that's drilling these wells. Now, I don't know if they're horizontal wells and directional wells. Now, I don't know if they're drilling the longer laterals. But as this trend towards longer laterals continues, I think the average lateral is still around 7,000 feet. What we've seen is, when lateral lengths get to 7,000 to 8,000 feet, that's when you begin to see the traditional 5,000 psi systems begin to be stressed.","So, I think as these legacy rigs are asked to drill longer laterals, that's an opportunity for super-spec upgrades. And again, maintaining even in a flat rig count environment, but you've got high-grading that's going on that's embedded. It speaks to that churn that we talked about earlier.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sure, makes a lot of sense. Thanks, John. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Okay, Marc. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Thomas Curran with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","John, I'm sorry if I missed this in your introductory remarks, but where would your team currently place the industry's existing super-spec fleet? How big is it as of today? And then, on the new build side, what's your current tally or estimated range of the number of new builds that remain in the industry construction queue?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I'm not certain about the new build. Dave, do you have any feedback on the new build? It's a relatively small number. I'd say \u2013 yeah, I was going to say 10. I was going to say two handfuls. So about 10 that we hear about.","I think depending on the definition of super-spec, and the purest definition and the way we've outlined super-spec, we think there's around 400 that are active today in U.S. land. And, I think there's \u2013 if you add in some other categories, it could be as high as 450 to 475. Total, AC rigs running, drilling horizontal and directional wells is close to \u2013 according to the rig data, is close to 900 rigs.","So, about half of the AC rigs that are running today, we believe, are \u2013 close to half are upgraded to super-spec. And then there's another 250 that we think are upgrade candidates. We know we have 109 of those that we know are upgrade candidates. The others, again, we're just kind of looking at base model designs and making the assumption that those rigs can be upgraded. And if I'm not mistaken, the 250, about half of those are working. So out of the 250, about half of that upgradable fleet is actually working today.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","That's great, John. That's exactly the perfect super-spec supply side summary I was looking for.","And then turning to Argentina, it hasn't got much attention lately for some obvious reasons. But on the back of YPF's recently announced plan to spend $23 billion over the next five years, and the passage and sigh of relief coming out of the elections, what are your expectations there? Have you seen or do you expect to see new opportunities arise? And if so, would you be interested in them?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think there is some opportunities. It's funny how this international market can change pretty quickly, just like the U.S. market can change pretty quickly. It's nice to see our international rig count increasing, and a big portion of that has been in Argentina. So I do think that there are some additional opportunities for us.","If you recall, we sent the 10 Flex3s to Argentina for YPF several years ago. Those were all FlexRig3s with skid systems. And so again, I think we obviously have the rigs on the ground here and the capability to do that if the demand is there and the right contract and the right rate is there. Again, our rigs have done a great job drilling, so I think we'll have some opportunities.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","And then I'll squeeze in one more here. What is the CapEx allocation for MOTIVE in 2018? And what are the catalysts, if any, that might lead you to decide to meaningfully step that up?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","The CapEx, if you look at it as it relates to rigs, it's just very, very minimal. I'm not even sure, Juan Pablo has...","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","It's insignificant.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Again, the great news for us is it's really a software company, and the CapEx requirements are very, very low. And so that's one of the things that's really compelling about their business model. So I wouldn't expect it to be a needle-mover.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","All right. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Thomas. Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Brad.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Maybe some small questions first. The low $20,000s day rate that you cited, John, is that for a super-spec rig? So having the 7,500-psi mud system for example, and other bells and whistles versus something that is super-speccable?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yes, the low $20,000s is a super-spec rig, so it has the super-spec upgrades.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Okay, got it. You've had this nice experience of customers saying let's just get to work and then we'll upgrade on the fly, and you've talked to us about your ability to do that. Do you sense that that's still the primary way customers are contracting with you? Let's get going, and then we'll upgrade as we can? Or is it shifting to, I'd like to actually get a super-spec rig, so please put the investment in now and then we'll start?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Brad, for the most part, the customers that wanted super-spec \u2013 again, if you go back to \u2013 if you heard my earlier comments related to super-spec, we put out 91, about 22 or so a quarter. Most of those customers wanted the super-spec upgrade prior to taking the rig. And so what happened, though, is once we outran the capability of our cadence, that's when customers said hey, I'll go ahead and take the rig now and we'll upgrade it in a month or in two months, whatever time period.","So, I think again, today we're not at near the cadence that we were then. I think in most cases, we're able to make the upgrades prior to the rig going to work, not in all cases. But I think to the heart of your question, if it's a longer lateral, higher complexity well, by not having some of the super-spec upgrades, primarily on the pumping side and sometimes on the top drive side, top drive horsepower side, then you actually are putting the wellbore at risk if you don't have those capabilities. So I think it's that type of a trade-off. I think it depends on how long the lateral is and how challenging the wells might be.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","That makes sense, okay. I get that, okay. Juan Pablo, on the OpEx side, please, in U.S. onshore, is it reasonable for us to think about some sort of pro-rata stepping down over time? Let's just say hypothetically, you exit fiscal 2018 at 250 rigs working, for example. Could we think about operating expense being something like $13,250? In other words, because there's less allocating, there's less inactive rig costs. I'm obviously taking out the reactivation side. But is that the logical way for us to think about getting down to your underlying per rig OpEx?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think that's very reasonable, given the assumptions that you mentioned. We probably, in that scenario, have some idle rigs still out there. And so the 250, given that level of activity, sounds reasonable.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I mean the 250 rigs over the $13,000 average.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Right. Right, right, right. Okay. That's helpful. I just felt like I hadn't had a placeholder on that. And then maybe the last one, and I don't mean to cheat or something, but are you charging for MOTIVE services today, or would you say that the rigs on which it's working are still in trial mode? Could you just give us a status update there?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","MOTIVE is working as they were prior to the acquisition. And so yes, they have different business models in terms of how they charge, but yeah, they are charging for their services. And there are varying levels of the product that they provide, if you will. And so there are different levels of charges, depending upon what they're providing.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","So it's not part of \u2013 it's not thrown in on a FlexRig. It's not just part of the offering. And again, I think it's important to note that the MOTIVE activity today, a third of the work is on FlexRigs. The rest of it is on pier rigs.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Right. And you will remain open to using third-party rigs, I imagine, right?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We said it from the beginning that our intent is to keep MOTIVE independent. And we're kind of agnostic as to where they work. And again, they're working for E&Ps. Their customer base are E&Ps and directional drillers. And it doesn't matter to them whether they're on FlexRig or Brand x.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Right, right. Okay. Very good. Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Brad. Thanks.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","I'll turn it back, thanks.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Chris, we probably have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. And our last question comes from Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. My question is regarding the working capital is \u2013 what do you expect for working capital changes in 2018? Do you see that as a source of cash or cash use, assuming a flattish rig environment going forward?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Waqar, this is Juan Pablo. We would expect the working capital requirement to increase. So that would probably be a use, given that we have a relatively optimistic expectation in terms of what happens going forward. But, given your assumption, which is relatively flat, then working capital requirements may stay relatively flat as well.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. And then, your Offshore management contracts, how long should we expect that those revenues and models to continue?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We have \u2013 you're referring to the Offshore?","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's right, yeah.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. We have 5 rigs that are currently working. I believe that most of those, 4 of the 5 are under operating day rates. I believe that one still is under standby type day rates. So, nothing necessarily expected to change significantly going forward. There are some opportunities ahead, and we may see some movement there. But, I'd be speculating if I'd mention some numbers. I think, assuming that what we expect to see in the first fiscal quarter may recur, probably makes sense.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","The $4.5 million management contract margin that you have in the December quarter, you think that could reoccur again in the following quarters?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yes. We expect $4 million to $5 million in cash flow from management contracts during the quarter, and hopefully that again recurs going forward, at least for the foreseeable future.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Now, your international margin guidance, about $8,000, is that the new normal? Or it still has some load utilization costs embedded in that so it could get better in the future quarters?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, we would certainly hope to see improvement there, assuming that we continue to see increase in activity. But, given that we don't have any secured commitments, as I mentioned, we expect to exit with 17 rigs, approximately. And that would be a first fiscal quarter exit, entering calendar 2018. And so, if everything stays more or less as it is, I think that the assumption of the margin that we guided toward for the first fiscal quarter is fair to assume for following quarters. Again, we hope to do better, but at this point, we have nothing to announce in terms of additional contracts.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then just one final quick one on taxes for next year. You mentioned 32% tax rate. How do you see cash taxes versus reported taxes?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We probably will see our deferred income tax liability come down slightly. So, the tax benefit will suffer some. But not in a significant way.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Waqar.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thanks, Waqar.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I wanted to thank everyone again for participating on the call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast corresponding to the second quarter of fiscal 2012. With us today are Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO; and John Lindsay, Executive Vice President and COO. As usual and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. ","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment's operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release. ","I will now turn the call over to Hans Helmerich.","Hans Helmerich","Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone. As we discuss our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issue of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of theme from our comments from our previous quarterly call in January. We posed this question then of how much downward pressure would plummeting natural gas prices, overflowing storage and growing production bring to bear upon the domestic land drilling market. We spoke of this transition of rigs being redirected from dry gas targets to oil and liquid-rich targets, suggesting then that the gas-directed rig count will even now likely accelerate its decline trend. Well, that has certainly occurred and we know how the rest of the winter and early spring was the warmest since 1895, and gas prices proceeded to fall to 10-year lows. ","In response, customers have been more determined to rotate and redirect their rig rosters away from dry gas efforts. As we expected, higher performing Tier 1 AC drive rigs are best positioned to make the transition, but it won't be totally seamless as it drive some transitional expenses higher. ","For those rigs under the contractors, very little impact from being redirected and transitioned. In fact, we're fortunate to have a very high percentage of our U.S. land active fleet, 67%, currently under long-term contracts. That number remains strong over the next 2 quarters, with an average of 157 rigs under term contract. On the other hand, for rigs on the spot market, the transition at times can involve a new customer and a new basin and incur additional costs, which can include crew retention, some mobilization costs, and often, additional maintenance items. So if a rig experiences some idle time between customers, costs are incurred as we hold on to most of that crew and use the opportunity to perform needed maintenance on that rig. That said, while the accelerating rotation contributed to this quarter's surprisingly higher average daily cost, it was one of several factors. We expect that as we mentioned on our last call and then later updated, costs to return to a range somewhere above the $13,200 per day number. That number increased to $13,826. But if you take a slightly broader perspective when comparing our first 6 months of fiscal 2012 with the last 6 months of fiscal 2011, average costs are up $244, a more modest increase than when you compare just the last 2 quarters. ","Also beyond some transitional cost increases, we are seeing cost pressures on several fronts. Some higher costs are driven by the steady march of more complex and challenging drilling and faster cycle times. For example, from 2010 to 2011, our average footage per day increased over 10%. Already in 2012, we have seen average footage per day increase another 10%. So on one hand, our performance continues to improve, but at the same time, simply more is being demanded from the rig. ","We will manage the challenge in a manner that plays to our strengths. Our success is securing premium margins that's relied on consistently reducing the customer's well cycle time. So first, we will continue to focus on safety, delivering performance efficiencies and repeatability to the customer. We have found over the years that, that often requires additional investment and can incur additional cost. At the same time, that approach is not mutually exclusive to vigorously managing the cost side of our business to inform asset management, purchasing and innovative cost management. ","In balancing both sides, better efficiencies will win the day and will remain our primary focus. ","Going forward, we expect the average daily costs to flatten and trend slightly lower as some of the transitional issues run their course. Only 3 of the 80 rigs we have in the spot market are drilling for dry gas, and only another 3 of the dry-gas-directed rigs under term roll off during the third quarter. ","Turning for a minute to new builds where our manufacturing efforts continue to lead the industry as we are on track to complete 48 rigs in calendar 2012, outpacing the average of our top 3 competitors in the U.S. by approximately 2x. Since the start of the calendar year, we have previously announced an additional 9 orders to our order book, we continue to deliver rigs at a pace of 4 per month and our schedule going forward to complete 34 fully contracted rigs to customers. This strong backlog will allow us to stay busy throughout the 2012 calendar year. While we are continuing discussions with operators for new builds, those conversations are fewer and we would expect the current rig rotation to have to play out for several months before we gain a better visibility into the customers' demand for 2013 deliveries. We believe that the current new build cycle is far from over and will continue to provide us with attractive opportunities going forward. ","With that, I'm going to ask John to make his comments. I'm sorry, I'm going back to Juan Pablo for comments and then to John.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported $130 million in income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Although we continue to experience overall quarterly growth in revenue and rig activity, the higher daily rig expense levels mentioned by Hans contributed to a sequential decline in quarterly income from continuing operations. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to report that we do expect continued growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the third fiscal quarter. ","Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and our depreciation estimate for the year remains at $380 million. ","Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year has increased from $105 million to $110 million, and our interest expense estimates, which is net of capitalized interest, has been reduced from $13 million to approximately $10 million during fiscal 2012. ","Our debt-to-cap ratio is now under 9% and our liquidity level remains strong. We expect to fully fund this year's CapEx program and other scheduled outflows from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities. Nonetheless, we are working on a new but smaller long-term revolving credit facility to replace the $400 million facility that expired last December. The new facility may be used for issuance of letters of credit, temporary funding or other general corporate purposes during the coming years. ","Our tax rate for continuing operations for the second fiscal quarter was 36.8% and is expected to remain at approximately that level during the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year. ","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. The following comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter of 2012 for our 3 operating segments: U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal quarter of 2012. ","And I'll begin with our U.S. land segment second fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2% to 21,444 days, representing 236 average active rigs in the second quarter. As U.S. land segment took delivery of 12 new build FlexRigs during the quarter. An average of 154 rigs were active under term contracts, an average of 82 rigs were active in the spot market. ","Average rig revenue per day increased by $764 to $27,625 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Most of this difference was driven by the mix of rig types in each category as current pricing is similar for comparable rigs under term and in the spot market. ","Hans touched upon many factors to consider that can influence variability of expenses from quarter to quarter. In addition, as mentioned during the previous quarter's call as well as in our Investor Conference Presentation filed on March 23, we expected average rig expense to increase by at least $900 per day, given extraordinarily low levels of expense during the first quarter, combined with wage and other increases to be passed on to customers. ","The remainder of the sequential increase in daily expenses was attributable, one, to higher-than-usual expenses related to high investment rig equipment like top drives and pipe-handling equipment; two, higher-than-expected labor and maintenance expenses associated with rigs that became at least temporarily idle during the ongoing transition in the U.S.; three, higher-than-expected expenses that were passed on to customers; and 4, other expenses that are indirectly associated with rig operations. ","As a result of the average rigging expense per day increasing by $1,534 sequentially to $13,826, average rig margin per day decreased by $770 to $13,799 per day from the first fiscal quarter. Consequently, U.S. land operating income decreased 7% sequentially to $210 million as compared to the record operating income recorded in the first fiscal quarter. And this quarter is the second highest operating income on record for H&P U.S. land. ","Today, even with natural gas oversupply and weak prices, we remain positive about the long-term outlook for U.S. lands, as well as the third fiscal quarter. H&P continues to be the most active U.S. land contractor currently with 239 rigs, 239 contracted rigs and 29 idle rigs. Of these 239 rigs, 159 are under term contracts and 80 are in the spot market, including 77 FlexRigs. Not included in the 239 rigs are 2 recently completed new build FlexRig3s and one existing FlexRig3 that are scheduled to transfer out of the U.S. land inventory to international. And I will share more details on that later. ","In the third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 160 rigs are under term contracts for the third fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 157 rigs for the last 2 quarters of fiscal '12 and an average of 129 rigs for fiscal 2013. ","Excluding costs that are contractually passed on to customers, we expect average rig revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contracts to increase by approximately $250 in average for the last 2 fiscal quarters of 2012 and by approximately $550 in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are compared to the second fiscal quarter average rig revenue per day for rigs on term contracts. ","Average rig revenue per day in the third quarter may be flat to up slightly by as much as $200 per day. Third quarter spot market pricing has come under some pressure, but thus far, has been flat compared to the second fiscal quarter. ","And as we think about forecasting expenses for the third fiscal quarter, we believe a reasonable rough estimate of expenses should be in a range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget. Including the 6 new builds announced on March 23, 34 rigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month. ","Since 2006, H&P has built a total of 209 AC drive new build FlexRig3s, Flex 4s and FlexRig5s, all sponsored with a firm term contract. ","Now a review of our offshore segment second fiscal quarter results as 2 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were in transition between projects and our rig in Trinidad completed its contract toward the end of the second fiscal quarter and has been shipped back to the U.S. Primarily as a result of these factors, our offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.4 million to $9.8 million. Revenue days decreased by 10% to 627 days and average rig margin per day decreased by $1,610 to $20,561. ","Outlook for offshore as of today, the company's offshore segment has 6 rigs active and 3 rigs stacked, 2 of which are contracted. Of the stacked rigs, one of the stacked rigs is expected to go back to work in May and the second is expected to go back to work in the September quarter. ","In third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect offshore revenue days to be flat to down 5% and margins to be down 10% to 15%, as one-way rig transitions between projects and one rig begins a new project. ","The international land segment results from the first fiscal quarter to the second fiscal quarter decreased by approximately $9 million, resulting in a $1 million loss for the quarter. The primary factors driving the decrease were as follows: regular and expected expenses related to mobilizing 3 rigs between countries, all 3 of those rigs now have contract commitments; the absence of a $1.6 million retroactive day rate adjustment in Argentina that was a positive one-off that took place during the first fiscal quarter; a $1 million currency exchange loss and miscellaneous expenses and just other expense items in general during the quarter. ","Revenue days increased 2% to 1,761 days. Average rig margin per day decreased $4,131 to $4,884 per day. ","The outlook for international as of April 26, the international land segment has 20 rigs working and 2 additional rigs contracted, one of which is still in transit from Argentina to Colombia. 6 rigs were active and were contracted in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador, 5 in Argentina, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Of the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia. ","As discussed earlier, 2 recently completed new build FlexRigs3s originally contracted for the U.S. land segment will instead be sent to the Middle East at the customer's request. The first of these rigs is readying for transport and should contribute to the fourth fiscal quarter. The second rig will move in approximately 30 days and should contribute in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. ","The existing FlexRig3 sourced from the U.S. land segment has signed a letter of intent to work in the Neuquen Basin shale play in Argentina and will be working for a major oil company. The rig should contribute toward the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012. ","The total number of rigs for international land segment will increase to 29 rigs once the transfers are complete. Of the 29 total rigs, 16 will be FlexRigs. ","In the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margins to increase by approximately 10% to 20%. As we move beyond the disruptive effect of starting up the new rig contracts, we are optimistic that the margins and days for the international land segment will continue to increase beyond what we expect in the third fiscal quarter. ","We believe these most recent international opportunities reflect an improving market for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East. In each of these regions over the past 2 years, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice of the competitor conventional rig previously was able to provide. ","In closing, we continue to witness the ongoing shift to unconventional oil and liquid-rich plays that require drilling of more complex, horizontal directional wells. And we believe that trend is advantageous to H&P. This drilling complexity factor presents operational challenges for many old, conventional rigs and lower-end technology product offerings. These market trends, along with H&P safety, people and performance advantages, provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. ","And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. Priscilla, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Robin Shoemaker of Citigroup.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to ask -- Hans, I think initially in your comments, one of these cost factors is you mentioned more demanded of the rig from the operator. And in that context, I did hear you mention something about top drive investments being higher. So what else is in this category that you call more capability demanded from the rig, which increases daily operating expense?","Hans Helmerich","Robin, I think part of the point there is as we improve our footage per rig and we see the cycle times going faster, you can just imagine you're on an M&S basis, you're replacing more things, that rig is producing more hole every year. So it's just kind of that general notion that as you work faster and the rig produces more, you're going to drive some more costs. But top drives are an example of that, and John may want to comment. But top drives, on a repair basis, you capitalize some of that at first but then you expanse some. And so again, that's an example of an item that's going to drive higher expenses.","John W. Lindsay","Robin, I might add that as laterals get longer, torque requirements are higher. So that puts the top drives obviously in a higher service capability than what historically we've seen previous to the last, say, I don't know, 24 to 36 months. We're also pushing mud pumps harder, the operating pressures are getting higher. That obviously has an impact on expendable cost. You've got your pipe-handling equipment that is cycling the tubulars in and out of the hole at a much faster pace than that we've seen before. I mean, you can just imagine that we're up 10% 10 -- from calendar '10 to calendar '11, another over 10% already in 2012. So it's just a -- this is a much-increasing cycle time. It's great for our customers. It's great for us. But at times, it hits us on the quarterly variation.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, okay. Those examples were exactly what I was looking for. Understood. On the contracting side, are the customers looking at possibly more availability of FlexRigs on the spot market or that may become available on the spot market and prefer that hiring rigs that way rather than committing to term contracts? Or are they kind of stalling to see if more high-capability rigs become available without having to make long-term commitments?","Hans Helmerich","Yes, I think that's happening, Robin. We talked in our last call and this transition from the dry gas to the oil and liquids-rich plays has been going on since the fall of '08, and it's been somewhat orderly. I think with coming out of the winter, the psychological impact of gas prices falling below $2, I think it has focused the operators not only on accelerating that rotation, but then also stepping back, seeing how some of this plays out, seeing what the rotation of rigs will provide them opportunities for, meaning in terms of will they be able to secure Tier 1 rigs. All of that has increased recently. And I think they're playing a wait-and-see game. In our opinion, that takes a matter of time measured in months to work itself out. But it does impact both to your point about are they willing to just immediately rotate into term. It impacts that thinking. And I also think it impacts for a short amount of time their decision on new builds. In a way, the rotation and the uncertainty of this market becomes a competitor, if you will, for additional new build orders. We also think that is a short-term phenomena.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just one final clarification on -- you haven't seen anything or you didn't mention anything, as you saw in 2009 where you had customers seeking early terminations of term contracts or paying for rigs to be idle according to the terms of the contract.","Hans Helmerich","I'll say, no, we haven't in terms of comparing it to 2009, where hopefully that was a once-in-a-lifetime event. And that's not happening today. John, do you want to add anything to that?","John W. Lindsay","Yes. I would agree. It's nothing like the '09 cycle. We have had a couple of rigs that have gotten relieved in dry gas basins that have had 30 to 90 days left on their term. But again, those are not big deals.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Joe Hill from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Hans, just getting back to some of the points you were making earlier about faster cycle times, higher costs, customer preferences, can you give us a little more detail on strategically how you can recapture that value add from the faster cycle time? It seems like obviously, the market isn't terribly receptive to that sort of thing right now. But if you are adding value with that, I would think you would be able to price accordingly and at least maintain margin.","Hans Helmerich","I think that's exactly right long term. I think, Joe, we're in one of those periods where the softness in the cycle is kind of feeling its way out. We're confident that because of the amount of opportunities from the oil and liquids-rich plays and the amount of drilling inventory that this is a temporary and will end up being a shorter kind of lull in the cycle. But you just think about our approach and why we have a confidence that the AC drive rigs are going to stay active and in high demand. That's based on the efficiencies and the reduced cycle times we provide. And so when we have a customer that says, \"Gosh, I'm going to slow down or I'm going to turn a rig loose and we're contracting, keeping that rig active and contracting it with a new customer. We're going to keep the crews intact, we're going to look for opportunities. Hey, let's -- we've got a few days of idle time. If this rig needs to be spruced up some and have some money to spent on it, we're going to do that. And it's, again, part of a strategy of having a premium offerings and premium performance. And I think that in the long run, back to your question, gets rewarded as you've seen with premium average margins but we may be in a time right now where we've got pressure on pricing and then pressure on cost. But I think we'll manage our way through that.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the cost bump quarter-on-quarter, can we parse that out? I think it was $1,500 or thereabouts into what was pass-through. I think you guys had talked about $500 in labor pass-through and then what is rotational costs and then what are just inflationary costs?.","John W. Lindsay","Joe, this is John. The $13,200 is kind of our original feeling on where we would be. That was up $900 from the previous quarter. Again, the previous quarter, as you know, was very low. The additional $600 was a combination of things, kind of like I laid out. There's a portion of that, that is associated with top drives and just higher capital cost equipment, pipe-handling equipment, things like that, that were substantially higher in this quarter than usual. The transitional costs that Hans talked about, that was a big portion. We had about 11 -- 11, 12 rigs change hands in the quarter, meaning from one customer to another. About 70% of those or more transitioned from a basin to another basin. So there's -- again, the operator is paying for the mobilization cost but we have those soft costs associated with it that Hans spoke to. You compare that to previous quarters, we had, again, kind of that churn, if you will, from customer to customer, similar type numbers but a very small percentage of those went basin to basin, so you have a much less expenses and much less time kind of waiting between locations, if you know what I mean. So that drove that. There's a certain aspect to just other higher costs that are passed through to the customer. And then finally, just the other side of it that aren't necessarily directed right at what's going on at the rig, whether it may be taxes or whether it may be overhead type things that just hit in this quarter that were higher in this quarter compared to the last quarter.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then last question for me. What's it cost you to move a rig to Latin America or the Middle East?","Hans Helmerich","I'm thinking ballpark. A range -- just the mobilization cost is it's probably $1 million to $2 million. Again, there's a lot of variation there. Those are typically reimbursable costs. Those are costs that the operator foots the bill on that.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is that amortized or is that taken lump sum?","Hans Helmerich","It depends on the project. Typically, it is amortized.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I can ask about the 3 contracted rigs that are rolling over in the third quarter, and maybe you can put this within the context of what you've seen in the last couple of quarters with rigs roll off. What percentage can we expect to sort of stay with the existing original contract or writer? What's sort of the retention rate that you all are experiencing? And if you look at the last couple of quarters, Hans, you've mentioned cost pressures and price pressures a couple of times without getting too specific. I'm wondering if you can quantify that whether the market is really sort of trending flat on your rollovers or whether we can really see rigs tick down on any of these rigs as they roll off.","Hans Helmerich","Good. Well, we might provide some clarification. The 3 rigs under term that roll off are rigs that are gas-directed today. So we're just projecting that as those roll off and come into the spot market that we will market those into a region that is more oil-directed. So I think I heard your question being would we anticipate that those go back under some kind of term contract? I would think today in this market, they probably would not, particularly though to the customer and what the customers' plans are and how they want to position their own rig rosters. And so it wouldn't be unusual for it to roll into a term that might be shorter than the 3-year term that it rolled off of but still under some kind of term coverage. We mentioned just the term coverage going into the second part of the year is still being robust at 157 rigs that will remain under term contract through the rest of our fiscal year. So I hope I'm being responsive to what your question is.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","You are, Hans. I think -- I was getting at the retention side of it, but I think what you're saying is when they're released, they're released, and they're really out for tender to the marketplace as opposed to likely to be re-contracted with original operators.","Hans Helmerich","Yes. Well, I don't want to overstate that because we would expect to have a chance for that original operator to keep that rig and keep it working. I mentioned the 3 again because to me, the point is that's a pretty small exposure to dry- gas-directed rigs. And so we have 3 in the spot market. We have 3 that will roll over in term. So I was trying to give you a sense of, well, is this rotation going to look as tough in the next couple of quarters as it might have impacted us this quarter and the answer is, no, it won't. So whether those 3 rigs stay with our customers, I don't want to imply that they absolutely will not. They may.","John W. Lindsay","I might add a little bit of detail to that, Michael. In those particular cases, I think 2 of those 3 will roll to different customers, and the pricing will be flat to slightly up on those particular contracts. The other rig, I think, will most likely stay with other customer. But part of what's going on in the background is -- in these -- in the 2 cases where the rigs are changing hands, they're -- those rigs are actually going to work for a customer that has a competitor rig rolling off of term, and this rig is going to go in and fulfill that particular slot. And then I think in one case, it's going in on a spot well-to-well contract, and the other case, I think we're picking up maybe a one-year term. But as Hans said, there's really all kinds of variations, but what we're seeing is quite a bit of interest in FlexRigs, and particularly in the Eagle Ford and Permian and somewhat in the Bakken, but particularly, in the Eagle Ford and Permian.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. I think where I was going with the follow-up was if there is concern about day-rate degradation in the market more broadly, what's the sort of staying power or stickiness of the FlexRig based on performance? And I know everybody throws that term out, bifurcation, but can the markets really -- can the performance differentiate in a looser market? And it sounds like that's the case if we use the example of those 3.","Hans Helmerich","Well, I think that's right. I think that there are pricing pressures out there. There's some collateral bleed-over from the price reductions you're seeing in pressure pumping where that also kind of pulls in the drilling rig in terms of the customer. I'd love to see prices go down. But at the same time, we're hoping to see the stickiness on pricing based exactly on what you're talking about, the performance and looking back over just the most recent soft cycle where the pricing for the highest performing rigs. So if you will, the bifurcation did occur where those rigs remain at the higher pricing level.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And last one for me, a little bit more longer term, if I can. As I've run through the model and what your cash generation looks like with the base of FlexRigs that you have in the fleet, the CapEx requirements even at a decent pace of new building are much smaller relative to your overall cash flow. And I'm wondering if you've given some thought to the issue of cash return, what that might look like over the next 2 or 3 years. And maybe within the context of that question, if you could address the equity holdings in other companies that you have.","Hans Helmerich","Okay, good. In terms of the crossover point where we begin to generate free cash, I think we'll go look for what opportunities do we have to achieve high rates of return on capital. And if we don't have the building opportunities, you won't see us stray very far in terms of acquisitions or investing in other things. So it gets back to a pretty straightforward approach to how will we return that free cash to shareholders. And there are not that many different ways to do that, it's either through share repurchase or higher dividend streams. So those are things that we'll look at. What we're hoping to see is this replacement cycle providing opportunities where we can continue to build and provide the kind of attractive returns that we've been able to historically secure for that. So it's a good question. And then your question about the equity, in primarily at the Schlumberger and Atwood. We that as a source of funds. So we would like to see those funds rotated into FlexRigs.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Mike Breard with Hodges Capital.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","Nabors announced they had 9 term contracts with a major operator for 3 years, expect it to generate $280 million to $300 million and another $25 million if they use the Canrig Technology. This would work out to day rates of about $28,400 to $33,000. Is that more or less the range of day rates you're getting on new motors?","Hans Helmerich","Well, Mike, we saw that announcement too, and we're still kind of sorting out, some of it was rigs that they had already built on spec. And so we're trying to sort that out. And you're backing into a day rate range. I think some of our newer day rates are in the high 20s and slightly higher than that. So, John, unless you have something else in terms of what you know about competitive...","John W. Lindsay","Yes. Mike, the 28 to 33, I think that appears to me at least to be on the high side of what would be possible. But, again, I don't have any other details besides that.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","I guess, this could be for the Bakken where the drilling costs are higher because of the weather?","John W. Lindsay","That would be more reasonable. I wouldn't expect to have that kind of a revenue stream in somewhere outside of the Bakken. Because Bakken expenses are quite high and the investment is quite high.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Mark Close with Oppenheimer & Close.","Mark Close - Oppenheimer & Close, Inc.","I wonder -- can you -- the $13,200 expense level, is that -- do you think that's attainable by, say, calendar Q4 of this year to get back down to that from a trend standpoint? And the other question is, regarding Argentina, obviously there's a rather unsettled situation there, and there's been -- I think, those 3 rigs that are stacked have been idle for quite some time. Is there a thought to moving them out of Argentina? Are they being marketed elsewhere, or is there a likelihood that they'll be put back to work?","John W. Lindsay","Mark, this is John. I'll start with Argentina. There are 3 rigs stacked there. I think there's a likelihood that at least one of those rigs will go back to work fairly soon. It's not going to impact third quarter, maybe not even the fourth. But I think it will go to work. And I think the other 2 rigs will have an outlook for activity. They're bigger rigs, so they're not rigs that would be directed towards the shale play in the Neuquen area. I think they do have opportunity to work in the Neuquen area on deeper type of activity. So I think the rigs, it make sense for them to be there right now as evidenced by we did move a 30,000-horsepower rig out of Argentina. It's going into Colombia, and it does have a contract. So if we are successful in getting a contract outside of Argentina, then, yes, we'll move the rig out of there. I mean, we're overall pretty excited about Argentina and the opportunity there and excited to have a FlexRig going in down there. I think it will start off as a nice trend for us. On the cost, again, we're all disappointed in the high expense that we had for the quarter. But it isn't unusual to have some pretty high variation just on a quarter-to-quarter base. And I think for us to talk about $13,200 right now is a little unreasonable. Again, we're kind of thinking this $13,500 to $13,800 range and that's where we're hoping to get. I haven't really started thinking about fourth quarter yet. It's always possible, but again, we're seeing, as Hans mentioned, we're seeing a lot of demand put on the rigs, and there's still this transitioning of rigs from basin to basin, even simple transition, they seem very simple, we're even seeing the rigs transition out of Eagle Ford into the Permian. I wouldn't be surprised to see some rigs in Oklahoma transition into the Permian. So I think this transitional period, I think, definitely happens through the third quarter and it may even continue into the fourth quarter. It's just hard to say right now.","Operator","We'll go now to the side of Josh Lingsch from Simmons & Company.","Josh C. Lingsch - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Going back to the previous question about the gas rigs going off term and the 3 rigs in some market. How many are those are expected to return in gas markets in and the next 6 months to a year.","Hans Helmerich","I'm sorry. What was the question?","Josh C. Lingsch - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Going back to the gas rigs that are rolling off contract, the gas rigs you still have in the spot market. How many of those are expected to remain in gas markets? And the reason I ask is if you're moving those into oil basins, is the customer still paying for that move or is that something that you're proactively moving to an oil market and pay the rig costs, pay the cost of rig move yourself?","Hans Helmerich","I suspect in the case of the 3 that were mentioned earlier, those are going to go to work in oil and liquids-rich markets. And I would say in most cases, the rigs will rotate out of gas into the oil and liquids-rich, but not in every case. But I think in most cases, they will. The mobilization cost has been on the operator, the operator has paid that. And so that's kind our expectation going forward is that they'll continue to do that.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Hans Helmerich","Thank you, Priscilla, and thank you, everyone for joining us. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at any time."],"11009":["Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Wilson","Thank you, Erica, and welcome, everyone, to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2018. With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Mark Smith, Vice President and CFO. John and Mark will be sharing some comments with us, after which we'll open the call for questions.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll remind everyone that this call will include forward looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management\u2019s expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.","Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As such our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements.","We\u2019ll also be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations in yesterday\u2019s press release.","With that said, I'll turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us on our fourth fiscal quarter earnings call. H&P\u2019s leadership position and super-spec rigs contributed to another strong quarter of operational results. We expect to see additional demand for our company\u2019s super-spec FlexRigs heading into our new fiscal year, particularly as customers push lateral length, pad drilling and an industry trend toward greater well complexity. In addition, our new lines of digital-technology-based solutions gained further traction during the quarter as more customers realized the value these solutions provide.","I will focus my remarks on five main areas this morning. First, we believe the super-spec rig market in U.S. Land is fully utilized, and we still see indications that additional demand will continue even as oil prices have move lower. This robust demand is supportive of the increased pricing environment, and we are persistent in our pursuit of higher dayrates, as a result of the value proposition we deliver to our customers. We upgraded and converted 54 FlexRigs to super-spec during fiscal 2018. This brought the total number of super-spec FlexRigs in our U.S. Land fleet to 207, at the close of the fiscal year, and we believe we have over 40% of the active industry super-spec rigs. As stated earlier, we are seeing further demand for these rigs and expect to maintain an average upgrade or conversion cadence of 12 rigs per quarter for the next few quarters. Currently, we have the first and second fiscal 2019 quarters fully committed at this cadence and there are already a few commitments in the third fiscal quarter. The average length of term for these contracts is over two years in duration and rates are in the mid-$20,000 per day range. The incremental investment in these upgrades generates a good return for our shareholders and enhances the overall value of the H&P fleet by enabling the technology offerings we have developed.","Second, we have long articulated the benefits of our uniform FlexRigs fleet design from the vantage point of safety, operations, supply chain and efficiency. Now with the rollout of our FlexApp solutions, during the latter half of fiscal 2018, we are further capitalized on this design benefit by expanding the use of our uniform fleet as a standardized digital platform. FlexApps are software-based applications that can be layered on top of our drilling control systems to improve reliability and performance, increasing the value proposition of H&P's family of solutions. FlexApp solutions are a separate revenue stream from the rig day rate and are designed to provide a substantial value addition to the customer via the FlexRig digital platform. By reducing human variability, FlexApps enhance efficiency by automating our drillers' tasks and decisions resulting in improved life of downhole drilling tools, fewer bit trips, as well as better drilling performance and overall reliability for the customer. We have several case studies that demonstrate considerable savings and improved reliability for customers through the use of our FlexApp solutions.","For my third point, I want to mention our new software technology subsidiaries that are focused on wellbore quality and wellbore placement. MOTIVE Drilling Technologies and MagVAR continue to gain momentum with customers, both on FlexRigs as well as other competitor rigs. The MOTIVE bit guidance software system provides a higher-quality wellbore, and MagVAR provides MWD survey correction services to improve wellbore placement. Both subsidiaries are growing activity as the industry continues to grow longer laterals on multi-well pads with tighter well spacing on those pads. These trends are compelling more operators to acknowledge the benefits of adopting these technologies, and we believe demand is close to reaching a tipping point. To date, the adoption of MOTIVE technology has provided bit guidance on nearly 10 million feet of hole, and it is currently operating on approximately 30 rigs. MagVAR is currently on approximately 270 rigs, up from 180 rigs in December of 2017, at the time of the acquisition and continues to grow activity in the survey correction market. As the industry continues to move into a manufacturing drilling mode, the standardization of directional drilling processes through digital approaches allows greater repeatability and transparency of execution, which brings tremendous value to customer.","Combining these disruptive technologies with our uniform digital FlexRig platform, we are in initial customer beta testing of AutoSlide, our new automated directional drilling sliding solution that we announced in September. AutoSlide takes an evolutionary step in drilling automation by eliminating human intervention during slide operations for all sections of a horizontal well. The results have been promising for adding greater reliability and performance to the customer. AutoSlide is a crucial step toward dramatically increasing quality and the repeatability of a critical operation that is typically performed by a third-party human-directional driller. Our beta testing has already resulted in higher quality slides with less time required for sliding, which delivers faster overall performance in the vertical, the curve and the lateral. We hope to be commercial in the Midland basin during the first calendar quarter of 2019. AutoSlide is an important step in our autonomous drilling platform. As we look to the future, we expect an ongoing trend to more complex well trajectories, more tightly controlled-well spacing and longer lateral lengths, and the resulting demand for enhanced control of wellbore placement and quality. Therefore, we are optimistic about MOTIVE and MagVAR technologies and believe they will enhance the current state of directional drilling execution, and hold the promise of providing significant value to the customer.","Now shifting to the fourth topic, concerning commercial model. In order for H&P and the other oil field services companies that are able to demonstrate value creation through new technologies, through super-spec upgrades and through automation strategies, we must develop new pricing solutions that allow us to make a reasonable rate of return, so we can continue to make these value adding investments. A case in point; during fiscal 2018, as compared to 2014, our FlexRig fleet growing performance delivered nearly the same amount of footage, approximately 75 million feet of wellbore with an average of 65 fewer working rigs. The average FlexRig, in 2018, drilled approximately 65,000 more feet of hole, which is about a 25% increase, than the average FlexRig in 2014. And the acid test of value to the customer, this increased drilling efficiency per rig delivered over one additional well per year, including, about 2,500 feet of additional wellbore per well. We recognized that our company isn\u2019t responsible for all of that performance enhancement. But it is clear to us that the current dayrate model is not adequately compensating us for the additional value being derived in well cost savings and productivity. We are pursuing new pricing models for FlexRigs, for FlexApps, MOTIVE and MagVAR, which includes performance-based contracts, revenue per foot, lump sum and other models are under consideration.","Finally, before turning the call over to Mark, it's important to understand our views for rig activity related to the oil price outlook. Our 2019 budget was set in October at a time when oil prices were $10 to $15 a barrel higher than they are today. However, oil prices today are still higher than the average price expected by E&Ps preparing for the 2018 budgeting cycle last year. Consequently, what we are hearing from customers today hasn't changed over the past few months in terms of activity going forward for the remainder of calendar year 2018 and into the first quarter of 2019.","Our term contract book is strong with approximately 60% of the currently active fleet on term, and our upgrade cadence of approximately 12 rigs per quarter committed through March of 2019. H&P has about 50% of the upgradable AC drive fleet, which gives us the ability to upgrade more effectively than our peers.","It's also important to recognize that even with softer oil prices, approximately 28% of the active industry fleet drilling horizontal wells today are legacy rigs, and aren't as efficient safe and reliable as the other 72% of the active industry rigs that represent the AC drive technology fleet.","So while our super-spec rigs are geared towards operators who are drilling longer laterals, we have started to see some interest from customer discussions targeting fluctuate tours for our E&P programs that don't require super-spec capacity.","Our Flex4s provide a high level of value offered at a lower price point than a super-spec FlexRig, allowing us to compete head-to-head with legacy rigs and when there's less technically challenging work as a result of the value proposition delivered. So we are looking forward to a strong 2019. I believe all of our areas, U.S. Land, Offshore, International, and our Technology subsidiaries are positioned well heading into the New Year.","So now I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks, John. Today I will review our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2018 operating results, provide guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2019, and comment on our financial position.","Let's start with highlights for the recently completed fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 2018. The company's generated quarterly revenues of $697 million versus $649 million in the previous quarter, totaling $2.5 billion for the fiscal year. The quarterly increase in revenue is primarily due to those the increase in revenue days and average quarterly revenue per day in the U.S. Land segment. Direct operating costs remained relatively flat at $449 million for the fourth quarter versus $445 million for the previous quarter.","Our impairments charge of $23 million, incurred in Q4, consisted of certain equipment view to the wind down of Ecuador operations, the write-down to scrap value or previously decommissioned rigs and the impairment of goodwill related to our TerraVici business line.","General and administrative expenses totaled $53 million for the fourth quarter and $200 million for the fiscal year in line with our previous guidance on the July call. Our income tax provision from continuing operations for the fourth quarter includes discrete tax items of approximately $13.5 million related to state and international jurisdictions where we operate.","Concluding this quarter's results, Helmerich & Payne earned $0.02 per diluted share versus a loss of $0.08 in the previous quarter. The fourth quarter was adversely impacted by $0.17 per share of select items as highlighted in our press release. Absent these items, the adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.19 in the fourth quarter versus an adjusted loss of $0.01 during the third fiscal quarter.","Earnings totaled $4.37 per diluted share for the full fiscal year 2018, of which select items accounted for $4.24 per diluted share. This $4.24 is comprised primarily of a non-cash gain related to a reduction of H&P\u2019s deferred income tax liability, as a result of applying the new corporate tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Asset select items fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings for the full year were $0.13 per diluted share. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 totaled $467 million, above our previous guidance, due largely to the completion of more super-spec upgrades than anticipated.","Now turning to our three segments, beginning with the U.S. Land segment. We exited the fourth fiscal quarter with 232 contracted rigs and had an increase of approximately 4% in the number of active rigs quarter-to-quarter, achieving a current 21% U.S. Land market share. We experienced a growth in activity throughout the fourth quarter, and we expect to see a similar increase through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Since the last earnings call on July 26, 2018, our activity has increased by 11 rigs. The Eagle Ford led the way in Q4 with an eight rig increase to 45 active rigs. The fourth quarter's favorable market conditions continued to allow pricing improvements. Excluding early termination revenue, our average rig revenue per day increased to $24,321 for the quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased to $14,109, due in part to the timing of favorable adjustments to certain self-insurance expenses.","Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for U.S. Land, we expect a sequential increase of approximately 4% to 5% in the quarterly number of revenue days, representing an average rig count of approximately 239 rigs. Compared to the fourth quarter at approximately $24,300 per day, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to increase to a range from $24,500 to $25,000. The expected increase is driven by market dynamics due to the tight market share for super-spec rigs across numerous basins. We are also encouraged to see the customer response to our FlexApp offerings that John mentioned earlier.","The midpoint average rig expense per day is expected to remain consistent with our prior guidance and be in a range of $14,500 to $14,900 per day, absent one-time benefits related to self-insurance expense adjustments that affected the fourth quarter. The normalized average rig expense per day directly related to rigs working in the U.S. Land segment remains approximately $13,700. This per day estimate excludes the impact of expenses directly related to inactive rigs and the upfront reactivation expenses related to rigs that have been idle for a significant amount of time.","We had an average of 135 active rigs under term contracts during the fourth quarter, and today, 148 of our 238 contracted rigs are under term contracts. All but 21 were priced in the post downturn market. We expect to have an average of 141 rigs under term contract in the first fiscal quarter, earning an average margin of $11,000 per day. For the 114 rigs we already have under term contract in 2019, we expect average margins to approach $12,000. For the 43 rigs currently under term contract in fiscal 2020, the associated margin is approaching $13,000.","Turning to our Offshore Operations segment, we continued with six active rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially due to the absence of one-time costs that were incurred in the prior quarter. As we look forward to the first fiscal quarter of 2019, for the Offshore segment, we currently have six of our eight offshore rigs contracted. One of these rigs is undergoing approximately 30 days of planned maintenance during the quarter. The average rig margin per day offshore is expected to $8,500 to $11,000 during the first quarter.","Regarding our International Land segment, as expected, the number of quarterly revenue days increased slightly in the fourth quarter by approximately 3%. The average rig margin per day in the segment decreased by $1,336 to $8,658 in the third quarter. This decrease was due to one-time cost of approximately $2 million associated with our wind down of Ecuadorian operations. We have not had any activity in Ecuador since January 2016, and the country has had only a modest recovery since 2014 with less than 10 rigs working. This limited scale opportunity drove our decision to focus on other international markets in our planning horizon.","As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for International, we expect to end the first quarter with 18 to 19 active rigs in the segment. As a reminder, we believe we have the leading market share in Argentina with over 20% of the active rig count and closer to 40% as it relates to unconventional drilling. The average rig margin per day is expected to be flat at approximately $8,000 to $9,000 during the first quarter. We also expect to incur some final wind down expenses for Ecuador in the first quarter.","Now let me look forward for the fiscal first quarter and full fiscal year 2019. At fiscal yearend, our revenue backlog from our U.S. Land fleet was roughly $1.1 billion for rigs under term contract, which we define as rig contracts with original fixed terms of greater than six months and that contain early termination provisions.","As the contracting market has remained strong, our current revenue backlog for the U.S. Land fleet as of today's call is approximately $1.4 billion, representing an increase of 300 million since September 30. Capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2019 year are expected to range between $650 and $680 million based on market expectations as of today, which are markedly different than the planning environment this time last year. This investment in our fleet is comprised of three distinct buckets.","Given our current customer commitments going into the third quarter of fiscal 2019, bucket one contains capital expenditures to upgrade and convert FlexRigs to super-spec capacity. This organic growth and fleet high-grade opportunity is estimated to range between $260 and $275 million and represents the largest portion of our 2019 CapEx plan. The second bucket is estimated to range between $195 and $240 million and consists of FlexRig capital maintenance. Such capital maintenance averages between 750,000 to 1 million per active rig. The third bucket of 2019 CapEx will range from $165 to $195 million and is comprised of two items: a) A catchup bulk spare equipment purchase for the scale of our growing super-spec fleet. For example, at the 2014 peak, our working rigs had two pumps on average, whereas today our fleet averages nearly three pumps. Similarly, in 2014, the typical rigs tubular complement was 18,000 feet, whereas today's lateral wells have driven the typical tubular footage per rig to 22,000 feet and higher. And, b) Rig reactivation costs, which have increased the average idle time of reactivated rigs as now close to four years of stacking.","During fiscal 2019, the CapEx I outlined is expected to be weighted to the first three quarters as we take advantage of our differentiated ability to respond to the current demand for super-spec rigs through our reactivation and upgrade programs. We are currently planning to upgrade a higher percentage of walking rigs in the 2019 program versus skidding systems. Therefore, the average upgrade cost per rig will be higher compared to last year, reminding that the average skid system is approximately $3 million and the average walking package is approximately $8 million. The total number of upgrades that we complete with our budgeted dollars will depend on market demand and our final mix of skidding versus walking pad capability.","Depreciation for fiscal 2019 is expected to be approximately $560 million, plus an additional $30 million or so in abandonments and accelerated depreciations that are primarily related to super-spec FlexRig upgrades. The total of $590 million is approximately $5 million more than fiscal 2018. Our general and administrative expenses for the full fiscal year 2019 are expected to be flat for '18 at approximately $200 million. We will leverage our capabilities in Tulsa that were expanded in fiscal 2018 to support our growing rig fleet, with a goal to reduce certain field expenses.","Following our acquisitions of MOTIVE and MagVAR, we expect to experience growth of their respective services to an expanding customer base and rig count. Harkening back to John's commentary on AutoSlide, we are investing in our enhanced technology and innovation capabilities through increased research and development efforts, which we expect to total between $25 million to $30 million in fiscal 2019.","The statutory U.S. federal income tax rate for our fiscal 2019 year-end will be approximately 21%. In addition to the U.S. statutory rate, we are expecting incremental state and foreign income taxes to impact our tax provision, resulting in an effective 2019 tax rate range of between 28% and 32%.","Now looking at our financial position. Helmerich & Payne had cash on hand of approximately $284 million at September 30, 2018, and short-term investments of $42 million. Including our revolving credit facility availability, our liquidity was approximately $587 million. On November 13, 2018, we extended and expanded our revolving credit facility to $750 million, enhancing our liquidity by an additional $450 million and extending our maturity date to 2023. While we do not currently expect to utilize this facility during 2019, it is a prudent step given our current operating scale and the nature of our industry. Our debt-to-capital at quarter-end was 10%, a best-in-class measurement among our peer group. We have no debt maturity until 2025.","Opportunistic reinvestment in our FlexRig fleet continues to strengthen the asset base while increasing market share. Our U.S. Land market share at the 2014 peak was 15% and has grown to 21% today. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity level, and term contract backlog provide H&P the flexibility to pursue planned reactivation and upgrade programs, develop and deploy differentiating technology, and return capital to shareholders through our very long-standing dividend. In fiscal 2019, we will consume a portion of our cash on hand. As stated, we do not expect to have to utilize our credit facility availability. Looking ahead in our planning horizon, the investment in our fleet and drilling solutions technologies, coupled with the disciplined and centralized cost focus will yield expanding positive free cash flows.","That concludes our prepared comments for the fourth fiscal quarter. Let me now turn the call over to Erica for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Byron Pope from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Byron Pope","John, I have a question for you. It seems as though the super-spec rigs are quickly becoming the standard in the U.S. Land rig market, much in the way that Helmerich and Payne led the way for AC drive rigs to become the industry standard and realize that you guys collect tons of data coming off the rigs in your center of excellence. And so, my question is, could you give some qualitative color on the extent to which the horizontal wells you're drilling for your customers today are making super-spec rigs must haves as opposed to nice haves? I mean, the fact that you guys have visibility well into the spring of next year with regard to upgrades suggests that, again, these types of rigs are becoming must haves. So just looking for some qualitative color there.","John Lindsay","Sure, Byron. One of the things that you've heard us mention, probably over the last year or better, is the last thing we want to do is overbuild the super-spec fleet -- the capacity of the super-spec market. So one of the things that we have done is we've continued to monitor on a quarterly basis the super-spec rigs that we have and are they actually doing super-spec work. And pretty consistently quarter to quarter, we've seen anywhere from 85% to 90% of the wells that we're drilling actually require the capacities that a super-spec rig has. And so, I think that's a pretty good measure of demand.","So a couple of the primary components are related to the depth of the well, the length of the lateral, whether the rig is pad drilling work or single-well work, and what kind of pressure that's required for the mud system -- the mud pumps to be able to effectively pump and the amount of setback capacity, all those sorts of things. So to answer your question, we are still seeing demand clearly by the amount of backlog that we have and the commitments we have through March.","Byron Pope","And then, just a second very quick question. With regard to the different commercial models that you touched on, I'm assuming that the baseline today is most, if not all of your FlexRigs are on the standard dayrate type of model. But how do you see the emergence of these different models unfolding over the next couple of years?","John Lindsay","Yes, it's a great point. As I've thought through -- you go back to when we very first started building FlexRigs, when the market figured it out and we were really able to create some adoption with customers. And if you remember, we weren't building any new rigs unless we had a three-year term contract that would provide a reasonable rate of return in excess of our cost of capital and getting 85% to 90% of our money back in the term of the contract. And that was -- while it had been done previously in our industry, it wasn't -- I don't think it was done nearly in as widespread of way.","And so, I think that's where we are today. You just look at the performance metrics that I talked about. We worked 65 fewer rigs in 2018 and effectively drilled the same amount of footage. And so, the great news is we are providing great value for our customers. And so, our expectation is -- and like we did when we started the FlexRig program, is we're going to have customers that are partners in this. We have very, very strong partners, customers that we work with that have been partners for a long period of time. The fact of the matter is, what used to be a 20-day well or a 30-day well is now a 20-day well, or a 20-day well sometimes is a 15 or a 10-day well. And so, we obviously on a revenue basis are making less and less.","So, we don't have all the models figured out, but what we do know is that today we do have a small mix of entering into different pricing models, whether it's performance, whether it's a lump sum, or other types of contracts. And so, we're going to continue to look at that. As we progress to the next year or two, I think we'll start to see a mix shift away from just the dayrate model.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Tommy Moll from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Tommy Moll","John, you indicated there's continued upward pressure on dayrates given the full utilization in the super-spec market and characterized leading edge for an upgrade as still somewhere in the mid 20s. Going forward, do you think we're creeping mid toward the mid to high 20s? And given H&P's leadership in terms of the number of rigs that are eligible for upgrade on pretty modest CapEx requirements, should we expect price momentum to slow at some point as H&P continues to take market share before we end up in the high 20s new build zip code?","John Lindsay","Well, Tommy, we don't think that we're going to see pricing that's going to reach the new-build economics area. I mean, I think the fact of the matter is, if you're really going to get a reasonable rate of return on the types of investments on these new -- what a new rig would cost today, $24, $24 million, you really need close to $30,000 a day. So, we're still several thousand dollars a day from that pricing point. And so, I don't think that that's where we're going to go.","I do think that there is continued opportunity to push pricing. If you think about it in mid 20s, we still have some capacity to push it to the upper limits of that mid 20s. So, I think we're going to continue to push toward that leading edge. So, we'll start to see the average rate pushing more toward the leading edge rate as opposed to it being on the lower end of that mid 20s.","Tommy Moll","One follow-up. I wanted to dive down on the CapEx guide you gave for $650 to $680 million, with roughly 40% of that allocated to upgrades. If I assume 12 a quarter, the math comes out to about $5.5 million per, which seems reasonable. My first question is whether that's the correct logic underlying the budget and if you could confirm the willingness to flex that number given final upgrade decisions that are ultimately going to require contracts with customers upfront. And then second, I just wanted to ask for some more detail on the third portion of the budget allocated for reactivations and other bulk purchases. Mark, you gave us some helpful details on that in the transcript. I wonder if you could enlighten us a little more on those themes, in particular on the reactivation piece. Does that relate to the roughly 12 per quarter upgrades that you're thinking about, or is there something else that that would relate to?","John Lindsay","Starting with your second question first. Yes, the reactivation relates directly to the upgrade cadence. The other bit of that, the bulk purchases relate to what has been a very quickly expanding rig fleet count for us over the last couple of years, coupled with a rig fleet that is drilling a lot more complex well for our client and is running a lot harder. We, as I said, just in a couple years' time, we've gone from an average of two pumps per rig to nearly three. So, you can imagine the amount of capital spares one has to have on hand to be able to deal with any downtime or regular planned maintenance related to the various pieces of equipment. So there's a lot of stuff in there and other -- obviously as I called out in my prepared remarks, tubular has fit that bill, as well. I hope that answers your question. If not, come back with a follow-up. The first part of your question, I think your math is correct. We're not going to -- we have been averaging about 12 rigs per quarter. But as you know, that varies quarter to quarter, and that's really dependent purely on customer demand that we're meeting. We are able to really flex our capabilities up and down related to the client's need in our family of solutions, and we can come up with a skidding or walking package as appropriate. As we look over the planning horizon, our intention is to build out more walking rig capabilities so we have a more balanced fleet as we conclude the upgrade program. But as we move through the program, that will be dependent on direct customer discussions, because as we have said before, each and every upgrade that comes out is backed by a client contract.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","So John, very, very interesting commentary here on the commercial and pricing models, and I appreciate the added information you've kind of provided. So if I recall my early days in this business that land drillers at some point were on a turnkey kind of basis and footage drilled kind of basis, and I think that had kind of mixed results from a financial performance standpoint at the time. Just wondering if you can kind of give us some context on that and how you guys feel more -- maybe what makes you more confident about the opportunity maybe to switch commercial models and generate better financial returns [indiscernible] just a straight dayrate model?","John Lindsay","Yes, Kurt. Yes, I have some...When I started with the company in '87 and in the '90s, we did a lot of footage and turnkey work, and so that's not what we're talking about. We're not talking about going back to a traditional footage, taking on more risk model or turnkey, although there could be some modified versions of that. Obviously, the types of wells we're drilling today and the efficiencies that we're seeing are much different than what we've ever seen in this industry before. And so, that's really what we're addressing.","Unfortunately, I don't have an exact answer for you, but what I do know kind of relates what I said on the earlier question as it relates to partnerships. And as you partner with your customers and you come to realization that there's ways that both sides can win, because it's really not designed to be sides -- both parties can win, and that's what we're wanting to do. We're very pleased today that, as we've said, we're seeing much improved pricing. We have better margins. But as you fast forward to where we're going to be two or three years from now, if we don't change some modeling now, we're not going to be in a strong position as we would like and as our shareholders would expect us to be. So I know that's not a direct answer to your question. I don't necessarily see us going in a wide-scale turnkey-type operation, if that's what you're asking.","Kurt Hallead","And then follow-up would be, maybe midyear going into third quarter, there's some discussion on varying land drilling conference calls that going into 2019 the expectation was E&P companies would effectively be resetting their budgets at the higher oil price levels than what they were set for 2018, and obviously you could set the stage for a very strong and robust demand for land drilling rigs. And now that we've kind of round tripped on oil prices, as you've indicated and we've all seen on the screens, if E&P companies keep the budgets set in the $50 to $60 range, how would you handicap the growth in overall drilling activity on a full-year basis in '19. You've already given us good guidance on the initial start of your fiscal year, but wondering how you would handicap it if we're still in a 50 to 60 budgeting environment.","John Lindsay","Yes, it's interesting because obviously we've had a lot of conversations with various customers, and the feeling that I've gotten through that is whether it's 55 to 60 or whether it's up to 70, I think the budgets are going to remain pretty strong. The question, of course, is how much actual rig count growth do we see? And I think a portion of that is -- a function of an earlier question and some of the commentary that we have related to the replacement cycle and the number of legacy, much older rigs that are still out there working. And so, if the average lateral that today we think is around 8,000 feet, which is up from around 6,000 feet in 2015\/2016 -- if that average lateral continues to trend higher, which we suspect that it will, and it goes to 8,500, goes to 9,000 feet, then you begin to put a lot of these older rigs, less capable rigs in a position where they just can't perform at same levels as a super-spec rig does. So I think our belief is that we're going to continue to see demand for super-spec. How that relates to the overall rig count growth is very hard to determine. But we sure don't see any customers that are readjusting budgets or readjusting rig count. We haven't seen any of that.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","First one is just kind of a quick one. Can you just advise us of how many upgradeable rigs you still have? I believe back in a September presentation you listed 76 rigs and 32% of those contracted at that time.","John Lindsay","We have about 65 approximately rigs that are available for upgrade, and in our view that is about 60% of the industry's upgradeable inventory. And how many of those are active?","Mark Smith","25","John Lindsay","Yeah. So, 25 of the 65 are active.","Jeffrey Campbell","Then, I'd just like to ask a little bit broader question. On this call you've already provided some really thoughtful color concerning pricing and changes in the industry. I wanted to bring the apps and these value-added services into the discussion. Do you -- you have this evolving model of the rig as a digital network with less human error. Do you see that as something that can further enhance revenue generation on the rig, or is it more about increasing utilization as you continue to build out and upgrade in fleet?","John Lindsay","Yes, Jeff. That's a great question. Our intent is that those FlexApps, automation technology like AutoSlide, those are additional value streams that we would get an additional compensation. And again, it's back to how is the best way to structure that. I'm sure with every customer it'll be a little bit different. But the fact is we're investing real effort, real money and time into the development of these apps, into the development into our software, into our FlexRig operating system. And so as Mark said, I think our R&D budget is between $25 and $30 million. We're going to continue to have investments. Our hope is that we can continue to make acquisitions of technology-type companies. And again, the focus for those technologies is not just for the sake of the technology, but rather for the value-add that that technology can provide.","And so, what we're trying to understand is how do we best provide another level of value for our customers? MOTIVE is a great example. We've seen for a long time at H&P, and other operators and drilling contractors have, as well, that the human directional driller on the rig, if he isn't the most effective he can destroy value proposition for the FlexRig. And so, having a bit guidance system that enhances that directional driller's capability is a big win, plus it delivers a higher level of wellbore quality, less torque velocity, which have even added benefits of overall performance of downhole drilling tools, ultimately to the overall quality of the wellbore.","Through all of those, our intent is to receive a compensation that's related to the value proposition that we're providing. Some of that, like AutoSlide, is still to be determined. We have really early success that we've seen with the two customers that were in beta testing with. It's going really well. So, more to come on that, but our intent is to get an additional revenue stream.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Brad Handler from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brad Handler","Sorry about that. Sorry. Thanks, good morning. I had it on mute. Let's talk about CapEx some more, please. It was higher than I was expecting -- your budget for next year. And maybe you could accuse me of just not listening carefully enough; I think I could stand guilty of that. But let's talk about it a little bit. And maybe the perspective I'd love you to take is, although I'm hardly going to ask you to start talking about fiscal 2020, I'm curious to just understand what may come -- what may roll off versus what may stay or what may grow in terms of capital requirements. So for example, if you're building up your inventory of spares, presumably that's not -- there's a little bit of onetime-ishness within that, right? You sort of get it to a better place than it is. At the same time, if lateral lengths keep growing and the demands on your rigs keep growing, then your maintenance CapEx might continue to rise. And I'm not exactly clear about the reactivation concept. I guess I probably have made the mistake of thinking that the $3 to $8 million sort of incorporated reactivation expenses, and obviously it does not. So, presumably that stays, but does that get worse as you dig deeper and deeper in to your inventories as you continue to roll rigs out, say in 2020? So, I know there's a lot of moving pieces to that, but hopefully you can -- I can remind you of them and you can speak to that, but that would all be very helpful to hear.","John Lindsay","Brad, please provide the prompts as we move along so make we sure to hit all your points. But as we said, we have 238 rigs working today and we have another 40 from one of the previous questions in the upgrade inventory that are currently idle. So, as we work through the upgrade inventory, one can get to a high 200 number of rigs that would work to your question in fiscal 2020. All things being equal at that point, assuming we have not moved to new-build pricing territory. We certainly would see a reduction in the capital expenditure levels, and, therefore, an increase in free cash flow. So if you could envision what we still believe is an accurate $750,000 to $1 million per active rig for maintenance CapEx per annum, you would have some other amount of fleet-wide spares. For example, you could layer on top of that. But that number, I could imagine it being somewhere from, I don't know, $275 to $350 million per year at a high 200 rig count flat state.","Brad Handler","Okay. I get that. If we start to think about reactive -- one of the elements in my too-long question was whether reactivations do get more expensive as you're digging deeper into inventory. Is that a factor?","John Lindsay","I think we've sort of crescendoed toward this $4 million I mentioned in the prepared comments. I don't really see it getting higher than that as we move through these remaining 40.","Brad Handler","But then -- I see your point. Then the Flex4s are just a different animal altogether if you move toward that set, right? Not necessarily in worse shape. It's just a different category of rig. Is that fair of me to think?","Mark Smith","Yes, that's fair. And as John said in his prepared comments, we see marked opportunity for those separate and apart from the super-spec arena.","John Lindsay","Yes, Brad. And I think we've talked about this. It may have been a question on the last call or we talked about it previously, and that is the FlexRig4s, because of all the effort we have in the upgrade program on super-spec, what we haven't really spent a lot of time on is looking at the Flex4s and you what else can we do with those to be even more competitive in the market than what we are right now. But to your point, those rigs are in no worse shape than the Flex3s that we're bringing out. As Mark said, a lot of these rigs have been stacked on average for four years, so we've maintained them very, very well. But a lot of that equipment that is equipment that needed to be used has been used on other rigs. There's no reason for that equipment to sit there and deteriorate; you want to use it.","Brad Handler","That gives me a lot to think about. Maybe a shorter question from me on daily operating expense. You guys have been very consistent with laying out sort of the run rate in the high 13s versus where you're at. But as we think about OpEx through the course of fiscal '19, should that number be trending lower per day essentially because the average rig count continues to rise? Or does it hold because the reactivation pace continues to layer on top of it and self-insurance issues are what they are?","Mark Smith","Brad, as we move through fiscal '19, I think we'll certainly have the upgrade and reactivation program keep us at the higher end of the range, but to the same point, as we move past that and into 2020, you will have an absence of reactivation costs, again assuming that flat-line rig count, which is a very clouded crystal ball looking out pretty far in time. Simultaneously, you have less in active rigs. So, yeah, I think you start moving from the 14,700 range closer to the 13,700 over a much longer planning horizon.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","So, a couple final ones from me, just a house-keeping one. Mark, the step-up in the ETR for the year, would the increment largely be cash taxes?","Mark Smith","Yes, state and foreign jurisdiction cash taxes.","Scott Gruber","Okay, got it. And then just coming back to the traction y'all seem to be getting on these alternative models, John, it sounds like you prefer a model that incorporates more bonus features moving versus moving back toward the pure footage or turnkey models that we've seen in the past. Is that the right way we should think about it?","John Lindsay","Yes. I think it's a -- use a performance model as an example. The idea is for everyone to win. We want to continue to enhance our customers' efficiency, including wellbore quality, including wellbore placement, and doing that in a more autonomous, reliable fashion. I mean, FlexRigs are already the most reliable rig in the fleet as you look at performance over time. But as you add on these technology adders, there's even more reliability -- higher levels of reliability. So, the idea is not to -- like I said earlier, not to go into necessarily a turnkey model, but some sort of a performance model, a footage-type arrangement. We've even done lump sum-type things. But we just have to have it in a larger scale so we're protecting ourselves longer term as these well cycles get faster and faster.","Scott Gruber","Do you think it'll be easier to get paid in full and realize full value to the new technologies through these alternative models and through bonus features versus just getting paid incremental rate?","Mark Smith","Well, if you think about the technologies that we're providing -- use AutoSlide as an example. And again, it's not fully commercial yet, but assuming that we can get there, we believe that's a technology that no one else really has. And so, if that's something that the customer wants that see value in, then there's a value proposition there for them to be receive and be willing to pay for. And so, I think it's a distinctive. It's distinctive and it's differentiating. And it's very much like what I described or at least tried to describe with where we were when we rolled out the FlexRigs to begin with. Part of the thing that was missed early on is that that AC drive technology was a differentiator and it wasn't just another rig. It actually had components that would drive higher levels of value. And we got paid for that. Again, as well cycles get faster and faster, it's harder and harder to get paid for that. And so, as we layer on additional technologies and capabilities, we've got to figure out ways to get paid for it. That's really kind of the simplicity of it. I'm really not in a position to share a whole lot about how we're going to do it. I think each customer has the potential to be slightly different, and that's fine, it's just as long as we're getting recognized and compensated for that.","Scott Gruber","Got it. We'll stay tuned. It's great to hear that you have [inaudible]. Appreciate it.","Mark Smith","Thanks, Scott. I appreciate it. Okay. Erica, that was the last question?","Operator","Yes. I'd like to turn it back over to John Lindsay for closing remarks.","John Lindsay","Okay, Erica. Thank you. So, everyone, thank you again for joining us this morning. As always, we're very appreciative to all of our folks at H&P for their efforts on focusing and driving value for our customers. We are optimistic about the future and optimistic that we can compete and perform during 2019. So, we're looking forward to it. Thank you all, and have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation on today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dave Wilson, Director of IR. Please go ahead.","Dave Wilson","Thank you, Priscilla, and welcome everyone to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Mark Smith, Vice President and CFO. John and Mark will be sharing some comments with us, after which, we'll open the call for questions.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'll remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As such our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations in yesterday's press release.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone and thank you again for joining us on our first fiscal quarter earnings call.","The Company delivered sequentially improved operational results in the face of falling crude oil prices, which decreased by more than 30% during the quarter. Still customer demand for super-spec rigs continued during the first fiscal quarter and H&P responded by upgrading and converting 14 additional rigs to super-spec capacity.","This brought our total number of super-spec FlexRigs to 221 at calendar year-end. Today our activity stands at 238 rigs in US land, with 213 super-spec rigs active.","Predictably, demand for additional super-spec rigs this first calendar quarter has softened largely due to oil price uncertainty, as well as customers' objectives to keep spending within cash flow in the coming year. The fourth quarter decline in commodity prices was a cogent reminder of the capital-intensive and cyclical nature of our business. And with that outlook, we reduced CapEx by more than 20%, or $150 million.","We believe that oil prices will remain volatile and that price swings will occur over shorter durations of time. Just look at today's WTI price for instance. It's up 20% to 25% from a low price in December of around $44 a barrel.","We have more than 70 customers split roughly 50-50 between public and private E&Ps. However, about 80% of our active rigs are working for publicly traded E&P companies.","Discussions with several customers regarding CapEx outlook indicates a mix of increasing, decreasing and flat spending budgets. However the consistent theme is discipline, principally keeping 2019 spending within cash flow. Typically, we also see a few customers that seek opportunity and advantage by riding the fence, keeping one foot on the gas pedal and the other foot on the brake.","Mark will discuss the details of our activity outlook in his prepared remarks, but with the improvement in oil prices here recently, we are seeing the pace of releases slowing. We believe an oil price above $50 a barrel WTI will continue to temper rig releases and during the past few weeks, we have noticed an increase in customers inquiring about rig availability.","If we see oil prices stabilize at today's ranges, or even slightly above current levels, we would expect to see several FlexRigs reactivated in the March and April timeframe. Several recent industry-wide predictions indicate a drop in overall US land rig count of 100 to 200 rigs over the first half of 2019.","If oil prices remain above $50 a barrel, our extrapolated view on the industry rig count is that fewer than 100 rigs will drop in the horizontal rig market, but as we've also learned, history can be a pretty fickle indicator when it comes to predicting future rig counts.","Rig pricing is a hot topic and with our super-spec FlexRigs fleet forecasted to be around 90% utilization, we expect today's pricing to remain firm in the mid-$20,000 day range. Value pricing is one element of our contracting strategy, but we also have approximately 64% of our active fleet today under term contracts, up from 50% term coverage a year ago and the average term is slightly over one year.","Shale-ready rigs are in the greatest demand and that is where our market share is concentrated. The value we provide is currently priced at a reasonable level and we have formed partnerships with many of our customers that enable additional levels of value creation. There's little doubt that well complexity will continue to increase and this should drive demand towards the top-performing and safest super-spec rigs that deliver the best value and reliability at the well-site.","The Company's large offering of highly capable super-spec FlexRigs and the associated FlexApp technologies provide enhanced wellbore quality and downhole tool reliability. FlexApps are becoming essential tools as drilling in the most prolific U.S. basins continue to increase in complexity. These performance advantages become even more imperative in a softer cycle.","Now, switching geographies for a moment, our international segment is seeing some positive indication of potential growth in both the Middle East and Argentina. We have super-spec FlexRig availability in the US, and are ready to mobilize assets to these markets should financially attractive and scalable opportunities arise to do so.","The FlexRig is ideally suited for long horizontal wells and when coupled with our FlexApps, these offerings could add significant value for our international customers as unconventional plays gain momentum.","The newly created H&P Technology segment, which encompasses H&P's digital technology and software based subsidiaries, Motive and MagVar also saw increased demand during the quarter. Individually or combined with the FlexRig, our wellbore quality and placement technologies greatly enhance the economic potential of a well and adds significant value to our customers and their stakeholders.","We are seeing early adopters that are excited about the next level of innovation related to automation. However, there is substantial inertia in the industry to overcome that resistance to technological change, as well as some roles changing at the rig site.","In some respect, this is no different from the push back we saw in the early stages of the FlexRig, both from customers and competitors. The new FlexRig technology over 10 years ago was disruptive in the industry and the adoption was slower than we liked at the time, but embracing the benefits of that technology became inevitable.","H&P's drilling automation technology, AutoSlide, continues to gain momentum and interest from customers. I'm going to share a direct quote from one of our customers that's experiencing beta testing for AutoSlide today.","And the quote was, \u201cRecently, we had two rigs sitting side-by-side and drilling the curve in the same target zone, in the same area and the machine, AutoSlide, actually beat the man, the directional driller. So it shows there is a future for this and it's coming. It is already here and it's just getting better.\u201d","This is a great example of the technology working and a customer being very satisfied and ready to convert his fleet to AutoSlide. As I mentioned earlier, Motive technology and AutoSlide technology is disruptive on the rig from a personnel basis and the adoption rate is slower than some would expect. I say this to stress the importance of being patient. Technology adoption is coming and I believe we can improve adoption rates by improving our change management tools and training. And we'll have more to come on this in the future.","Another opportunity for positive change is in new pricing models. Since our last call in November, we've received a lot of questions and feedback related to our new pricing models. Our new commercialization and pricing approach is one centered on value creation and shared gains. Partnering for innovation and value is where our pricing model is different from others in the market.","We've reached out to our loyal customers who value performance to work with us on new business models that will ensure long-term benefits for both parties and ongoing performance improvement in our industry. We are investing more time in listening and collaborating with customers on how to improve well performance through unique value applications and technologies. I believe our customers are seeing the value we provide through a different lens, it's beyond just day rate, our customers recognize and appreciate that you get what you pay for.","Before turning the call over to Mark, we believe there are excellent opportunities ahead as the Company's ability to plan, adapt and respond in a near term volatile market is one of the cornerstones of our long-term success. H&P has responded in order to better position itself for the future.","We, of course, can't do that without having quality people that are willing to represent the H&P brand day in and day out. And despite industry conditions, the primary focus remains constant at H&P, to partner with our customers and add value through our people, our FlexRig fleet and our technologies.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks John.","Today, I will review our fiscal first quarter 2019 operating results, provide guidance for the second quarter, update full fiscal year guidance as appropriate, and comment on our financial position. Let's start with highlights for the recently completed first quarter.","The Company generated quarterly revenues of $741 million versus $697 million in the previous quarter. The quarterly increase in revenue is primarily due to increases in both the number of revenue days and in the average quarterly revenue per day in the U.S. land segment.","Total direct operating costs incurred were $489 million for the first quarter versus $449 million for the previous quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to 10 additional rigs working in US land and to a $21 million onetime legal settlement of which $18 million affected the first fiscal quarter.","General and administrative expenses totaled $55 million for the first quarter. This is above the run rate for our full year guidance due in large part to costs associated with our bond exchange. Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is also differed from the annual expected rate in Q1 predominantly due to a discrete income tax adjustment in Q1.","Summarizing the overall results of this quarter, H&P earned $0.17 per diluted share versus $0.02 in the previous quarter. First quarter income per share was adversely impacted by net $0.25 per share of select items as highlighted in our press release.","The two largest of these select items were: first a non-cash loss recognized on our legacy equity investments in two oil fields service companies which resulted from the adoption of an accounting standard update; and second, the settlement of an outstanding legal matter. Absent these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.42 in the first quarter versus an adjusted $0.19 during the fourth fiscal quarter.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $196 million, in line with our previous guidance that fiscal 2019 CapEx would be partly front loaded.","Turning to our four segments, beginning with US land segment. We exited the first fiscal quarter with 244 contracted rigs, which is an increase of approximately 5% in the number of active rigs quarter-to-quarter and equates to an approximate 22% US land market share. I will discuss in more detail in a moment, but we do expect rig count to moderately decline in the second fiscal quarter, with our super-spec class maintaining a mid-90% utilization level.","First fiscal quarter conditions continued to allow pricing improvements and excluding early termination revenue, our average rig revenue per day increased to $251,56 for the first quarter. The average rig expense per day increased to $15,433, due in large part to the aforementioned $21 million settlement of a legal matter, which resulted in the $18 million charge in Q1, or approximately $821 per day. Absent this charge, adjusted average rig expense per day was $14,622 which is towards the low end of our previously guided range.","Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 for US land, as we have previously stated, we are putting first and second fiscal quarter upgrades to work under term contracts, but simultaneously some spot rigs have also been released. We expect the net result will be a sequential decrease of approximately 3% to 5% in the quarterly number of revenue days, which translates to an average rig count of approximately 234 rigs during the second quarter.","Per my previous comment, we expect super-spec utilization to be in the mid-90 percentile range. Compared to the first quarter at $25,150 per day, we expect the adjusted average rate revenue per day to increase to a range from $25,500 to $26,000. The expected increase is driven in part by the rollover of term contracts at higher rates.","We are also experiencing the beginnings of customer adoption of our FlexApp offerings, which are approaching $250 per day in revenues across the fleet. The normalized average rig expense per day directly related to rigs working in the US land segment remains constant at $13,700 per day.","This per day figure excludes the impact of expenses directly related to inactive rigs, the idling of released rigs and the upfront reactivation expenses related to rigs that have been idle for a significant amount of time.","In accordance with prior guidance, the mid-point of the average rate expense per day is expected to be in a range now $14,700 to $15,100 for the second quarter, as we start up our contracted fiscal Q2 upgrades and incur expenses to stack released rigs. Note that as we reduce upgrades in the future quarters, upfront reactivation expenses will also come down, moving the average rig expense per day towards a normalized expense per day number of $13,700 over time.","We had an average of 149 active rigs under term contracts during the first quarter, and today, that number is 152, or about 64% of our 238 working rigs, as John had mentioned. We expect to continue to have an average of 149 rigs under term contract in the fiscal second quarter, earning an average margin of $11,500 per day.","For the average of the 131 rigs we will have remaining under term contract for the rest of 2019, we expect average margins to be roughly $12,000. For the 67 rigs that currently remain under term contract at fiscal 2020 the associated margin is $12,500.","We received $2.4 million in early termination revenue in the first quarter, which marked an end to our previously early terminated contracts. We are still assessing the early termination revenue impact from recent cancellations.","Turning to our offshore operations segment, we continued with six active rigs during the first fiscal quarter. However, as mentioned on our November call, one rig underwent approximately a 30 days of planned maintenance during the quarter, which reduced offshore revenue days by approximately 5%. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially due to that same rig maintenance project.","As we look towards the second quarter of fiscal '19 for the offshore segment, we have six of the eight offshore rigs contracted. Quarterly revenue days are expected to increase by 3% sequentially due to the completion of that aforementioned maintenance project, but there will be some offset by the lower number of days in the quarter. The average margin per day is expected to decline to a range of $6,000 to $7,000 during the second quarter as one rig is anticipated to be on standby rig for a period of time. ","Regarding our international land segment, the average rig margin per day in this segment increased by $4,213 to $12,871 in the first quarter. The increase was due primarily to two items: one, the absence of one-time cost incurred in the prior quarter to wind down Ecuadorian operations; and two, the recognition of a prior early termination payment pursuant to contractual terms.","As we look towards the second quarter of fiscal '19 for international, quarterly revenue days are expected to decrease approximately 10% as activity in Colombia softened with the recent decline in oil prices. We expect an average second quarter rig count of 17 to 18 active rigs in this segment.","Excluding the impact of early termination payments the average rig margin is expected to increase slightly to between $10,500 and $11,500 per day during the second quarter due to contractual price increases associated with certain rigs.","Now looking at our H&P Technologies segment. As John mentioned, our new H&P Technologies segment primarily consists of our recently acquired Motive and MagVar businesses. In addition, we are making significant research and development investments, which we believe will result in these services gain increased market share over time.","AutoSlide is a near-term example of a commercial offering. While we think adoption and penetration in the market will take some time, we are optimistic about the differentiation this can provide as well as the potential margin accretion of this service and others that will follow.","Now, let me look forward on corporate items for the remainder of the fiscal year. At fiscal year-end, our revenue backlog from our US land fleet was roughly $1.1 billion for rigs under term contract, which we define as rig contracts with original fixed terms of at least six months and that contain our early termination provisions. Our current revenue backlog for the US land fleet as of today's call is approximately $1.6 billion, which represents an increase of roughly $500 million since September 30.","Capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2019 year are expected to decrease from previous guidance by $150 million, to a range between $500 million to $530 million, based on market expectations today as opposed to the initial budget planning environment at the beginning of this fiscal year. As a reminder capital investment in our fleet is comprised of three distinct buckets.","Bucket one contains capital expenditures to upgrade and convert FlexRig's to super-spec capacity, and is now estimated to range between $175 million to $185 million. Much of this first bucket was front loaded in the first and second fiscal quarters. The second bucket consists of FlexRig capital maintenance and is now estimated to range between $165 million and $200 million. Capital maintenance typically averages between $750,000 to $1 million per active rig.","The third bucket of 2019 CapEx is comprised of two items; one, fiscal year 2019 catch up on bulk spare equipment purchases to support the increased scale of our super-spec fleet over the last two years; and two, higher capital rig activation cost due to the average idle time of a reactivated rig being closed to for years of stacking. This third bucket collectively will now range from $135 million to $170 million.","As John mentioned, our revised CapEx plan is in response to the moderation in demand resulting from the recent decline in commodity price levels. H&P works closely with our supply chain partners to be responsive to market conditions with respect to our upgrade opportunities. Reactivation CapEx is dependent on the upgrade cadence. Ending maintenance expenditures and certain bulk quantities will be correlated to our operating rig counts.","Despite the Q1 results, our general and administrative expenses for the full 2019 fiscal year are still expected to be flat from 2018, at approximately $200 million in total. In addition to the US statutory rate, we incur incremental state and foreign income taxes and we are now projecting our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 30%.","Now, looking at our financial position, Helmerich & Payne had cash and short-term investments of approximately $269 million at December 31, 2018. Including our expanded and extended revolving credit facility availability, our liquidity was approximately $980 million. In our revised fiscal 2019 plan, we will consume a small portion of our cash on hand.","Since the November call, we exchanged our outstanding bonds from our H&P Drilling subsidiary to the parent H&P incorporated level as part of a corporate restructuring that more closely aligns our entity structure with our operating segments. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's moved their applicable credit ratings to the parent level and affirmed our investment grade ratings.","Our debt-to-capital at quarter end was between 10% and 11%, the best-in-class measurement amongst our peer group. We have no debt maturity until 2025. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity level and term contract backlog provides H&P the flexibility to adapt to market conditions and maintain our long practice of returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.","That concludes our prepared comments for the first fiscal quarter 2019. Let me now turn the call over to Priscilla for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And will take a first question today from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Your line is open.","Tommy Moll","So, John, I wanted to start on the Technologies segment that you created during the quarter. Leadership in technology has been core to the H&P value proposition for a long, long time, but can you walk us through the strategy to go ahead and formalize this segment?","And then, on AutoSlide, you mentioned the plan to commercialize in the Midland Basin over the next few months. Could you give us some details on the ramp phase there and then, longer term, how big of an opportunity you see?","John Lindsay","Sure. You're right. We've had a long track record of innovation and utilizing technology to deliver higher levels of value for our customers. FlexRig was an example of that. With the H&P Technologies segment, it's primarily focused on digital and software technology solutions.","And there are some service elements to that as well, but it's primarily, like I said, a digital and software technology. And all of those are focused on delivering solutions that drive higher levels of value for our customers. And typically, a little bit different type of technology than what we would typically deliver with FlexRigs and with our traditional offering.","So, as we look at using Motive and MagVar as an example of wellbore quality and wellbore placement, but we also want H&P Technologies to focus on delivering those types of capabilities not only on FlexRigs, but we also want to make certain that those technologies are also able to be used on other rig platforms that allows our customers to utilize that single database, if you will, of information using Motive and MagVar as an example.","There will be other innovations and technology development in the future. We've got a technology roadmap that we continue to work on and develop. We won't be talking about those today, but all of those things are really directed towards delivering another level of value to the customer.","And I think in some respects, like I said in my prepared remarks, Motive and MagVar are - Motive particularly, is disruptive at the rig site because it changes the role at the rig a little bit. But I think at the end of the day, it's the right thing to do in this direction that we need to be heading.","As far as AutoSlide, we continue to have good results. We're still working with two customers on AutoSlide. We're working on, I want to say, four or five rigs today. And again, that's an autonomous sliding algorithm and essentially, where we've fully automated that sliding component when we're directional drilling and that's both in the vertical, drilling the curve and the lateral.","We still haven't reached full commercialization, but we believe that will happen in the next-month or so, in the next-month or two. We're seeing a lot of - again, a lot of good things that's going on with that. And again, I think it's a great opportunity for us ultimately to get to a more fully autonomous drilling platform.","Tommy Moll","And if I could ask one follow-up. Just in terms of the potential to differentiate in the volatile macro-environment we've experienced in recent weeks and months, you mentioned in the release yesterday that H&P package across both rigs and related technology continues to grow in importance as drilling becomes more and more complex.","On that point and if the last downturn proved anything, it was that customers increasingly wanted best-in-class execution and tech. So while we're nowhere near downturn today, the market certainly has taken a breather and I wondered if you could describe how that may present an opportunity for you guys to once again differentiate versus peers as customers squint closer and closer at cost efficiencies and service quality? And to put a even finer point on it, does it at all change - does the current environment at all change the commercial strategy for the H&P Technology portfolio? Thanks.","John Lindsay","Sure, Tommy. Well, there's no doubt that we're continuing to have a lot of traction with our FlexApps, so those Flex applications that we're deploying on the FlexRig digital platform and those are primarily focused on downhole and really allows downhole tools to last longer.","It's lowering risk for customers and lowering risk for our employees because we have downhole tools are lasting longer so we're tripping less also. Obviously, the performance is enhanced. So I think we're going to continue to see more adoption around the FlexApps.","There is no doubt in a softer market and as we described in our prepared remarks, a really higher volatility market related to oil prices, it's interesting because when you look back in 2012 and 2013, we experienced some similar soft spots if you will. They weren't full blown downturns, they were just a softening in the market.","And what we saw in that time was an opportunity for customers to high-grade their fleets and what you saw were a lot of the legacy fleet that continued to get displaced by higher-end AC rig technology both FlexRigs and competitor rigs.","I think in today's market with the types of wells that are being drilled, longer laterals, more complex, a lot on the line in terms of drilling these wells, you're going to continue to see the super-spec category of rigs, super-spec FlexRigs and other super-spec rigs high-grading the lower end of the AC food chain and continue to see legacy rigs that are going to get replaced.","So there's no doubt that in markets like this, it allows customers an opportunity to look at their fleet and decide how they want to segment their fleet. In some cases, rig counts aren't going to pull back, as I said, with some of our customers. The rig counts are going to remain the same, but they are going to high-grade their fleet and I think that's a great opportunity and that's one of the things that softer markets give us an opportunity to perform.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead","Thanks for all that color and your perspectives on the market dynamics. I'm curious though and my expectation might've been that even with a flat to a modestly declining rig count environment and a potential shift in spend by E&P companies, if there's going to be a shift in spend towards frac versus drilling, that E&Ps could still do more for their dollar by keeping super-spec rigs active or effectively not seeing a decline in super-spec rig activity. So I don't know maybe we can start there and give me your perspectives on your discussions with the E&Ps and if they're looking about dropping rigs why would they even think about dropping a super-spec rig at this point?","John Lindsay","I think the first thing to begin with, because it's a great question and I think one of the things you have to - that we all have to recognize is that there's always a certain amount of churn in our rig count. So, we're constantly getting rigs released and in even the strongest of markets because customers are making decisions spending within cash flow or look for whatever reasons are and you're going to see a certain amount of churn.","Now, clearly we've seen more churn in the last couple of months and we have rigs that have been released and we haven't had customers to pick those rigs up on. But when you start looking at how quickly oil prices have moved from 70s, down to low 40s, and now somewhere back in the low 50s again, I think what that causes is some rigs are going to be released because some customers again have a certain budget related to the cash flows they are generating.","I think in general as you think about the - which is obviously very important, the pricing element, fundamentally, we still have a very strong market, even though there is some super-spec availability, the super-spec utilization of our fleet today is mid-90%s even with additional releases that are coming over the next couple of weeks, we're still at 90% utilization.","So pricing we believe is going to remain strong and we think again there's going to be some additional pullback in activity, but with a strong value proposition, with a strong utilization of the super-spec fleet and with as hard as we've all worked to get pricing to the levels that they are today, again, I think fundamentally pricing is going to remain firm.","I think in addition to that, Kurt, I think the rig releases are a result of an expectation in some cases that oil was going to be much lower than where it is today. And so again I think it's an opportunity for us as industry participants to figure out how we're going to work in this more volatile oil price environment. I don't think anybody wants to do the stop and start mentality, where your land rig is down, you're picking Rick's back up.","So, I think, there's going to have to be some balance in there. But as I said earlier, I think in this softer market, it gives customers an opportunity once the dust settles on, where they think the oil prices are going, or their budgets are going to be and I think it's an opportunity for them to high -grade their fleets.","Kurt Hallead","So, in the context of the current market environment, maybe how things might have shifted over the course of the past-month or so, are you getting a sense more broadly or getting some unsolicited feedback from your customer base that there's some drillers out there that have panicked a little bit and offering a larger discount on pricing than really needs to be done at this point?","John Lindsay","Kurt, I think there's always - in the market there's always a certain amount of rumors and there's usually someone who won't maintain a certain level of discipline or panic. Honestly, the rumors that we hear, most of those are related to much smaller drilling contractors and the lower end of the fleet profile, is the feedback that we've gotten. I don't get an impression that the larger peers with the higher specification rigs are doing that.","Again, let's go back to what I began with, which - on the pricing, which is fundamentally, there's no reason for pricing to drop today with the utilization of mid-90%s, and we think it's going to go utilization of 90%. Historically speaking, when you see a utilization of a segment in our rig fleet at 75% to 80%, you begin to get pricing power.","So I just don't think that that's going to be the case and the fact is, we don't have any way to verify some of the pricing because we don't provide rigs in that lower end of the legacy rig fleet.","Operator","We'll move next to Brad Handler with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bradley Handler","Can you tell us about the upgrade cadence in the second quarter, and the visibility you have for the third quarter, please?","John Lindsay","And you're talking second fiscal quarter?","Bradley Handler","Fiscal yes.","John Lindsay","Well, as we said on our last call, our expectation, our outlook, if the demand was there, we would upgrade approximately 12 rigs a quarter in Q1 and Q2, and we actually upgraded 14 in Q1. We estimate that we'll upgrade eight in Q2.","As Mark described with our reduction in CapEx what we expect now is, and this is with an asterisk, assuming on the demand side if the demand is there for additional upgrades in Q3 and Q4 or just in Q3, we have the capacity to do four to six more upgrades. And again, it's just going to be a function of whether we get the demand from the customer base for that.","Mark Smith","Just to add, Brad, that's four to six for the fiscal third and fourth quarters combined and that would be skewed towards the walking rig capability.","Bradley Handler","Okay. So 14 plus eight plus five is where your heads at today in terms of the total upgrades for the year?","Mark Smith","That's right.","Bradley Handler","Now, let's see, so in your comments yesterday, you allowed - I recognize how hard this is by the way, or well, I probably don't even appreciate how hard it is, but I recognize it. But you said you might exit as low as 223 rigs operating. It sounds like you were - that's not your best guess though, right, the 234, I haven't done the math right, the 234 that you just said seems to suggest that you think it hangs in better than that?","John Lindsay","Yes. Brad, I think the way to - you're right. It's not easy to predict the future, and what we have are a lot of data points. And by the way, this is all again underlined by we have an expectation that oil is going to remain in the low 50s, and if that's the case, I would agree with you. I don't think we're going to reach that lower end of the spectrum, but you have to give that range because you don't know for sure what commodity price is going to do.","As I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing less - we're seeing fewer releases and we're having customers asking about rig availability in March and April and startup plans for March and April. So, in that environment, we would think that we're going to be on the higher end of the spectrum, but I think it's our responsibility to give you that range. If oil doesn't - if oil isn't as strong as what we're thinking right now, than we've got you give you some of that downside range, but our bet would be on the higher end of the expectation.","Bradley Handler","And I appreciate that. And I guess maybe just sort of one more for me, maybe a little more about the customer conversation. With a lot of the customer conversation in January, did it sound something like, we don't know, come back in a month, and we'll probably have a much better sense of what we doing? Or was it more definitive than that, but somewhat more negative and little bit more positive or sanguine? I'm just curious maybe about the level of - just we have no idea, we are still working on our budget versus it's forming and this is what it looks like?","Mark Smith","I think it's really a mix. As I've said, again, in the prepared remarks, some are going to increase, some are going to decrease and some are going to remain flat. Clearly, there's still in the formative stages of putting budgets together. Again I think as you look at E&P commentary in general, everyone is struggling with the same thing, which is, what are oil prices going to be, and just how volatile can they be, so how do we base our budget?","I think there ultimate ends up being some real-time element to this budgeting process. I've seen some customers that have talked about well of oils $50 to $55, this is our range of $55 to $60, all the way up to $70 to $75. I think that makes a lot of sense right, because you've got to be able to flex up and flex back in order to respond to the market and still be able to spend within your cash flow.","So I know it's not a direct answer, but I know there's a lot of solutions that are being formulated. The great news for us at H&P is that, we have a strong customer base. 80% of our rigs that are working today are working for publicly traded E&Ps that have strong balance sheet, that have good acreage positions. It's not that we're not interested in working for the privates, because we are and we do have a lot more rigs working for privates today than we ever have in the past, but the majority of the rigs that are actually working are with the larger public E&Ps.","Operator","We'll move next to Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open.","Marc Bianchi","I guess just to follow-up on the last conversation about the exit rate and rig count. And if oil prices stabilize here, it seems like you could be bottoming HP in terms of your rig count on an average share in this quarter. Would you suspect that that's the case for the broader rig count, or do you think you're taking share?","John Lindsay","Well, we know we've picked up some - a little bit of incremental share over the last month maybe. I do think that again different reports that you read a lot of the discussion on the rig releases that have been announced are on the legacy side of the fleet and a lot of the smaller E&Ps, and I think probably a lot of the smaller contractors.","Historically, speaking I would think that, we're in a position to continue to capture market share because of the types of wells that are being drilled. And so we're making an assumption; one, that oil prices remain in the low 50s; and two, that customers continue to drill the more complex type wells, and now they have access to an idle super-spec FlexRig that just became idle, that can start up in a moment's notice and go back to work. So that would be our thought.","Again back to running the numbers and trying to look at our number of rigs that have been re-leased and look at our market share and if in fact the pundits are right about 100 to 200, and I think we would pick up market share in that environment.","Marc Bianchi","Well if the super-spec rate is firm as you're suggesting, you do have still I think some benefit of contract rolls, so rigs that are coming off, pricing that was maybe set a year ago or year and half ago, rolling to what I think is a higher level today. Mark or John, can you speak to what that should do to the margin assuming super-spec rates remain flat from here? How much of a tailwind is that over the next couple of quarters? Anyway you can give us some help on that would be great.","Mark Smith","Sure, Mark, I think maybe we even mentioned in the prepared comments, the increase that we're expecting sequentially moving from the first to the second fiscal quarters does include rollover as you alluded to. It's really worth what's baked into the guidance we release yesterday in the press release. We just had coincidentally a couple of large customer contracts that were tied to a calendar year end and we're starting to benefit from that rollover in the current pricing environment.","Marc Bianchi","So would you say that the sequential change that you've guided to here in the - for the second quarter is maybe higher than what we would see in subsequent quarters just because of that year end issue?","Mark Smith","Yes. It's rollover $700 to $800 and it will level out there as we see in the clouded crystal ball as I like to say.","Marc Bianchi","Right. Well one more then for your clouded crystal ball. On the OpEx side, you had mentioned eventually getting back to that 13.7. If activity is more flattish here than maybe prior expectations, is there any way you could put a timeline on getting there for us?","Mark Smith","Not a definitive timeline, but as John said, if our read of the commodity price and customer sentiment is correct and we do in fact, have the bottom of the rig count, either occurring right now or just behind us, and we don't have necessarily an appreciable increase, we'll stay at the four to six rig cadence for the - in total, I should say, for the third and fourth fiscal quarters.","So if you consider that, as John mentioned, we're going to have eight rigs coming out in the second quarter, the difference between our normalized rig expense per day and the average rig expense per day includes those things for - related to inactive rigs, idling released rigs and reactivating rigs. The reactivation bit has been the higher part of that differential and that will obviously come off more quickly.","Again, if we're again towards the bottom, if you will, of the rig count, the idling of rigs will stop. So we'll simply be left with really a bit a few hundred dollars a day roughly really two legacy idle rig maintenance.","Operator","We will take our next question from Colin Davies with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Colin Davies","I'd like to try and get a little bit more clarity and detail around this transition to the guide on rig counts at the end of this quarter. I mean if I look at the mid-point of the guidance, it looks like something like 16 net rigs coming off and if we've got eight rigs coming in from the upgrades, it looks like something like 24ish potentially effectively coming off contract or being dropped. In reference to the previous discussion, how much of that is existing super-spec's or Flex3s that haven't been upgraded or just other rigs?","John Lindsay","75% are super-spec. Did you hear that Colin? Of the 24, about 75% are super-spec. As you can imagine, our largest fleet is our Flex3 super-spec fleet. So that would be - I don't think any - I don't think there's any 5s in there. I think they are all 3s that are all maybe one - so that are all Flex3s that were in the spot market. So, that's --","Mark Smith","And it's the same rig that John was mentioning as we look through to the prospects of the sequential quarters, that's March and April interest that we can gauge into this. And further afield, those are - that gives an opportunity to consider scale our international opportunities to move rigs as John mentioned, so we are looking at several different things to concur.","Colin Davies","So follows on actually to my next question. Just on international, I think, in the prepared remarks you referred to perhaps some encouraging signs, Middle East Argentine, but I think in the release Colombia was down. What are you hearing from customers and perhaps contrast that what you're hearing on budgets on the U.S. side versus perhaps what some people are saying is most stable budgets internationally? And perhaps run through the countries a little bit and tell us what you're seeing?","John Lindsay","Well, the work - and you had mentioned Colombia, the work in Colombia is shorter-term work and we were a little surprised that the rigs were released. I think some of those rigs will go back to work in 2019. As far as the Argentina, Argentina really shouldn't be too much of a surprise, in that, we've got a nice footprint. I think we've got 35% of the horizontal market down there and there's continued opportunity.","And we've heard a need for super-spec capacity in Argentina. And so, logically, with the capacity that we have on the ground with Flex3 super-spec then those are logical candidates. If you recall back in 2013, we sent 10 Flex3s with skid systems to Argentina, and those rigs were available because we had that soft pullback if you will come as a result of commodity prices.","Middle East in general, I'm really not in the position to talk about specific countries, but in general what we've seen over, I would say, the last several weeks, maybe just in January, we've started to see some inquiries coming in related to opportunities, and still don't have a real good handle on the scale, but again I think; number one, it's encouraging; number two, it's an opportunity to place assets that have recently been idled in the U.S.","These are unconventional - best we can tell, these are unconventional type opportunities, so has a nice fit with both our skill set as well as the rigs that we have in the fleet.","Operator","And will move next to Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Scott Gruber","I just want to circle back on the outlook for the new Tech segment, since we have a new segment to model here. John, can you provide some color on how we should think about growth for the segment over the medium-term? If we think out, say, to the end of fiscal 2019, where could the top line rise to? I know, there's always uncertainties especially with new products, but some color there will be great even if you just want to provide a wide range of outcomes.","John Lindsay","Scott, I think at this stage it's hard to give a financial type forecast. Again, we're in an adoption mode as you know. We continue to grow both Motive and MagVar, and then, we also have the commercialization of AutoSlide. And so, all of that great potential, but it is very hard to get your arms around what's the growth profile. Mark, do you have\u2026","Mark Smith","Well, yes, we do expect - it's still relatively small in relation to the overall Company, but it's reaching a level for materiality which is part of our considerations in this segment. We do expect the operating losses to narrow as these business technologies do begin to really get some traction as John discussed in his prepared comments. But with the pending commercialization of AutoSlide in the near term and for other competitive reasons, we are not going to give near projections at this time.","Scott Gruber","That's fine. I understand. Can you talk a little bit just about how we should think about, how the cost structure flexes with the revenue growth? I imagine the incremental should be pretty good, but I just don't have a clear picture on how you guys think about the R&D component and then how the more direct OpEx flexes with revenues?","Mark Smith","For the Technologies segment specifically?","Scott Gruber","Yes.","Mark Smith","Yes. It's very margin accretive, the software business essentially.","Scott Gruber","So we should be thinking very high incrementals, 50%, 60%, 70%?","Mark Smith","Yes. Let's say, high incremental margins, but remember, we are still investing through R&D expense. So, through the near to medium term at a minimum those unit margins won't drop straight to the bottom line for the segment if you will, because you have R&D in the middle and the geography on the income statement.","Scott Gruber","And then I just noticed that the G&A expense is healthy. I know there's probably a big marketing effort around the Technologies, but any color in terms of that line within this segment? How will that trend?","Mark Smith","That should be flat as we move forward. Yes, there have been some initial investments in getting the segment stood up, if you will, and combining the previously acquired companies over the trailing 18 months related to some of the - some cost around the acquisition, we have some amortizing cost and G&A but it should be flat. As we have said the company's overall G&A for this year is going to be flat compared to prior year, Technologies fits in that overall guidance.","Scott Gruber","And then one last one for me Mark. As I look at the reactivation and bulk spending budget - bucket of CapEx, obviously there is a big component there that's not ongoing. Obviously the CapEx related to the reactivation program will fade over time but as I think about that bucket specifically into 2020 there seems to be at least a portion that should be ongoing in terms of some of the larger items and maybe it's lumpy but just how do we think about that bucket beyond 2019 assuming some flattish level of rig reactivity?","Mark Smith","I think it's really as we said a one-time catch-up. When we go from just over the course of a couple of years from an average of two pumps per rig with an average of 3, you go from an average of 18,000 feet of tubular complement to 22,000 feet in more per rig which sort of end of catch-up. Once you have that - once we have those component fixed assets and the systems then we put them through the regular overhaul in maintenance routine that gets to the $750,000 to $1 million per rig on an ongoing basis.","Scott Gruber","So there wasn't any pipe catch-up - pipe spending catch-up as you consumed inventory if this at all related to the step up in pipe for rig?","Mark Smith","Step up, yes.","Operator","Thank you. And that is all the time what we have for Q&A today. I\u2019ll turn the call back to John Lindsay for closing remarks.","John Lindsay","Okay. Thank you, Priscilla. And again thanks to everyone for your interest in H&P, and a big thanks to all of our loyal and hard-working employees the company around the world for working safely, for focus on vehicle safety, and enabling our value proposition for our customers. So thank you again and everyone have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."],"11006":["Helmerich and Payne, Inc.

It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Mr. Dave Wilson, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Wilson","Thank you, Lynn, and welcome, everyone, to Helmerich & Payne's Conference Call and Webcast corresponding to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Juan Tardio, Vice President and CFO. John and Juan Pablo will be sharing some comments with us. After which, we'll open the call for questions.","As you know, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. We will be - we will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculation in today's press release.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. The new tax law had a significant and positive but noncash impact on our income this quarter. Better still, the H&P team executed on our plans, delivered on the value proposition to our customers, and operational results exceeded expectations in the first fiscal quarter.","The downturn has been a challenging three-year journey, and H&P has been preparing for the opportunity this improved outlook presents for 2018 and beyond. There are three main areas I'd like to highlight this morning. First is the industry-leading success we've had in upgrading our FlexRig fleet to super-spec in order to provide the right rig for our customers. Second, the pricing power we are seeing as a result of the performance the FlexRig super spec fleet is delivering, which is the reason customers are willing to pay for the value proposition. The third highlight I will cover is the digital evolution that continues to be an important part of our industry's future and the fact that we are a leader in utilizing data to deliver performance.","The recent motive in MagVAR acquisitions during 2017 create powerful software platforms that will position us to be even more successful going forward. So let's begin with the industry's super-spec fleet being essentially fully utilized in U.S. land with approximately 400 rigs active today. We define super-spec rigs as AC drive, 1,500-horsepower, 750,000-pound hook load, pad capability and 7,500-psi mud systems. H&P currently has 171 super-spec rigs operating at approximately 98% utilization. We believe there are another 200 to 250 rigs in the industry where upgrades to super-spec capacity would be economically feasible, and H&P owns roughly half of those.","Of our upgradable fleet, approximately 30 FlexRigs are currently active today and can be upgraded to super-spec status in the field with a $2 million to $3 million investment. The FlexRig design allows H&P to reinvest in our fleet to enhance rig capabilities that will benefit our customers in the areas that require well designs which are more challenging and complex. In fact, since the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we have upgraded 107 FlexRigs to super-spec capacity. If customer demand remains and we're able to achieve reasonable pricing, our upgrade cadence could average 12 or more FlexRig upgrades per quarter.","The key takeaway here is that H&P is uniquely positioned to grow its active rig count without building new rigs, whether that be under improved commodity pricing or the range-bound pricing we've experienced most of this past year. This successful strategy has allowed us to grow market share from 15% to 20% in the U.S. land fleet and over 30% in the AC drive market.","But not every customer needs a super-spec rig, and we continue to contract previously idled rigs as well. Our ongoing effort to provide the right rig from our family of solutions for our customers enables H&P to serve a wider segment of the market and further enhances market share.","The second point I want to make is that pricing in U.S. land is led by super-spec rigs, and the main driver in rig pricing today is the near full utilization of the high-capacity super-spec U.S. land rig fleet. The primary reason customers want super-spec rigs is the fact that lateral lengths have increased to the extent that this is pushing the limits of the standard AC drive rig fleet.","In fact, in 2017, the average lateral increased another 15% to approximately 8,000 feet, and we expect this trend of longer laterals to continue. As a reference point, the average lateral in 2015 was approximately 6,000 feet. H&P has over 40% of the active super-spec rigs, and with the industry fleet fully utilized, we expect to be able to continue to realize pricing improvements. Again, the potential for margin expansion, coupled with our having approximately 100 rigs readily upgradable to super-spec status, gives the company excellent prospects for continued growth going forward.","The super-spec classification FlexRig provides the rig capability needed for the more complex and long lateral wells. Delivering on the performance and reliability required today means having the right data and technology that are crucial to maximize value for our customers.","The final topic I'd like to highlight is that we are making great strides toward becoming a bigger participant in the industry's digital evolution. For the past 10 years, our uniform fleet of AC drive FlexRigs has enabled us to utilize high-speed data generated from the rig and leverage IOT tools to enhance efficiencies and reliability. The MOTIVE Drilling Technologies and MagVAR acquisitions in 2017 create powerful complementary software platforms and compelling opportunities for E&P companies. Both technologies are designed to deliver real-time actionable results and enable enhanced collaboration for on and off rig site teams for our very time-sensitive industry.","MOTIVE and MagVAR are technology leaders in their respective space, and these technologies provide additional value for our customers through improved wellbore quality in placement while offering the flexibility to utilize these services regardless of the drilling contractor or directional drilling company. These acquisitions add an attractive dimension to our strategic vision and further differentiate us from others in the market.","The MOTIVE and MagVAR technology and service offerings don't compete in the traditional directional drilling and downhole tool space, although both companies provide software and services to E&Ps and directional drilling companies.","MOTIVE's Bit Guidance System has unique directional drilling software technology that uses cognitive computing to provide optimized steering decision automation for the directional driller. MOTIVE has commercially drilled in excess of 350 wells and over 4.75 million feet of wellbore.","MagVAR's technology helps operators achieve optimal well placement and unconventional field development which leads to improved hydrocarbon extraction for the target reservoir. MagVAR leverages enhanced geomagnetic referencing and specialized data analytics and real-time to improve MWD survey accuracy which, in turn, improves the customer's capability to drill longer lateral wellbores within geological and reservoir targets.","During the 2017 December quarter, MagVAR provided correction services for more than 600 wells, up from approximately 270 wells in the same quarter in 2016. We've been very pleased with the integration of both companies not only to technology, but especially their people. Their great synergies and their cultures match well with H&P.","Before turning the call to Juan Pablo, I want to emphasize that we believe that our people, performance, technology, reliability and our uniform FlexRig fleet remain our strongest competitive advantages. Coupled with our scale and financial strength, we are able to continue to provide superior value to customers and shareholders.","And now, I'll turn the call to Juan Pablo.","Juan Tardio","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I will expand on some of the announced information on each of our three drilling segments followed by some comments on corporate level details. On our U.S. land drilling segment, let me first highlight some of the details related to our growth and activities during the last few months. Since our last earnings call in November 16, 2017, our activity has increased by six rigs. The Permian again led the way with four rigs along with minor up-and-down movements in other basins. Our three most active basins today are,, The Permian, the SCOOP and STACK play and the Eagle Ford. The Permian remains our most active operation with 102 rigs contracted. We still have 46 idle FlexRigs in the area, 25 of which have 1,500-horsepower drawworks rating.","In the SCOOP and STACK and Eagle Ford today, we have 30 and 31 rigs contracted coming off a low of 15 and 16 contracted rigs, respectively. As for the overall U.S. land segment results corresponding to the first fiscal quarter, we exited the period with 204 contracted rigs and had an increase of approximately 4% in total quarterly revenue days. We continued to experience growth in activity from beginning to end of the quarter and now expect a similar trend for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.","In general, the improved level of pricing in the spot market more than offset the decreasing proportion of rigs under long-term contracts that were priced years ago during strong markets. As a result, the adjusted average rig revenue per day increased by $483 to $22,167 during the most recent quarter.","The average rig expense per day decreased by $359 to $13,546, mostly driven by lower-than-expected self-insurance expenses in the quarter as we adjusted our corresponding reserves.","Looking ahead at the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect a sequential increase of approximately 3% to 4% in the average number of active rigs. Compared to the prior quarter at $22,167 per day, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to remain relatively flat to slightly up as the underlying dynamics of newbuild term contract roll-offs and increasing spot pricing continue to offset one another.","Although our average day rate in the spot market is still in the high-teens, leading edge super-spec FlexRig pricing is in the low to mid-20s. The average rig expense per day level is expected to be roughly $13,900. The normalized average rig expense per day directly related to rigs that are already working in the U.S. line segment continues to be around $13,000 per day. This general estimate excludes the impact of expenses directly related to inactive rigs and upfront reactivation expenses related to rigs that have been idle for a significant amount of time.","109 of our 206 contracted rigs today are under term contracts, and 38 of the 109 rigs under term contracts were priced during strong markets before the 2014 downturn. The remaining rigs under term contracts were priced since the downturn and have a remaining average duration of less than one year. The expected average rig margin per day for all of our rigs already under term contracts in this segment during the second fiscal quarter is roughly $10,500. The expected average rig margin per day numbers for rigs already under term contract for the second half of fiscal 2018, for all of fiscal 2019 and for all of fiscal 2020 are roughly $10,300, $12,100 and $15,400, respectively.","The average number of corresponding rigs that we already have under term contracts for each of those 3 time period is approximately as follows, 83 for the second half of fiscal 2018, 35 for fiscal 2019 and 8 for fiscal 2020.","No early termination notices for rigs in the segment have been received since mid-2016, but given the prior terminations, we expect the generate approximately $4 million during the second fiscal quarter and a total of approximately $6 million during the following three quarters in early termination revenues.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. The number of quarterly revenue days decreased by approximately 6% with five rigs contracted through the quarter. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially by $287 to $12,375. Management contracts contributed approximately $6.5 million through operating income, benefiting from adjustments that are not expected to recur during the following quarter.","As we look at the second quarter of fiscal 2018, quarterly revenue days are expected to decrease by approximately 2% with five rigs contracted during the quarter. Average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to $11,500 as one rig will be moving from an operating rate to a standby-type day rate for a few months. We are working on prospects for two idle rigs to go back to work during this fiscal year and are certainly encouraged by that possibility. Management contracts are expected to contribute approximately $4 million to the quarter's operating income.","Moving on to our international land operations. The average rig margin per day in the segment decreased by $1,035 to $11,351. Both sequential quarters included favorable adjustments that are not expected to recur going forward. The number of quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by 23% as a result of increased activity in Argentina, as mentioned during our prior call.","As we look at the second quarter of fiscal 2018, quarterly revenue days are expected to slightly declined by about 4% as we have two rigs immobilized during the first fiscal quarter, after the completion of the corresponding projects. Nevertheless, one of those rigs is contracted and scheduled to go back to work for a different customer early in the third fiscal quarter.","In addition, we are working on another opportunity that could resolve in one additional rig returning to work before the end of the second fiscal quarter. Accordingly, we would not be surprised to end the quarter with 18 active rigs in the segment, including 16 in Argentina, one in Colombia and one in Bahrain. The average rig margin per day is expected to be approximately $8,000.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. We expect an increasing level of activity and opportunities to upgrade FlexRig3 to specifications in highest demand and have adjusted our CapEx estimates accordingly to $350 million. Roughly 40% of that estimate is attributable to maintenance CapEx, including tubulars. As previously announced, and mentioned by John, we acquired another small company, MagVAR, during the first fiscal quarter. This acquisition is not included in our CapEx estimate. Our balance sheet, liquidity level and term contract backlog remain strong and provide great flexibility to pursue plenty of opportunities while, at the same time, sustaining current dividend levels. Our estimate for general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 increased to $180 million. The increase estimate is primarily a result of higher-than-expected year-end employee incentive compensation compared to the corresponding prior estimates and accruals, along with expenses related to our most recent acquisition, including restricted stock awards as announced in early December.","The new income tax law is expected to significantly benefit our future financial earnings and after-tax cash flows, which, of course, is what drives the required and favorable adjustment to our deferred income tax liability. Excluding that adjustment, our net income for the first fiscal quarter was very close to zero. And when the denominator for a rate calculation is so low year-to-date, it is not useful to refer to any expected income tax rate estimate for the rest of the fiscal year. Nevertheless, the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate for our 2018 fiscal year, given our September 30 year end, is approximately 25% and is expected to move to 21% for our 2019 fiscal year.","In addition to those statutory rates, of course, there are state and foreign income taxes to consider. We would not be surprised if we have a total blended statutory income tax rate of around 25% during fiscal 2019 and beyond.","Let me now turn the call back to John.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo. We are encouraged by an improving macro outlook for oil prices and the prospect of an increasing level of rig activity that it pertains. It is gratifying to see that many of the strategies we employ to prepare for this eventual increase in demand are bearing fruit as we have redeployed rigs to the field. Our fleet is particularly well-suited for the more technically challenging wells being drilled today. We believe there will be an accelerated bifurcation in the rig count as the rig replacement cycle persists.","Before we open up for questions, I want to take a moment to say that our thoughts and prayers are with those individuals, their families and friends who were impacted by the gas well blowout and explosion that happened earlier this week here in Oklahoma. Although it was not our rig that experienced this event, as a company in the oil and gas industry, I know we all strive to work safely each and every day. It is something that's top of mind for anyone in this line of work. This situation is a tragedy and a reminder for all of us that life is precious.","And Lynn, we will now open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Colin Davies with Bernstein Research.","Colin Davies","Just sort of thinking about all the activity in the Permian. And a lot of conversation around the underlying cost base of the industry. I noticed the sort of direct expense comments in the prepared remarks was sort of keeping things around that 13,000 level. How is it looking on the ground in the Permian? Are you experiencing inflation and pressure to that?","John Lindsay","I think there's always some inflation. We haven't really seen it bear out in our results right now. As you said, the average working rig is still around 13,000 but we have a lot of moving parts and pieces related to the number of rig activations and those sorts of things. Juan Pablo, would - anything to add there?","Juan Tardio","No. I don't believe that there are any significant adjustments that we might be expecting or any pressures that are worth mentioning or significant.","Colin Davies","Yes. And then just a more strategic follow-up. The strategy that you outlined around the digital impact and evolution of the industry seems quite distinctive perhaps from what some others are doing, much more sort of open-source strategy. But such against that, as the industry grows, there's clearly an object to try and capture more of the direct spread cost, if you like, of running the rigs through the drill - the well construction process. Can you just perhaps just take a step back and perhaps differentiate your approach from perhaps some of the other approaches that are out there and how you see your approach translating into capturing that spread?","John Lindsay","Yes. I think one thing, Colin, is our goal - I mean, at the end of the day, our goal is all designed to support our customer and to support the performance at the rig site, obviously. And so from an integrated perspective, I don't really see us necessarily looking at - to that particular avenue. I think when you start thinking about the - how we've utilized data, I kind of mentioned this in our comments over the last 10 years, I mean, we've utilized - with AC drive technology, our Center of Excellence here in Tulsa and our ability to utilize that data to enhance our performance for our customers, also to use tools that allow us to maintain our equipment in a more effective way to predict failures, to do things that are, I think, outside of what the typical drilling contractor has been able to do. Obviously, with MOTIVE and MagVAR, both of those technologies, they're different offerings, to your point.","They're different in what our peers and others are doing because one is related to bit guidance in general, which enhances the capability of the directional driller on the rig. We've seen for a long, long time that a poor directional driller or an inexperienced, that's probably the best way to describe it, an experienced directional driller, can really damage our value proposition for the customer. So the ability to more automate that and give that directional driller and ultimately, our driller, when you get to the point where you can eliminate the directional driller off of the rig floor or off of the - I have a driller's cabin, offside, I guess, I should say. And so we're giving turn-by-turn instructions to that DD, ultimately to a driller, hopefully at some in time in the future, no different than other industries, you get to the point where you can automate that function. So I think that's compelling.","And then I think with MagVAR, the ability to real-time autocorrect or correct surveys. MWD surveys, whether it's a survey tool or whether there's geomagnetic interference, different processes that companies use on surveys and being able to correct that survey is vitally important. And particularly, as you think about these laterals getting longer, one-degree or two-degree error on a 10,000-foot laterals are much different outcome that in a 5,000-foot lateral. So there's things like that, that are, I think, are compelling. And I think they're compelling to customers. It's kind of hard for me to exactly compare that with what all the other peers and competitors are doing, but I do think that we're in a great place to help our customers going forward.","Colin Davies","That's great. And just to follow up on that thought. As we think ahead for the next couple of years, are you seeing HP getting more active in those sort of technology bolt-on acquisition space? Do you see more coming?","John Lindsay","Well, let's put it this way. We've got our eyes open. We're looking for opportunities. We've said for a long time that it didn't make sense for H&P. We thought there was a dilutive effect to us acquiring other company's drilling rigs. We think having a uniform fleet of FlexRigs, 3s, 4s and 5s, is a significant competitive advantage. So we didn't expect to see us looking at that type of acquisition. And so the technology acquisitions makes sense. Again, we've talked about that for a long period of time. And I think the way to summarize is the technology that would enhance the performance for our customers, improve wellbore placement, quality, production and all of those things. I think customers would be willing to pay us to get a return on the investments that we're making.","Operator","Our next question comes from Byron Pope from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron Pope","John, could you, in a qualitative way, just give a feel for how the nature of your conversations with customers might be evolving with regard to their recognition to term out upgraded FlexRigs just given the tightness of the super-spec rig market today?","John Lindsay","Yes. I think there are some interest in terming up rigs. I think you heard in our prepared remarks and you've just kind of seen it over the last several quarters that we've got a pretty good mix of term and spot pricing. It's essentially 50-50 today. We've also been pretty adamant about not continuing to do super-spec upgrades without some sort of a term commitment and better pricing because I think that's important. And the last thing we want to do is overbuild the super-spec segment. It's hard to get your arms around exactly what - how large that segment should be. We know it's around 400-or-so, maybe a little more than 400. We know what the additional upgradable rigs. So I think there is some appetite for customers looking at term. I know for H&P, we have a high appetite for wanting to enter into more term contracts as we go forward as we upgrade these rigs.","Byron Pope","And I'm assuming it'd be reasonable to assume that the leading edge day rates that Juan Pablo referred to in his remarks would be representative of what we could expect for those upgraded super-spec FlexRigs?","John Lindsay","Yes. I think that's a reasonable expectation.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Daniel with Simmons & Company.","John Daniel","I'm going to just touch on offshore and international. First with international, can you just speak to customer increase right now? I know you alluded to potentially two rigs going back to work. But just given the recovery in oil prices, what are you seeing?","John Lindsay","Yes. I think in general, with the kind of the oil prices that we're seeing today, it's not that surprising that we're starting to see some interest. And so it's encouraging, like Juan Pablo said, to have a couple of rigs on the horizon offshore. International, as you know, international markets move pretty slowly. We have participated in a few tenders. We do have some conversations going on. Unlike U.S. land, those reactivations typically - or contract awards don't happen in a week or two, and you have rigs moving in 2 or 3 weeks. They're longer lead. But it is encouraging that we are beginning to see some interest and some discussions ongoing. So anything to add there?","Juan Tardio","I think that captures it.","John Daniel","And when you are participating on these tenders, can you just speak directionally to where the - those that win the tenders, where the margins are shaking out? And Juan Pablo, should we expect any type of reactivation or mode costs? Or is that embedded in that - the guidance for the $8,000 cash margin?","Juan Tardio","Yes. We have included some assumptions related to that in the margin outlook that we've provided. But as you know, there may be unexpected moving pieces related to putting rigs back to work. We don't expect those to be significantly detrimental to the margins. Hopefully, they're favorable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS.","Angeline Sedita","So John, based on your customer conversations that you had, and obviously, you've been here for many years. You know the industry. So thoughts about the rig count growth we could see for the industry in 2018. How many rigs do you think we could be adding by year-end this year? Is it 100? Is it 200? Are we exiting the year at 1,000 rigs or slightly above? I mean, what are you hearing and what are you feeling at this point in the year?","John Lindsay","Yes. That's a great question. I wish I had a crystal ball to look into to know for sure. I know you've heard us say that our belief for the last couple of fortress is that the rig count that we've been experiencing was kind of an expectation of $45 to $50 oil. And now, again, I think oil prices have probably exceeded everyone's expectation this early in 2018. And so if we're looking at a $60 or $65 oil price going forward, I think we're - we can logically expect to see customers pick some rigs up. What's interesting is there are so many variables in that and in that decision. I think first of all, one thing to keep in mind is that there is a lot of evidence for higher levels of discipline for E&Ps in terms of spending within cash flow.","So I think that's one factor. Service costs, clearly, are going to go up. I think with the budget increases that we've seen thus far, again, I think that probably gives kind of a moderate sort of rig count increase, which is what we would expect. But you've got other variables like rig efficiency, type of wells that are going to be drilled. What does the legacy fleet ultimately do? Because obviously, we're all focused on AC drive. I think there's around 225 legacy rigs drilling horizontal and directional wells today. That's down from 250 a few months ago. So we're seeing some sort of a - potentially seeing a trend there. So there's a lot of moving parts and pieces. It's hard to say, is it 100 rigs? Is it a 200-rig increase? And then again, I think you have to answer the question, what type of wells are they to be? If they're going to be longer laterals and more complex in tiger spacing on pads, I think you have to believe that you're going to need super-spec capacity rigs. And that capacity, overall, is somewhat limited, as we've described.","Angeline Sedita","So then, if anything, you would say, it's on the lighter end of that range. I mean, to be closer to 100 rigs than the 200 rigs based on all those factors. Is that fair?","John Lindsay","You know what, Angie, it's just hard to say. I mean, obviously, in a very strong - again, we've been in this business for a long time. And in a very strong commodity price improvement, rigs are going to go to work, and they may not be the ideal rigs for the projects. Eventually, we can get around to doing that. So I think it's hard to say. I think 100 and 200 rigs is a reasonable estimate. I think it's as reasonable as anybody could make.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens.","Thomas Moll","So the first question for you is just making sure that I'm understanding the CapEx budget correctly. On the revised number of $350 million, if we just ballpark the growth and maintenance, I'm getting to, call it, $200 million for growth this year. And then, John, you mentioned on the cadence of super-spec upgrades, it could be about 12 per quarter. So if we just ballpark $200 million on 50 upgrades, call it, $4 million per upgrade, am I thinking about that the right way? Or is there something else baked into the growth number?","Juan Tardio","Tommy, this is Juan Pablo. As we've said, there are other considerations that impact the number. We've mentioned in the past the fact that we want to stay ahead in terms of long lead items that we need to put in place. We want to put in place in order to be able to quickly react to market conditions. It does improve. And that's exactly what we did last fiscal year, and we were able to take advantage of those opportunities. So there is a portion of the $350 million that is dedicated to that. In general terms as well, another moving piece is that as we upgrade rigs, it will depend what the upgrade looks like, what it includes. As you know, many of our upgrades relate to adding a skidding package in addition to the 7,500 psi circulating system. That type of investment might be a $2 million to $3 million investment per rig. And in other cases, we may wish to upgrade of a standard FlexRig3 with a walking system and other capabilities. That investment would be higher, closer to $8 million.","In both cases, we've seen that we can get very attractive returns on those incremental investments, and so they're all favorable. At the end of the day, it will depend on the mix of how many we have. Just to give you a sense for last year, I believe we upgraded a total of 91 rigs. Only a few of those, maybe three, were walking rigs. All the rest were skidding systems. And so as you have seen, we spent approximately $400 million during fiscal 2017 in terms of CapEx. Your assumptions in general are fair, but just to warn you that there's many other moving pieces that impact the numbers.","Thomas Moll","Fair enough. My one follow-up would just be on the rigs that you do decide to upgrade this year, did I hear you correctly, it's right for us to think about some kind of customer commitment at the leading-edge?","John Lindsay","Tommy, that's our expectation. I think, again, we're trying to get our arms around the super-spec fleet. We kind of have an idea on what the supply side could possibly be. We're trying to determine what the demand side of the equation is. I think there are clear indicators that it's trending towards more complexity, longer laterals, more challenging, which pushes a standard reconfiguration. And so I think as a result of that and the customer needing more horsepower and more capability, therefore provides higher levels of performance. Well, then, I think in that case, we ought to have some sort of a commitment to make certain that we're getting reasonable rate of return and a payback on our investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.","Kurt Hallead","The one data point that called my attention again this quarter, as it did last quarter, was the commentary about the rigs that are currently under contract over the course of the next couple of fiscal years and the corresponding cash margins for those rigs that are under that term contract. And I just wanted to kind of assess, when you talk about the rigs that are on the contract for fiscal 2020, that they carry a $15,000-a-day cash margin. Were those contracts booked prior to 2014? Or since 2014?","John Lindsay","Prior to, Kurt. Those are old contracts. They're - I think there was a slight adjustment there. Sometimes, we need to make them. But yes, the 7 or 8 rigs that we already have contracted for 2020 at $15,400 expected margin, those are priced in a very attractive market conditions before the downturn.","Kurt Hallead","All right. Second question, follow-up for you was in the context of, you referenced that spot rates are in the high-teens. Super-spec rates are in the low to mid-20s. But I mean, John or Juan Pablo, the assets, effectively, the H&P operates right here. My guess is you're not really pricing in the high-teens. So I'm just trying to kind of calibrate that data point, right. Or probably more - your asset base is more gravitating to that low- to mid-20s kind of dynamic at this juncture.","John Lindsay","I think that is a fair assumption, Kurt. What we think the main takeaway from those two references, the high-teens going toward the low to mid-20s, is that we expect pricing to continue to go up, and especially average rig pricing. And so that's encouraging as we look not only at this second fiscal quarter, but hopefully, beyond through the rest of the fiscal year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.","Sean Meakim","So gentlemen, something - just to talk a little bit more about the CapEx budget, and I think the reasons to increase that are clear, but I was just curious why we remove the band. So is the visibility such that you're confident that number given customer budgets, cash flow they may have locked in as - through hedging is fairly tight here? Just trying to get a sense of the decision-making there and how much flex there is in that budget in both directions for fiscal '18.","John Lindsay","I like that, Sean. Flex in our budget. Flex in our FlexRig budget. That's nice. Can I use that going forward?","Sean Meakim","Sure. The pun was not intended, but happy for you to.","John Lindsay","Again, everyone is pleased. Everybody in the oil and gas business are pleased with improved commodity prices. And so I think there is an element of - with the outlook that we have. As Juan Pablo said, a lot of the CapEx is designed for outward months. We want to make certain we've got the appropriate supply chain in place. And so again, I think with what we're looking at right now, that would probably be the reason why we're closer to that $350 million, and we didn't give it a $300 million to $350 million range. So I think that's a reasonable assessment.","Juan Tardio","And then if I may add to that, John. I think if market conditions and opportunities coming our way allow it, there certainly is a possibility that the CapEx level or CapEx estimate would continue to go up. That is just our estimate in terms of what we believe is fair to assume at this point given what we see today.","Sean Meakim","Very helpful. Yes, I think that helps to frame it quite nicely. Just another topic I was hoping to touch on, you've made it pretty clear, certainly over time, that there's dilutive effects to M&A across rig fleets in the U.S., and no disagreements there. Just curious how you think about international. And clearly, longer cycle. It's an important part of your business, not the main driver. Is there appetite? I mean, could it make sense at some point to try to scale up that business if there are assets available or ways in which you could perhaps do a little more in the international side? Just curious how you think about that given there are some clear contrast versus the U.S. business.","John Lindsay","Sure. No, that makes sense. It's a good question. I - the international assets, rig assets, that are out there, that have been out there for quite some time, there's - I don't think anybody would be surprised which assets those are. And so I think, all of those have kind of had the tires kicked, so to speak. And they're just - when you look at the cost to acquire those assets and the level of the technology of those assets, we believe that this business is going to continue to be technology-driven going forward and acquiring older assets and older technology just doesn't really make a lot of sense. I think the analogy of kind of buying some assets and buying a beachhead, I think, you'd have to just pay for it too much for that. That's just - that's our perspective, but there may be others - other people that can make that strategy work.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.","Marc Bianchi","It looks like free cash flow after the dividend in this quarter was a negative about $100 million. Cash balance is now $380 million, yet you have CapEx going higher. You said you feel comfortable to continue paying a dividend. Should we interpret the increase in CapEx as confidence that cash generation should be improving kind of going forward from here?","Juan Tardio","Marc, this is Juan Pablo, by the way. I think your point is that when you look at cash from operating activities, the number may have been a little lower than what you may have expected. We do expect that number to continue to increase significantly. Part of what impacted the number related to some cash absorption in terms of working capital, obviously, as business improves, revenues increase. There's higher accounts receivable, et cetera that absorb working capital. Some movements in that regard and other considerations related to the quarter translated into a higher level of absorption of working capital than we or you may have expected. But going forward, I don't think that, that necessarily continues, at least to the extent that we saw during the first fiscal quarter. I would expect cash from operations levels to be significantly higher for the second fiscal quarter, given our guidance.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. Is it fair to think that cash after CapEx and after dividend can kind of get to some kind of a positive contribution at some over the next 2 or 3 quarters?","Juan Tardio","That all depends on our market conditions. Could it be the case? I think, yes. It's certainly possible. We wouldn't be surprised if that were to happen. But as you know, we don't provide guidance to give you a better sense of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.","Michael LaMotte","John, you've described MOTIVE and MagVAR as being a part of a family of solutions. I'm curious as to what your thoughts on how extensive that family could get with uncles, cousins, nephews, what it could look like in terms of sort of the range of solutions over time?","John Lindsay","Well, Michael, it's again another great, great question. If you think about the areas that we're focusing on, and we've spent a lot of time, I won't to go all the way through it, but just to mention that, over time, we've seen challenges with drilling efficiencies and reliability as a result of directional drillers. So that's one solution. The other is lateral for getting longer well complexity is greater, much higher opportunity for wellbore collision or as you're fracking these swells, making certain you have the right spacing. And that's where companies like MagVAR come into play.","And so again, I think as it relates to providing services and providing things that really help our customer be more efficient and effective, not just efficiency-related to the time drilling the well, but the overall production. So wellbore placement. So less tortuous wellbore long term creates a better-producing well as well as less cost associated with it to the life of the wells. So things like that. And so I sure wouldn't limit what we've done at this point. I think there's other opportunities. I'm not in a position, obviously, to talk about what those are today, but that's definitely in our sights as we see the market evolve and we see other ways to hopefully add value to customers.","Michael LaMotte","Okay. And somewhat related to that, I think it's interesting that the steps you've taken so far have been all software-related. Do you see a place or a need for any hardware component? Or are you happy to stick with software-based solutions?","John Lindsay","Well, hardware covers a broad spectrum. And so hardware as it relates to the rig, definitely, those are the things that we're going to continue to adopt and we'll continue to improve. Obviously, there's also additional software capabilities and other aspects of the business. I think what we've tried to be clear on is that what we aren't trying to do is to get into the downhole directional drilling space. And I think our desire is to help our customers and help our customers with the directional drilling space in the way that we've described with MOTIVE and MagVAR, but not to get into the downhole tool business and compete in that what you would consider a very highly competitive industry, if that helps.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Just want to cycle back and see if I could clarify some earlier comments in light of now achieving positive EBIT for the first time in seven quarters. Any fresh thoughts on capital allocation? I know you increased the CapEx somewhat. Obviously, we've talked about that quite a bit. But dividend, happy with where it's at? Any thoughts of returning cash to shareholders? I know we talked about M&A, but can you rank order some of the priorities?","Juan Tardio","Thanks, Timna. This is Juan Pablo. It's great to have a flexibility that we have, given our balance sheet and liquidity backlog, et cetera, to do all of the above, so to speak. We always have a preference in terms of investing in the business and certainly, making sure that before we do invest in the business, that we expect this opportunities to be attractive in terms of returns for our shareholders. And so when we see opportunities, we have plenty of flexibility to pursue those, and that's our first priority. Fortunately, we can also continue to return cash to shareholders. Our dividend level is at a level that we can sustain. Of course, we've increased that annual level for over 40 years. It's something that we think about carefully before making changes or defining levels, as we've said in the past. And if there are other opportunities, such as share repurchases, we will analyze of those as well. At this point, I think that it's fair to assume that the first two that I mentioned will probably continue to be our preferred vehicles.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Great. High-quality problem, of course. And then I just wanted to settle back, and maybe I'm too hung up on this, but in the prepared remarks, you made a comment that at the right price, you are prepared to add, I think it was 12 rigs per quarter, the reasonable pricing. Is that all baked into your assumption that pricing will be reasonable? Is that kind of a gradual price? What does reasonable pricing means to you, I guess, is the question?","John Lindsay","Yes. I guess what you're saying is we're not good now - one thing what we would say is we're not building these upgrades on spec. We're requiring, again, low-20 to mid-20 type of rate. We'd like to have a term contract to go along with that. So if we're receiving the kind of demand from customers like that, then we would continue to upgrade rigs. If you're not seeing that, if the customer - if the well economics don't support it for whatever reason or the outlook becomes negative, then we wouldn't continue to just build out super-spec rigs. We're going to have some limitor. So that's really what we're trying to accomplish. Lynn, I think, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Our last question will come from Ryan Pfingst with B.Riley FBR.","Ryan Pfingst","I'm in for Tom Curran this morning. If you could, what is MOTIVE's current active rig count right now and it's split between you guys and third-party rigs?","John Lindsay","I think they're in high-teens. And I want to say 1\/3 of the fleet are FlexRigs. Is that in line?","Juan Tardio","Yes.","John Lindsay","They're closing in on 20 jobs, so that's been good. They've made some nice progress. And like I said, 1\/3 of the fleet are FlexRigs.","Ryan Pfingst","Great. Do you have any targets set for that for growth in calendar 2018?","John Lindsay","Well, we always have some internal targets that we're trying to achieve, but nothing that we're in a position to announce. But we are very pleased with the progress that they're making, both on a technical basis as well as just customer adoption. All new technologies have a certain level of adoption time, and we're encouraged with the adoption process there we're seeing at this point in time.","Juan Tardio","Thank you, Ryan, and I believe John has some concluding remarks.","John Lindsay","Okay. So yes, I would just want to close out this morning just emphasizing how proud I am of our people. How they've embraced the challenges set before us these past three years has been a really challenging three years, as we all know, in this industry. There's a lot of evidence out there that the response that we've had in 2017 to the improving market conditions, which have been remarkable in terms of number of rigs activated. Our folks in the field have had an amazing response, those in terms of just putting rigs to work and providing very, very high levels of value to customers. Obviously, that flows through to shareholders, and just want to thank everybody for that. So we're looking forward to a really strong 2018. And thank you again for your time, and have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's program.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference will be recorded. And at this time, it is my pleasure to turn the program over to Mr. Juan Pablo Tardio. Please go ahead, sir.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone to Helmerich & Payne's Conference Call and Webcast Corresponding to the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2014. The speakers today will be John Lindsay, President and CEO; and me, Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO.","As usual and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter while achieving record revenues and record rig activity. Our continued success is a result of our people and new technology solutions that drive lower well costs for our customers. I would like to thank each of our employees for their contribution to the effort.","Our drilling and safety performance continue to lead the industry and provide growth opportunities for the company. Our U.S. land rig count today stands at 287 rigs, up over 40 rigs since our second quarter call this time last year. We are pleased to announce 9 additional new builds this morning, comprised of 6 FlexRig3s and 3 FlexRig5s. When combined with the 35 previously announced new builds, we now have a total of 44 new builds for the 2014 fiscal year, all with long-term contracts and attractive economic returns.","Of the 44 new builds announced, we have already delivered 25 with 13 FlexRigs that began work during the second fiscal quarter. We delivered 2 rigs per month for the first half of the fiscal year. And during April, we increased our construction cadence to 3 FlexRigs per month. Our plan is to continue that cadence at least through the remainder of the fiscal year. The market continues to be resilient, and we are encouraged by customer discussions for additional new builds. Our engineering, manufacturing and supply chain capabilities will allow us to respond quickly if future new build demand supports transitioning to a 4-rig per month cadence.","As we review the macro environment, oil and gas prices remain stronger than expected for 2014. This has resulted in allowing many of our customers to expand their drilling budgets. The U.S. land industry activity is up around 80 rigs in 2014 according to the Baker Hughes rig count and H&P has been able to grow along with the expansion and capture incremental market share gains. The increase in activity has primarily been associated with horizontal wells with longer laterals and pad drilling requirements that FlexRigs are designed to drill. As a result, we expect our activity and market share to continue to improve.","As evidenced by our new build contracts, our customers are seeking to both high-grade and expand their rig fleets as they transition into the development phase of the unconventional resource plays. This demand has improved the current day rate trends for our U.S. land segment on both spot market and term contract pricing. Juan Pablo will give more color on pricing in his comments. Overall, we are pleased with the improving trend.","An instrumental part of rig demand in the U.S. is the Permian Basin. With approximately 500 rigs working today, it is the most active and one of the most promising basins in the world, and it should be no surprise it is our fastest growing area. 3 years ago, our Permian operation had 25 active rigs, and we found ourselves out of office and yard space. In the past 12 months, we have added over 30 rigs and are now operating nearly 80 rigs. Fortunately, we had the foresight to buy additional land in Odessa in 2011. We built a large facility and moved in, in 2012. Our timing was good as many have been surprised by the faster-than-expected switch to horizontal drilling in the Permian and the demand for Tier 1 AC drive rigs.","The total horizontal rig count in the Permian today is approximately 300 rigs, which is a 200-rig increase from 2011. However, only 45% of the 300 rigs are AC drive rigs. As compared to the other large unconventional basins, like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, where approximately 65% of the horizontal wells are drilled utilizing AC drive rigs. Contrasting these 2 metrics would indicate a lot more growth potential for AC drive rigs in the Permian, and we believe FlexRigs will continue to gain market share over competitor rig offerings.","Even though the Permian has captured close to 50% of our new builds announced this fiscal year, we have also contracted new builds in the SCOOP, the Eagle Ford, Utica, Bakken, Haynesville, Woodbine and the Niobrara. We believe this demonstrates a continued high-grading of the existing rig fleet in basins that have had AC drive rigs working for multiple years.","In addition to our growth and market share gains in the U.S., we are also pleased with the recently announced contracts with YPF in the Vaca Muerta shale located in the Neuquen Province in Argentina. As a reminder, in March, we announced that YPF contracted 10 existing FlexRig3s that are being sourced and prepared for service from our U.S. land fleet. The rigs were contracted with 5-year term contracts, with the first rig scheduled to be delivered this summer. The last rig should deliver during the second fiscal quarter of 2015. It has been reported that Vaca Muerta is estimated to hold over 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent. And reportedly, it is the only unconventional resource outside of the U.S. which is actually producing oil, and many believe it has the greatest commercial potential of all unconventional shale plays outside of North America. We see this as a great opportunity to assist YPF and other operators in developing this unconventional shale play.","Our offshore fleet is now fully utilized, with the ninth rig receiving a commitment to work. The rig will be undergoing upgrades and is expected to commence operations early in fiscal 2015. Juan Pablo will share more offshore segment details in his remarks.","All 3 of our operating segments had encouraging prospects for improving activity and are setting up nicely for the remainder of the fiscal year.","On another note, I want to remind everyone of a point we have made on previous conference calls. Approximately 40% of all active rigs in the U.S. today are AC drive rigs. That is over 700 AC rigs out of approximately 1,750 currently active rigs. The remaining 60% of active rigs are comprised of legacy SCR and mechanical rigs, Tier 2 and Tier 3 rigs. The past 5 years have demonstrated a consistent trend whereby AC drive rigs have replaced legacy rigs. The AC rig market share has grown from 15% to over 40%, even with premium pricing levels as compared to the legacy equipment.","The industry has been forced into a restructuring of the fleet profile during this replacement cycle and are still having to manage aging SCR as well as mechanical rig fleets while drilling these complex horizontal wells we've been talking about. Fortunately for H&P, this hasn't been the case. Today, we are only working AC drive FlexRigs in U.S. land unconventional resource plays. We believe the fleet uniformity of the Flex 3, the Flex 4 and the Flex 5s are paying dividends with regards to maintenance costs, training effectiveness and providing a lean manufacturing environment. We will continue to strive for improved and more reliable levels of performance.","Let me conclude my remarks by noting H&P's long-term strategy for growing shareholder value. We will continue to drive innovation at the rig site and in the back office. We will invest in technology to drive safety improvements for our people and operational excellence for lowering our customers' drilling costs. And finally, we will continue to invest capital that results in attractive returns. Going forward, we believe H&P is the best-position land drilling contractor to capture this ongoing market share opportunity, both in the U.S. and international markets.","And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. The company reported $893 million in revenue during the second fiscal quarter 2014, along with $255 million in operating income and $175 million in net income. In trying to outline some of the key drivers that led to these results, I will first review each of our drilling segments and will then expand on other noteworthy considerations.","Our U.S. land segment led the way, delivering $245 million in segment operating income. The number of revenue days increased by about 3.6% from the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 270 active rigs during the second fiscal quarter. In average, approximately 155 of these rigs were active under term contracts, and approximately 115 rigs were active in the spot market.","Excluding the impact of having only 90 calendar days in the second fiscal quarter as compared to 92 in the prior quarter, the average number of active rigs increased by almost 6% as compared to an average of 255 active rigs during the prior quarter. Excluding early termination fees, the average rig revenue per day was practically flat at $28,037. And the average rig expense per day was up by approximately 1% to $13,080, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $14,957.","As of today, the 325 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include 287 contracted rigs, 33 idle rigs and 5 rigs currently held for the YPF Argentina project. Of the 33 idle rigs, only 1 was an AC drive FlexRig. The 287 contracted rigs are comprised of 286 AC drive FlexRigs and 1 3,000-horsepower SCR rig that was reactivated for ultradeep operations. Included in the 287 contracted rigs are 161 rigs under term contracts and 126 rigs in the spot market. Spot pricing has continued to slightly increase, and it is still about 5% lower as compared to pricing for rigs under term contracts, most of which were originally priced in even stronger markets during the last few years. As we transition into the third fiscal quarter, we expect revenue days to increase by about 7% quarter-to-quarter, along with relatively flat average rig revenue per day levels and relatively flat average rig expense per day levels.","Regarding our U.S. land term contract backlog, we already have term contract commitments for an average of 157 rigs for the remaining 2 quarters of fiscal 2014 and an average of 110 rigs for fiscal 2015. The average quarterly pricing level for these contracted rigs is expected to remain relatively flat during the corresponding 6 quarters. Should spot pricing continue to improve, we would not be surprised if our total average rig revenue per day begins to slightly increase a few quarters from now.","Let me now transition to our offshore segment, where segment operating income was approximately 5% stronger than in the prior quarter, and the average rig margin per day again exceeded our expectations at $27,665. Eight platform rigs remained active, and our ninth platform rig is now committed and expected to commence operations in fiscal 2015.","As we look at the third fiscal quarter, we expect flat utilization levels in our offshore segment and a decline in the average rig margin per day to approximately $25,000, primarily as a result of a pricing adjustment on 1 of the 8 active rigs. The pricing adjustment will take place during the third fiscal quarter and after the rig finalizes the first phase of an ongoing project that required a significant upfront investment. This pricing adjustment is also expected to unfavorably affect our fourth fiscal quarter average rig margin per day by another few thousand dollars as compared to the third fiscal quarter.","Additionally, we have continued to experience a strong contribution to our offshore segment operating income from management contracts on customer-owned platform rigs. The contribution during the second fiscal quarter was slightly under $5 million, and it is expected to decline to approximately $4 million during the third fiscal quarter and then increase to approximately $5 million during the fourth fiscal quarter. The quarterly contribution for management contracts may increase to $6 million or $7 million during fiscal 2015.","I will now transition to the international land segment, where segment operating income declined by approximately $1.6 million as we experienced a lower level of activity during the second fiscal quarter as compared to the first fiscal quarter. Revenue days decreased by about 6% for an average of 22.6 active rigs. A rig in Tunisia and a rig in Colombia became idle during the second fiscal quarter. Nevertheless, the average rig margin per day increased by $576 to $10,919 during that same period.","As of today, our international land segment has 22 active rigs, 13 of which are AC drive FlexRigs. Eight of the active rigs are in Argentina, 4 in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador, 3 in Bahrain and 2 in the UAE. A total of 7 rigs are currently idle in the segment, 3 of which are in Colombia, 2 in Tunisia, 1 in Argentina and 1 in Ecuador. In addition, one new rig is in transit to its first location in Colombia and one rig is in the process of moving from the U.S. to Mozambique.","For the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land revenue days to be relatively flat as compared to the second fiscal quarter, and corresponding average rig margin per day is expected to be down by approximately 5% as compared to the prior quarter. Looking further ahead, the new 3,000-horsepower AC drive rig that is in transit to its first location in Colombia is expected to begin operations early in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, we expect 2 of the 10 rigs deploying to Argentina from the U.S. and the rig in transit to Mozambique to also commence operations before the end of the fiscal year.","I will now transition from segment-related information to other important topics, including our revised capital expenditures estimate and our expected income tax rate for the rest of the fiscal year. Given today's announcement of an additional 9 new build commitments, other previously announced contracts and ongoing conversations with customers that may lead to additional FlexRig commitments, the company's new fiscal 2014 capital expenditures estimate increased from $950 million to $1.1 billion. This will provide significant flexibility in terms of our ability to deliver additional new builds during the first fiscal quarter of 2015.","Approximately 60% of the revised CapEx estimate corresponds to our new build program, approximately 25% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to other projects. The actual spending level may vary, depending primarily on the timing of procurement related to our ongoing new build efforts and actual maintenance capital requirements during the year. We still expect to be able to fully fund our fiscal 2014 CapEx program as well as other scheduled commitments from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities during the fiscal year.","Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations during the second fiscal quarter was reported at approximately 36.6%. This higher-than-expected effective tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to updated tax estimates for the year that no longer allow us to realign or take advantage of previously estimated excess foreign tax credits during fiscal 2014. We expect the effective income tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2014 to be between 34% and 35%, and the effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2014 to be approximately 35%.","As it relates to our investment portfolio, the company sold 250,000 shares of its Schlumberger holdings for a total proceeds of over $23 million that favorably impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.12 in the quarter. Our remaining investment portfolio recently had a pretax market value of approximately $260 million and an after-tax value of approximately $160 million.","Regarding other previously provided fiscal 2014 estimates, we still expect our annual depreciation expense to total approximately $500 million and general and administrative expenses to total approximately $130 million. Interest expense net of capitalized interest is expected to be in the range of $4 million to $6 million during fiscal 2014.","That concludes our prepared comments. And Mike [ph], we will now open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Robin Shoemaker with Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Juan Pablo, can you just explain again what led to the decline in average rig margin sequentially? And were you saying that you expect the average rig margin per day in the U.S. to be relatively constant for a few quarters going forward?","Juan Pablo Tardio","I think your question regarding the margin relates to our transition from the first fiscal quarter to the second fiscal quarter going slightly down. And we had previously guided our average rig revenue per day to be flat to slightly down, and we did expect our average rig expense per day to be at $13,000 or probably higher as we spoke about it during the last conference call. So we weren't surprised to see that slight drop in average rig margin. As we go into the next several quarters -- so let me just suggest the June quarter -- as you know, we guided toward a relatively flat revenue per day numbers and relatively flat expense per day numbers which would yield approximately relatively flat margin per day results. So that's in general our expectation for June. As we see how the combination of our terms -- excuse me, of our rigs that are under term contracts and our rigs that are in the spot market and how that pricing works out in terms of total weighted average as rigs roll off of term contracts and as new builds are deployed, et cetera, there's a lot of moving variables there. So I just wanted to give you a sense in terms of what would happen if we continue to see the level of spot pricing go slightly up quarter-over-quarter at -- in that type of setting. And what we would expect and would not be surprised by is again, if we continue to see this slight trend of increasing pricing, is that the average rig revenue per day may slightly go up during the next -- I should rephrase that -- in a few -- during a few quarters from now -- or in a few quarters from now. So not in the June quarter, but perhaps in the September quarter, maybe in the December quarter, depending again on many moving variables. We hope that rig expense levels per day continue to be relatively flat. The assumption there would be, of course, if average rig revenue increases and average rig expense continues to be more or less flat, then yes, we would expect to have some increase in the average rig margins for the segment.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the 44 new builds that are under long-term contracts, is there any upward movement in the long-term contract rate in, let's say, in the -- ones you've sign recently of the 44 versus 6 months ago or 8 months ago? Is that term contract rate moving at all as the spot rate is?","John W. Lindsay","Robin, this is John. Yes, the pricing is improving. The contracts that we've entered into recently have higher rates than what we had 6 months ago or so.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then if I may on the same topic on the new builds, is there with a -- any increase in new build cost either because of equipment costs or because you're going from 2 per month to 3 per month so maybe that would maybe slightly lower the cost, I'm not sure? But is there any upward trend at all in the costs of building a Flex 3 or a Flex 5 compared to last year?","John W. Lindsay","Right. Well, if you're comparing on an apples-to-apples basis, the costs are relatively flat. We really don't see a -- what I'm thinking -- what I'm speaking to, Robin, is a standard Flex 3, say, without a skid system or without an additional higher pressure capability. It's going to be a similar type investment to what we've had over time. But we are -- again, FlexRig5s are a higher investment than a Flex 3 -- a standard Flex 3, so that investment is higher. As we have customers desire longer -- going from 100-foot skid system to a 200-foot skid system, adding 7,500 psi pumping systems -- all of those things drive the investment up. At the same time, we're getting a corresponding rate increase that's going to, again, keep our rates of return at the levels that you've been used to seeing as.","Operator","And we'll go next to Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","John, should we -- are we at the point in the cycle where we should expect to see your FlexRigs that are -- some of your FlexRigs that are currently working in the spot market start to get termed out? And if so, what's the nature of those conversations in terms of the tender of the term? Is it starting to push out further 1-year, 1-year plus? Just curious as to your thoughts on that.","John W. Lindsay","Well, we're -- I guess we're slightly over 50% of the working fleet that's on term. I think probably a year ago, we were closer to 2\/3 of our fleet that was term. So I wouldn't be surprised to see that -- from our perspective, I do think we'd be interested. We're not going to be interested in the 6 months. It's going to need to be, if I would think, longer than a year, a year to 2 years or I think other than that, we'd probably just assume -- just remain in the spot market. But I think it's reasonable to expect for us to maintain that 50% to 60% range of term contract to spot market. Does that answer your question, Byron?","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","It does. And it seems like your -- the strategy is to grow your U.S. rig count via new build FlexRigs. And so how do you think about the long-term strategy for the SCR rigs in your feet? Are those going to be opportunistic on the international side as opportunities arise? Just how are you thinking about those rigs?","John W. Lindsay","Well, you noted that we do have -- we did put an SCR rig back to work. It's a 3,000 horsepower. We have 8 of those I believe in the U.S. today. Actually, I guess we have 7. 7 SCR 3,000-horsepower in the U.S. That's an ultradeep well that it's going to work on. I think there's the potential to have more of that type of work in the future. As far as the rest of the fleet, from our perspective, there's not customer demand for 1,200-, 1,500-horsepower SCR-type rigs. Obviously, our competitors are utilizing those rigs and growing their fleet in that capacity. From our perspective, again, at least from our customers, we don't see a demand from them or a desire for them to pick at one of our Flex 1s or Flex 2s, or one of our older SCR type of rigs. If you think about it from our perspective, too, is the SCR fleet -- our fleet is so small on a relative basis, percentage basis, compared to the rest of our operating fleet. When you hear us talk about the uniformity, the advantages of having a uniform fleet, the consistency that we're able to provide from a training, from supply chain, from a performance perspective, it really is the best [indiscernible] for us to think about putting those rigs back to work right now. I do think there are -- again, there's competitors out there that are putting SCR rigs back to work. There could be a situation where those SCR rigs could be sold to another contractor or be sold to international markets as a possibility. But at least from our perspective, we see far too many advantages to leveraging the uniformity of our fleet. We do see a lot of advantages there.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And last question for me. I think I heard -- of the 9 new build FlexRig contracts that you announced today, I think I heard 6 Flex 3s and 3 Flex 5s. Just curious as to the basin distribution of those and whether they'll -- all or most of them have skidding systems.","John W. Lindsay","The distribution, 4 of the 9 are going to the Permian, 2 to the Eagle Ford, 2 to the Utica and 1 to the Haynesville. It's about a 50-50 mix on skid systems. If you were to look -- at it's interesting. If you look at the 44 that we've announced this fiscal year, if you're looking at about 60 -- or about 2\/3 of those rigs have skid systems. But if you were to differentiate between the Permian and then all the other basins that I talked about that were working, the Permian has an average of about 40 -- about 40% of those rigs have skid systems, whereas those other basins are closer to 85%. And so I think what it is, it's an indicator of those other basins that are further along the path of development, the development phase of drilling and going more into pad drilling. And I think clearly, there are -- some of our customers in the Permian that are at that phase, but there's still a lot of customers out there that are still probably holding acreage and exploring to a certain extent. The great news, Byron, is all of those Flex 3s that don't have skid systems and we continue to build additional skid systems for Flex 3s in the fleet in addition to our new build, those rigs are all capable of having the skid package added at a later date, and that's been I think very successful for us and for our customers.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And so I just want to come back in and get a look at the U.S. land drilling dynamic, the fact that you have 95% plus utilization on AC class rigs. And yes, you have some other legacy rigs that may be adding to the marketplace but clearly, not satisfying demand completely. Your outlook on a relatively flat pricing and margin is kind of a head scratcher, I guess, given the tightness in the market. I know you gave some explanation a little bit earlier, but I don't know if something's not adding up. I'm just hoping that you might be able to try to add again, at least, for my benefit. Add a little color to why kind of just a flattish outlook when the market is just so tight. And you do have 115 rigs available to the spot market, so it's not like you're 80% contracted and you can't benefit from the spot market pricing. So what -- can you help me connect the dots here?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, Kurt. This is John. I want to say a few things, and I was going to have Juan Pablo give a little more granularity. It's a great question, and we understand because it is a strong market. We are doing our best to get our spot market pricing back to the levels that it was in 2012 prior to the slowdown that we all saw. I think we're still approximately 5% or so away from that. It's interesting, Kurt, when you look at our average spot market day rates and our average term contract day rates today compared to other all-time highs, they're pretty much spot on. I mean -- so we are -- we do have some very -- what we will consider a very attractive pricing. We're continuing to price that up. But part of the challenge is -- and that's what Juan Pablo can give a little more color on -- is just when you consider all of the different variables associated with the different rig sizes and types and areas and rigs rolling off with term contract that drives that. So Juan Pablo, you might share or give a little bit more color on that.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Sure. Kurt, I think the easiest way to understand it is to consider that the rigs in general that are in the spot market, as we mentioned earlier, were set in terms of pricing and stronger markets in general. And so what is happening is that as those rigs roll off of their term contract, their pricing is coming down to approximately where the spot pricing is today. And that dynamic provides a downward pull to the average, which is offset by what you mentioned. We're seeing an increasing trend in terms of pricing in the spot market, which offsets that downward pull that I just mentioned in terms of the term contracts.","Operator","And we will go next to Tom Curran with FBR Capital Markets.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","John, since you opened the door, I'll step through it. What do you think your SCR rigs on average could command in the secondary market right now? And have you entertained any interest from potential buyers?","John W. Lindsay","Well, we haven't sold -- obviously, we haven't sold the Flex 1 or Flex 2. We have sold some SCR rigs in the past 2 years or so that were -- horsepower ranges from 1,000 up to probably 1,500 and varying condition, and the range was probably a $3 million to $5 million, $3 million to $6 million range. It's really hard for us to say again. Without us being out there marketing those rigs, it's hard to say that. I mean, we're going to continue to evaluate our options on what we might possibly do. Again, what -- the point I made earlier, the great position that we're in as our idle SCR fleet is a very, very small percentage of our overall available fleet. We don't have any mechanical rigs. And so we're not having to be out there fighting to try to gain market share by investing additional dollars in those older rigs and trying to make them competitive. So -- and I mean, it's a great question. I don't have an answer for you right now. Again, I just -- I threw it out there as a possibility. I mean, we have been successful in selling some SCR rigs over the last couple of years. But if we could be successful going forward on these others, it's hard to say at this stage.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Then shifting gears to the new build program. With the resurgence in incremental Tier 1 new build award flow we've seen since the start of the second half of 2013, you guys have reclaimed the lead in terms of your win rate of the awards that have been made to the big 4 land drillers. Why wouldn't you now go ahead and step up your speculative construction and take your cadence today to 4 rigs per month and start adding those speculative new builds to the queue?","John W. Lindsay","Tom, I mean, again, that's a great question on your part. I think from our perspective, we lack the model that we've used over the years. We've been successful with it. One of the key advantages, of course, we have is our ability to scale our cadence up and then pull it back if need be. Obviously, for the first time that I can recall, last summer, when we didn't have new build pricing that would support new build contracts, we continued to build rigs at 2 a month, for our own account, for our spare capacity. And fortunately, the market responded and we were able to take advantage of that. But from just purely building on spec, I mean, we don't view it as that. Again, if you look at our fleet profile, we've got to have those spare capacity, that spare kit. If the demand gets to the level it needs to, we're going to be able to respond quickly. We've been able to do that in the past. You've seen us before go from 2 to 3 to 4 in a relatively short period of time. We could do the same thing here. So I think we're going to let the demand drive that. I don't think, Tom, that we're really giving up any material number of rigs by doing what -- versus -- doing what we're doing versus what you're suggesting, which is go ahead and kick it into 4 a month right now. I don't think we're really giving it anything.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So no concerns about you seeing potential renewed erosion of pull position here by holding off on that?","John W. Lindsay","Tom, I don't. Because, really, if you look at -- we've been estimating that for 2014, 80 to 100 new AC rigs would be built. Interestingly enough, we though last year, there would be 80. I think it ended up being less than 70. It turned out to be around 65. Well, we're thinking that now, it's probably 90 to 100 for 2014. I don't know what that spells for 2015 yet. But the other providers of AC rigs, I don't see a huge appetite on their part to really ramp up their production cadence, and so I don't know whether they have the capability or not. But I sure don't get the feeling that we're going to lose market share or our lead position by holding off at this stage of the game. Again, there may be some information out there that I'm not aware of, but I sure feel like that. We're in the lead, and we're well positioned and feel like we're going to be able to continue to maintain that.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Last one for me. Moving south to Vaca Muerta, what's the earliest, timing-wise, we might see a renewed -- a follow-on tranche of awards, and what would be the potential size range for that next tranche?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think it would be very difficult to respond prior to 2015, and so I think that's what probably makes the most sense. I mean, as you heard earlier, we're essentially at 100% utilization of our AC fleet here. We've got 5 rigs in the U.S. that are idle now that are going in, and so that means there's additional 5 that are working that will go. And then we'll -- so -- and even from a new build perspective, that would be -- probably be hard to get that down. So it's going to be 2015. I think a 5 or 10 -- if we could add another 5 or 10 in 2015, I would -- I'd be really pleased with that. But again, you've heard me say before that my predictions on international growth had been off before, so it's just really not clear for us at this stage on what the size and the scope for 2015. We do know that it would be difficult to respond prior to 2015.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Then we'll go next to John Daniel with Simmons & Company.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","When you guys have mentioned that your contract coverage is 110 rigs for fiscal '15, that's including all of the contracted rigs that haven't been delivered yet, correct?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, John.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. The average 157 contracted rigs for the next 2 quarters then dropped to an average of 110 for next fiscal year, so the drop-off in contracted rig is more rapid than the new builds that are being delivered? And you've got a 5% delta between contracted and spot revenue per day. So basically, until we see an -- call it a 5% improvement in the spot market, it's tough to see rev growth per day increasing if I kind of summarize that?","John W. Lindsay","That's fair.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Is that -- okay. And so if that's fair, then do you see that type of pricing leverage unfolding in the next 3 to 6 months in the spot market?","John W. Lindsay","Well, John, it's hard to say. Again, I mentioned earlier we're trying to get our 5% or so back that we gave up. We've gotten some of that back. We'd like to get the rest of it back. And again, let's face it. It's a function of our customers, and it's a function of our performance. As much as we'd like to say it, I mean, really the customers are the ones that are driving this, both from a demand perspective and what they're willing to pay for a contractor's given performance. And so I think that's really what it's a function of, and I like our chances. I think we're in a great position to continue to capture some of that pricing back and hopefully, we'll be able to deliver that over the next couple of quarters.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. I won't beat the dead horse. When you guys report average revenue per day of $28,000, how much of that revenue per day is not through day rate? Ballpark? $1,000, $500, $300?","John W. Lindsay","Probably, it's a mixed bag in terms of each of the contracts that are out there. In average, it's probably around 5% to 10%, but that's just a rough estimate.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. And then what type of rig is going to Mozambique?","John W. Lindsay","That's a FlexRig3.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then last one for me. Don't take this the wrong way, but do you have any payment protection built into the YPF contract, and are you going to be able to get cash out of the country?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think we've done a very good job in -- we obviously understand the risks, but I think we have as good a contract as we could expect to get. I'm pleased with that. And it's not risk-free. But again, we've worked in Argentina and other countries internationally for a long time, and so I think we've done a good job protecting ourselves. And I feel good about that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Brad Handler with Jefferies.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Please forgive me if I'm retreading an old ground. I don't think I am, but it has been a -- there has been a lot of calls this morning. Question on operating costs. You guys have held -- it sounds like you've -- it seems like you've held your ground at the $13,000 a day range despite having a lot of rig moves. And I guess I'm curious if there's an opportunity or how you might describe the conditions if the rig moves slow, and do you think rig moves might slow that, that might allow for some operating cost opportunity?","John W. Lindsay","Brad, this is John. I mean, it's a great question. I think your sense is right. There's a possibility of -- of course, there's always the other side, which is well -- what are other variables that have changed that we may not have great insight into at this stage of the quarter. I mean, obviously, if you look at previous quarters, there have been times that we've reported expenses at $12,000 or $12,700, $12,800, so that's possible. But we're continuing to deliver a lot of rigs, both new builds as well as moving rigs from basin to basin. Anytime that's happening, I'm always a little bit concerned about that. But overall, again, I'm very pleased with our people's work on getting the costs more consistent. They've worked very, very hard on it. They've worked on a lot of systems-type things that have been of help. So if we had our vote, we'd vote for yes. We'd vote for $12,700 or $12,800. But at this stage, I think $13,000 -- the range that we've guided to makes the most sense [indiscernible]","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","To give you some room, it sounds like, for other variables as you say.","John W. Lindsay","I think that's -- again, I think it's fair. If you look at our expense per day trends over time, I mean, we've seen $1,000, $1,500 a day fluctuation. But if you -- again, if you look at our last 6 quarter average, it's right at $13,000 a day. And again, we had some that are higher, some that are lower. So it's a possibility that it could come in lower, but we're sure not expecting it.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. Maybe a separate question, and I have a feeling I'm starting to tread on ground that's been well trod on this call so, again, forgive me. But have you shared the spread between current term rates and spot rates?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, Brad. This is Juan Pablo. We mentioned that the pricing difference is still at around 5%. And that's -- that is an apples-to-apples comparison just to make sure that everybody's clear in terms of where we are in the market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","John W. Lindsay","All right. Well, if there are no other questions, Mike, thank you, everybody, for joining -- yes?","Operator","Pardon the interruption, gentlemen. We do just have one more. It is Mike Breard with Hodges Capital.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","I'm just wondering, you're holding flat rigs in the U.S. for a shipment in Argentina. Are you getting sort of a standby rate on that or quarterly mobilization moves?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Mike, it's a little bit of a mixed bag because those rigs haven't all been sitting there idle. And there's this churn. You heard us talk about this in the past where we have a churn. Even though quarter-to-quarter, we may have had 12 or 15 or 18 AC rigs idle, it wasn't the same 12 or 15 or 18. There was a churn. And so what we've tried to do as best as we can is when rigs grow off of some contracts or off of the contract, those are the rigs that were pulling and going. Any standby time or anything like that is going to be built into the mobilization as far as in our bid. And you're just not talking about any material type of effect at all. But it's a great question. And we've done the best we can. I think our people have worked with our existing customers and figured out ways to make this happen.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","All right. And if you put more rigs in Argentina in 2015, I guess, theoretically, it could be a mixture of new rigs and existing rigs.","John W. Lindsay","I think it will be -- would potentially be difficult to make new build economics. We're -- in Argentina, I think it would be more likely that we will continue to send existing FlexRig3s and FlexRig4s. There are some additional demand for some of the smaller rigs as well. So that would be our expectations just from a new build economics perspective.","Michael Breard - Hodges Capital Management Inc.","Okay. So they don't need quite as advanced a rig? I mean, they're not drilling the longer laterals and all the kind of stuff that we're drilling here in the U.S.?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Mike, I wouldn't agree with that. What I would say is they're on the front end of developing that shale. And in fact, some of the wells that are being drilled, some are horizontal and some aren't. They're trending more towards horizontal. All of these rigs will have our skid system. So I think they'll likely have in the U.S., I think they'll start with -- I'm just going to throw a number out -- 4,000-foot laterals. And over time, they'll trend like we have trended here in the U.S. They'll get to 6,000, 8,000, 10,000-foot laterals. But obviously, there's a learning curve and it takes time to figure out on the frac side how to do things in the most efficient way. But these rigs that we're sending are advanced-technology Flex 3s. I mean, these rigs are going to drill wells down there as if we were sending a new build Flex 3. So we're sure not sending a compromised product at all. We're just sending an existing rig. Otherwise -- again, we couldn't do it with new builds and we couldn't do it because of the new build economics. But I think it's an attractive situation for us and for YPF.","All right.

H&P is responding with upgrades to our existing AC fleet, as we are perhaps the only contractor with the right AC rig fleet capacity to grow substantially without requiring a large investment in new rigs.","Despite choppiness in the market created by oil prices, H&P is successfully growing market share and continuing to build its brand. Our people remain the driving force of our success and the company continues to place extensive focus on organizational effectiveness and equipping all of our employees to deliver excellence for the customer.","Technology will continue to play a pivotal role in the company's future success with analytics, big data and machine learning being significant areas of opportunity for the industry. On June 2, 2017, the company closed on the acquisition of MOTIVE Drilling Technologies. MOTIVE has developed a Bit Guidance System that utilizes cognitive computing to improve directional drilling, decision automation and optimization.","MOTIVE is a technology company with 14 U.S. patents issued, and has been leveraging and refining these technologies commercially on the rig floor for several years using lessons learned from other industrial and military applications.","MOTIVE is a leader in this space and to-date their system has been used to drill over 3 million feet of horizontal hole across all of the major U.S. shale plays and in Canada.","MOTIVE technology is important, because there's a wide variance in directional drilling performance. Directional drillers are struggling to keep pace with increased drilling speeds, while delivering the accuracy required to place a wellbore in the desired sweet spot to maximize production.","Training and the standardization of directional drilling approaches to complex problems is required to meet this challenge, particularly as horizontal wells grow in lateral length and complexity. Technology, like the MOTIVE team has developed, is making predictable and repeatable well manufacturing a reality for complex, unconventional horizontal well programs. The Bit Guidance System isn't a downhole tool. It's a software solutions and, therefore, H&P isn't competing in the directional drilling business.","Another advantage that we believe exists for MOTIVE's Bit Guidance System is that it was initially incubated within an oil and gas operator, aimed at solving problems from an E&P company perspective, rather than that of the service provider. We found this to be precisely aligned with the core purpose of our company.","What's more? They have built a significant amount of flexibility into their approach to allow their Bit Guidance System to adjust to priorities that can be customized across customers and regions. MOTIVE technology has been shown to produce higher quality wellbores and, more accurately, placement of the bits and the target reservoirs; and as a result, enables more production for our customers.","Aligned with H&P's lower total well cost value proposition, MOTIVE technology drives decisions according to total well economics. This is unique and ultimately what matters to the customer. MOTIVE will continue to be deployed on FlexRigs and non-H&P rigs with a variety of directional drillers and tool providers.","H&P strives to be a leader in new technology, and we believe the future digital oil field will be fueled by technologies like MOTIVE. Strategic technology acquisitions like this add to our advanced rig fleet and sizable operating capacity, sharpen our service offering and enable the company to maintain its leadership position in the market. Our intention is to build on these and other strengths to successfully grow in the U.S. land market.","We've maintained an industry-leading cadence for upgrades, which has allowed us to increase our active fleet by 98 rigs during the fiscal year, 86 of which were super-spec upgrades. During the fiscal year, our upgrade cadence for super-spec rigs averaged approximately 8 rigs per month and today we have a total of 140 super-spec rigs in the U.S. land fleet.","With customer-sponsored contracts, we are continuing to upgrade standard Flex3s with skid systems, including the 7,500 psi mud systems, third mud pump, fourth engine and setback increase where needed. Recall that we also built a prototype Flex3 with walking capability earlier this year. That rig has been active since May and has performed like we would expect our best-in-class Flex3s to perform.","We are planning to equip at least four additional Flex3 rigs with walking systems and three are already committed to customers. The investment to add the walking system, including the new substructure design and other features, is approximately $5 million with a total upgrade investment between $7 million to $8 million. These upgrade investments include 7,500 psi mud system, a third mud pump, fourth engine and a higher horsepower top drive.","Let me add some additional clarity here. All of the Flex3s we used for walking rigs were existing base design Flex3s, which did not have any skid system or other upgrades included. Our Flex3s with skid systems remain in very high demand, with approximately 100 contracted today, and those units are essentially at full utilization, and we continue to have demand for those systems.","Having a uniform fleet of FlexRig3s, FlexRig4s and Flex5s enables us to provide a family of solutions for our customer, a fleet design to adapt to the future technology needs in the market and the capacity to deliver the right rig for their project.","Before I hand the call over to Juan Pablo it's worthy of mentioning again that the efforts undertaken over the past couple of years to enhance organizational effectiveness are paying significant dividends. We've demonstrated the ability to achieve operational scalability, maintain a strong balance sheet and enhance a healthy environment throughout the organization. This is particularly apparent in our ability to respond to demand and add value to the customer.","We had an opportunity to witness the value proposition firsthand last week when the leadership team and I made one of our quarterly rig visits. We visited several FlexRig3s, FlexRig4s, and FlexRig5s. All were working in the Colorado operation and they were all in world-class condition.","Our customers were not only pleased with the rigs, but also with the morale, the service attitude and the performance of our people. This was another reminder, an example, that without the effort of our people, the great field results we have achieved during this fiscal year wouldn't have been possible.","And I'll now turn the call over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I will expand on some of the announced information on each of our three drilling segments, followed by some comments on corporate-level details.","On our U.S. Land Drilling segment, first let me highlight some of the details related to our growth in activity during the last three months. Since the last earnings call on April 27, 2017, we have put 17 FlexRigs back to work. The Permian led the way with 10 rigs, followed by two each in the Niobrara and SCOOP and STACK plays, and one each in the Eagle Ford, Piceance and Utica.","From a FlexRig model perspective, 16 of the 17 were FlexRig3s and one was a FlexRig4. Of these 17 rigs, 9 had super-spec-level upgrades. We have also added seven new customers since the last call as a result of the performance our folks are delivering.","Our three most active basins today are the Permian, the SCOOP and STACK play, and the Eagle Ford. The Permian remains our most active operation with 91 rigs contracted, compared to 85 rigs during the 2014 peak. We have 45 idle FlexRigs in the area, 26 of which have 1,500-horsepower drawworks rating. We're very pleased with our leading position in the Permian and expect to have additional opportunities to grow our active fleet in this area.","In the SCOOP and STACK and Eagle Ford today, we have 31 and 26 rigs contracted, coming off a low of 15 and 16 contracted rigs, respectively.","As for the overall U.S. Land segment results corresponding to the third fiscal quarter, we exited the period with 190 contracted rigs and had an increase of approximately 26% in total quarterly revenue days. The increasing proportion of rigs priced on the recent market conditions drove a 2% decline in adjusted average rig revenue per day to $21,676 in the quarter. As expected, the average rig expense per day decreased by about 9% to $14,256, mostly driven by a lower number of activated rigs generating upfront expenses as compared to the prior quarter.","Looking ahead at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect a sequential increase of 3% to 5% in quarterly revenue days. Given the slowdown in activity driven by lower commodity prices, however, it would not be surprising to see our quarter exit activity level be flat to down, as compared to our activity level of 190 rigs at the beginning of the quarter. Keep in mind that even in a flat rig count environment, it is normal to have some rigs released while others go back to work, depending on several factors, including the type of rig required and the rig site location.","Given the increasing proportion of active rigs priced under recent market conditions, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to decline to roughly $21,000 and perhaps slightly over that level. We do expect the average spot pricing level for FlexRigs to continue to increase during the quarter.","We continue to deliver great value to our customers with our differentiated offering. Helping the customer to lower their total well cost is at the heart of H&P's value proposition, where savings can readily be achieved through drilling productivity gains and performance and reliability, as well as through a higher quality wellbore.","The average rig expense per day level is expected to significantly decrease to roughly $13,700, as rig startup expenses sequentially have a much lower level of impact on the total average during the fourth fiscal quarter. Expenses corresponding to our remaining stacked AC drive FlexRigs represent approximately 3% to 4% of the mentioned average rig expense estimate of $13,700 per day.","Another important consideration is that about half of our 189 contracted rigs today are under term contracts. And roughly half of those rigs under term contracts were priced during strong markets before the 2014 downturn.","The remaining rigs under term contract, approximately 50, were priced during the downturn and have a remaining average duration of less than one year. As a result, the expected average rig margin per day for all of our rigs already under term contracts in this segment during the fourth quarter is roughly $11,500.","Given the changing mix of term contracts that are currently in the backlog, the expected annual rig margin per day averages for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 corresponding to these term contracts are roughly $13,000, $14,500 and $15,500 respectively.","No early termination notices for rigs in this segment have been received since last summer. But given prior notifications, we expect to generate approximately $5 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and approximately $15 million during several quarters thereafter in early termination revenues.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. The number of quarterly revenue days decreased by approximately 8% and we exited the third fiscal quarter with six contracted rigs. We expected one of the six rigs to stack during the third quarter, but the rig is now scheduled to demobilize during the fourth fiscal quarter.","The average rig margin per day increased sequentially by about 6% to $11,503. Management contracts contributed approximately $4 million to operating income.","As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, quarterly revenue days are expected to decrease by approximately 10%, exiting the quarter with five contracted rigs, one of which is expected to remain under standby-type day rate. Average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $12,500.","Moving on to our international land operations. Excluding retroactive adjustments related to the impact of the previously announced withdrawal by a customer of an early termination notice for five rigs under long-term contracts in Argentina, the average rig margin per day in the segment was $8,978 and the number of quarterly revenue days was 1,183 or an average of 13 contracted rigs, including the 10 rigs under term contracts in Argentina, 2 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain.","As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, adjusted quarterly revenue days are expected to be essentially flat, with 13 contracted rigs during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to be approximately $7,500. The sequential decline is primarily driven by the expiration of a long-term contract in Colombia, which is expected to continue to work at a lower day rate that reflects current market conditions.","Let me now comment on corporate-level details. First, we were very pleased to be in position to pursue the acquisition of MOTIVE Drilling Technologies. As John mentioned, we believe that this small acquisition will allow us to create additional value for the customer, while at the same time take advantage of the scale of our FlexRig platform, which is the most capable and standardized fleet in the business. Given that MOTIVE's near-term impact to H&P's revenue and expenses is expected to be immaterial, MOTIVE's results will at this time not be reported as a separate segment.","Second, given the strength of our balance sheet and backlog, and the company's flexibility to adjust capital expenditures as a function of market conditions, we remain well-positioned to sustain regular dividend levels during the foreseeable future. Although it may be choppy, we do expect a continued recovery in the business during the next few years. Nevertheless, if market conditions were to deteriorate toward an expectation of a prolonged down-cycle, we will do our best to describe potential changes to our approach to the dividend before implementing such changes.","As mentioned in the past, it is unlikely that the company would issue additional debt with the sole purpose of sustaining or increasing current dividend levels. To be clear, that is not to say that the company would not take advantage of its balance sheet strength in the future, as it has in the past, to potentially issue additional debt for the purpose of pursuing attractive business opportunities.","Lastly, the effective income tax rate on the estimated loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 is expected to be around 32%. As mentioned in the past, this expected rate is lower than the statutory rate, primarily due to foreign jurisdictions where tax benefits associated with operating losses remain uncertain.","Let me now turn the call back to John.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Pablo. Juan Pablo gave you a preview of our expectations for the fourth quarter. With the uncertainty in the supply-demand outlook, we are anticipating that oil prices will remain range-bound in the mid-to-high 40s through calendar 2017.","We believe in that oil price environment we still have the potential to improve day rates and capture market shares, even with a flat rig count scenario, because of our efficiencies, our high-grade opportunities and significant value to customers.","We have grown market share from 15% at the peak in 2014 to approximately 20% market share today. We remain confident about the future for H&P, as our competitive advantages remain in our people, performance, technology, reliability and uniform FlexRig fleet.","And now, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Colin Davies of Bernstein. Your line is open.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Colin?","Operator","Mr. Davies, your line is open . We'll move next to Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is open.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Kurt.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Yeah. Very interesting times and indeed that's for sure. So, John, wanted to maybe come back around to some of the commentaries that you've already made regarding the ability to increase your market share to potentially increase rate. And if you can, maybe expand upon the types of value propositions that you're able to deliver in a lower oil price environment. And how that might compare to the value proposition that H&P was able to initially deliver when they introduced the FlexRigs to the market over 10 years ago?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Okay. Kurt, thank you. I think, maybe to frame it up in one perspective is if you look at the ongoing rig count that we have right now, I don't know if it's 950, 970 depending on whose rig count service you look at. And you look at the number of rigs that are drilling horizontal and directional wells. And again, to keep in mind that that complexity of the well continues to increase. About 630 of the rigs that are drilling those wells are AC drive and about half of those are super-spec.","And then there's another 250 or 260 or so SCR and mechanical rigs that are drilling those same longer lateral and more complex wells. I'm assuming maybe they're not as complex. But I think when you consider that those rigs \u2013 that base rig design is a 1960s, 1970 design and technology, you have to believe that we're going to continue to see a trend towards more AC drive technology.","So, that speaks to a strong reason why we believe that we're going to continue to see high-grade opportunities. We're going to be able to high-grade on some of those rigs and even some of maybe lower performing AC rigs.","I mean, Kurt, really at the end of the day, the customer doesn't really care about whether the rig is AC drive or SCR. What he cares about is performance. And I think, over time, as customers see the value proposition, which really it exists today like it exist five years ago, which is, if we can deliver the well in fewer days, the customer can pay a higher day rate and actually save money on the well.","And so I think that value proposition holds today just like it held 5 years ago and 10 years ago. The difference now is that well complexity is much greater, which I think even expands the opportunities set forth.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. That's great explanation. Thanks. And maybe I've got a follow-up for Juan Pablo. Appreciate you kind of spelling out how you guys look at your capital structure and allocate the capital and think about the dividend vis-\u00e0-vis the debt dynamic.","And again, I was just wondering, Juan Pablo, if you might be able to provide a little bit more insight as to why you may not be, I don't know, comfortable or as willing to tap into some of the debt markets to maintain the dividend vis-\u00e0-vis tapping into, say, the debt markets to explore some M&A.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Sure, Kurt. I'll be glad to expand on that. I think that as the company reviews its capital allocation strategy and what we've done over the years, we've proven to be very prudent in that regard and always looking for opportunities to return cash to shareholders.","Over the years, of course, we've increased our dividend levels with the expectation that we could sustain those levels. But those assumptions were based on a cyclical business that would allow us to, with the benefit of our backlog and with the benefit of our flexibility in terms of CapEx, sustain very high dividend levels through the cycles.","However, if that assumption changes at some point and we see, as I mentioned, a prolonged down-cycle where opportunities to invest new cash in the business are scarce or are not there, then we will make sure that we manage that cash as responsibly as we can and not return more cash potentially than what the business can generate in that type of soft environment. So, in that type of very soft environment in the future, we would most probably look at adjusting our approach to the dividend.","However, as I mentioned, we do expect an improvement in the business. We do expect the cyclical nature of our industry to continue. And so, from that perspective and as far as we can see today, we are in great position to continue to sustain the dividend. We don't expect changes to our debt level. We are very pleased with how our EBITDA levels and our revenue levels have been improving. And we don't expect, again, given what we can see in the foreseeable future, that our cash levels will come down in a very significant level as we move forward.","So we were just trying to make sure that everybody understood that what our perspective would be regarding borrowing additional funds if we were to go into the described very soft scenario, and hopefully, that is helpful for everybody.","Operator","Our next question is from John Daniel from Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","Hey. Thanks for putting me in. Couple for you, Juan Pablo. Just first one would be, you cited a bunch of different contracted cash margins by year I think, and I'm moving very slow today, didn't fully catch what you said, or if you could just refresh that commentary, would be helpful.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Sure. So you've probably seen our backlog, as we've reported it over time, and it's a multi-year backlog. And given that we have the term contracts for new builds that were negotiated before the downturn now combined with term contracts that were priced during the downturn, it creates a little fluctuation that we wanted to provide a little more granularity for.","So let me give you a little bit more information and then expand on or repeat what I mentioned. On our U.S. Land segment for fiscal 2018, we expect an average of a little over 53 rigs that are already under term contract that is, the number for fiscal 2019 is a little under 20 rigs, and the number for fiscal 2020 is a little over 7 rigs, on average contracted during those years.","And what we've provided as an additional reference is the expected average rig margin per day for those rigs during those years that are already under contract. And those numbers for fiscal 2018 are $13,000 approximately, for fiscal 2019 are $14,500 and for fiscal 2020 are $15,500.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","Got it. Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Welcome.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","And the guidance for international, it refers to adjusted quarterly revenue days. Will there be any other incremental contribution for international from those five contracted rigs in terms of revenue days? I'm just trying to understand the adjusted concept.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Those five contracts are generating revenue days and will continue to generate revenue days, given that the customer withdrew that early termination notice. So, all 10 contracted rigs that we've been referring to in Argentina will continue to generate revenue days during the following quarter, including those 5. Does that address your question?","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","...you could have an incremental financial contribution from those other rigs, is that fair, like you did this quarter, sort of a bump, right?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, what we did for this quarter...","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","Yeah.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","...for the third fiscal quarter is we provided the adjusted level of activity, excluding retroactive adjustment. So the 13 rigs on average that were reflected as active in the adjusted numbers...","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","Yeah.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","...include the 5 rigs that you are referring to. So 13 rigs active on average in the third fiscal quarter and an expectation of the same 13 rigs being active during the fourth fiscal quarter.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","Okay. All right. Got it. And then just last one for me. You would care to take a guess at what bare bones CapEx might be next year, if you were to basically materially reduce rig upgrades?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, John, as you know, we haven't discussed that. I mean you clarified it without a lot of upgrades what was our beginning CapEx for last year \u2013 for 2017, for this year, I'm sorry.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We started at $200 million and we had a CapEx level of $257 million, I believe, for fiscal 2017. And then we started this year with an expectation...","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","2016.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you. Pardon me, fiscal 2016. We started this year with an estimate of $200 million and that has increased, given the upgrading opportunity that we've had.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","So I think to say in a bare bones, as John described it, I think those were reasonable ranges.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","Yeah. I'm only asking because then people worry about the dividend if you decided, hey, we just kind of ramped down our CapEx. Just from a modeling prospective, where could you take it at all for a short period of time?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think what we provided are reasonable references. The maintenance CapEx level that we've been commenting on related to our fiscal 2017 CapEx estimates is roughly around $100 million. So, that's another reference for your consideration.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company","That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, John. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Johnston of Nomura. Your line is open.","Matthew Johnston - Nomura","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Morning, Matt.","Matthew Johnston - Nomura","So, John, I just wanted to ask a question on your comment about being able to still push day rates higher even if the rig count is flat. I'm curious, what do you think the day rate trajectory looks like in a declining rig count environment.","Maybe not a precipitous fall, but if we were to lose a 100 to 150 rigs in the U.S. land market over the next few quarters, do you think you could still push day rates higher just because of the natural high-grading that still needs to take place within the fleet or is it more flattish? Or do you just lose all pricing power once the rig count starts to fall?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think, Matt, that's a great question. And obviously, we're making some assumptions. I think a part of your assumption is related to the lower end of the spectrum in terms of the fleet. I mean, it is a bifurcated fleet. The customer behaviors that we have seen are customers want more, not less, and they want higher performing rigs.","And so I think, in that sort of an environment, if you had a 100- or 150-rig pullback and it was on the lower end of the spectrum, and I don't see customers pulling back away from the performance that they need. I mean, the reality of it is with the performance that we're providing and the cost of the well, it's a very, very low number.","And so, again, our hope is that there's enough value proposition there to be able to just to support some pricing increases. I mean, let's face it, the pricing that we have today for the value that we're providing is on the low end of the spectrum. So, that's kind of our belief.","As well as the upgrades that we're making allow us to push pricing. We're not making these investments without some sort of a return. Now we may not have a term contract, but we do have an expectation the rig is going to have a higher day rate and the rig is going to work. We're not going to upgrade a rig and go out and drill one well.","We also have seen, when we do see churn, I mean I think that's the other thing to keep in mind, and we actually saw this as an industry in 2013. If you remember, when oil prices pulled back, the rig count remained relatively flat, up and down during the course of the year. And what we saw were significant high grades and, of course, the pricing, day rates were already pushed up to very high levels at that point. So, that portion of the equation is different.","But I think that's kind of our belief. We're going to continue to upgrade rigs as long as we have what we think is a decent rate of return and we can get a higher margin. And if we don't see that then we most likely won't be upgrading additional rigs until we see that sort of demand and that sort of pricing.","Matthew Johnston - Nomura","Got it. I appreciate all that insight. It's helpful. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on the OpEx side. Definitely good to see the outlook for next quarter and the U.S. Land segment fall below $14,000 per day.","As we look out over the next few quarters and into next year, do we need to see your rig count move higher before we think about OpEx per day moving lower? Or is there some room in a flat rig count environment for you to kind of grind a little bit closer to that $13,000-a-day level?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","That is a great question. I think that, as we've mentioned in the past, there have been two key contributors to the higher level of expense per day number that we've been seeing over the last several quarters. And the first one relates to upfront expenses on reactivating rigs and that, obviously, in a flatter environment would come down significantly, as we're expecting for the fourth fiscal quarter.","The other consideration relates to the stacked rigs that we have. And we have close to 160 AC drive FlexRigs that remain stacked, and those rigs have a small dollar number per day related to being stacked. And these are basically made up of property taxes, insurance, other minor maintenance security expenses, et cetera. And so, as we said during our comments, I think 3% to 4% of the $13,700 expectation relate to those stacked expenses.","And so, as you said, if we were to see a much higher level of activity or a higher level of activity, that would decline potentially significantly and allow us room to be closer to $13,000. But, at this point, we're very pleased to have seen the reductions that we have and to expect continued improvements.","The other piece of the equation is what happens to labor, what happens to maintenance and supplies going forward. We don't expect significant changes on those items. But, of course, the market will tell whether we can achieve that.","We've been very pleased with the significant improvements in terms of our ability to manage the supply chain. That has provided some room for improvement that has fortunately been able to offset some of the additional expenditures of having higher horsepower and higher expenses related to the rigs with greater capabilities that we have out there.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. Matt, I might agree with what Juan Pablo said, and I might just chip in. And he just touched on it a little bit, and you may have heard us say this before, but rigs are working harder today than they ever have. And so you're going through more expendables. The fact that we can get our costs in the levels that we have and even close to previous cycles is pretty amazing.","Our supply chain effort in a lot of ways has improved. But I think it also speaks to the question earlier related to day rates. I mean, the rigs are working hard. The rigs are delivering great value. Customers are taking advantage of that. It's great for them and for their wellbore. But the fact is we're having to spend more money on these rigs. So I think that's another element that supports a pricing improvement to cover those costs.","Matthew Johnston - Nomura","Got it. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it. Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Marc Bianchi of Cowen. Your line is open.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Hey. I wanted to take a step back and think maybe a little bit more strategically or ask how you're thinking strategically. It seems to be that perhaps the U.S. market is in a mature phase or perhaps entering a mature phase where there's not a lot of new build opportunity. Sure there's some upgrade, you're going to participate in that. But just as you think kind of longer term, you guys were ahead of the curve on the AC new build phase that occurred in the U.S. Maybe the next area of opportunity for efficiency gains is international.","So, given the balance sheet, given the capability that you have there, how does that play into the thoughts around capital allocation, perhaps expanding more aggressively internationally at this point?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, Marc, I think there's definitely some opportunities international. We've seen those over time. I mean, we all know a lot of the challenges associated with growing international. So we do have an effort focused on international and figuring out how we're going to compete more effectively internationally.","Obviously, international has been challenged as well. But I think, to your point about maybe being less mature on some of the efficiency improvements, I would agree with you. That's the reason why we have FlexRigs working in Argentina and the way that we do, because those rigs deliver great value. So I think there's an opportunity.","But I think in terms of technology just in general, and I think it starts in the U.S., and just our ability to continue to innovate to be able to drive higher levels of performance with technology additions. I think MOTIVE is an example of that. There's software solutions, there's data solutions, there's machine learning. There's still a lot of things we can do as it relates to reliability and improving that and kind of helping our people deliver the wells more efficiently, do it safer, and do it in a more reliable fashion.","So I think there's still opportunities for investment from that perspective as well.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sure. I suppose, if you were to look more aggressively at the international market than you are right now, would it be more likely a new build opportunity for you or are there M&A opportunities that you're tracking that seem interesting?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Most of the M&A opportunities that you see internationally are pretty old assets. And even if there are some newer assets, it's also coupled with a lot of older assets as well. I think for us, we would not need to build \u2013 for instance, if it were a FlexRig application, a Flex3, Flex4 or Flex5, which we have Flex3s and Flex4s of course working internationally, we can expand with the existing fleet that we have on the ground here. Juan Pablo talked about the availability that we have here where we have that same scalability internationally.","I think the exception would be, if you were looking at a different design or a higher horsepower offering or some other new build opportunity, which I don't know if there's any out there right now, maybe some of the larger 3,000-horsepower rigs would be an opportunity. But I think, right now, at least with the rig counts that we have, the industry is going to be pretty hard-pressed to get into a new build mode, because I think new-build economics, just the pricing that's required is a long way from where we need to be.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sure. That makes sense, John. Thanks a lot. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Marc. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob MacKenzie of IBERIA Capital. Your line is open.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Thank you, guys. John, my question is kind of a follow-up on the last one, if I may. There have been some out in the industry that have been arguing for potentially larger rigs to work on multi-well pads in the U.S. that can handle longer laterals, all the hydraulics and stuff associated with that.","Do you see the demand for that, the argument for that? And if so, does your argument about the efficiency of modern rigs today, wouldn't that apply to a potential new build that can drill on a multi-well pad more effectively?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, there are some significantly deeper wells that we have been drilling. Actually, in our press release, on the second bullet or the third \u2013 I think it's the third page, we recently drilled a 27,750-foot well, had a lateral of almost 20,000 feet. And we did that with the FlexRig5. We've had FlexRig3s that have drilled 25,000-foot measured depth wells.","So I think it's the perspective that you're looking at it from. If you're looking at it from a contractor who has a much smaller fleet or a lesser capacity fleet, then I think that is what their response will have to be in many cases, is they're going to have to build new or they're going to have to have a significant upgrade of some sort.","These types of wells don't \u2013 these aren't 2,000 or 3,000 horsepower requirement jobs. Most of the capacity is related to the setback and related to the hydraulics, and the top drive horsepower.","Does that answer your question?","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Yes.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","There are some really super laterals out there. Most of those are gas plays. This was a gas play, not an oil play. Not all \u2013 in fact, I think, very few of the acreage positions in the oil basins would provide for this level of extended reach work. I think we're seeing some 10,000 and 12,000 feet, but I don't know that we've seen anything like this in most of the more active plays.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","No. Great. That is very helpful. Thank you for the commentary there. I appreciate it. That does it for my questions.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Gruber, Citigroup. Your line is open.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Morning, Scott.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Morning.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","John, you made a strong case earlier on the ability to increase the penetration of AC rigs even in a flat market. If we just think about the super-spec class, a competitor of yours on an earlier call quoted 465 super-spec rigs in existence today, if I caught their number correctly. And that would be relative to about 800 shale rigs running according to Baker, which does suggest obviously that there's a long runway to push these super-spec units into the market.","I'm wondering where we hit saturation. Not every well needs a super-spec rig. How should we think about that? How do you guys think about it?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, it's a great question and I know a lot of people are wondering about that. I think, at least our internal studies and results, we think we're more in the low-300 range of super-spec rigs and maybe 325 to 350 super-spec rigs rather than the 465 super-spec rigs. I would be interested to see that report just to see how those rigs are broken out. And you're talking about not super-spec capable, but already upgraded to super-spec, is that what you're saying?","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's correct. And I'd have to go back and check. They may have quoted 365. I was trying to just check it before I mentioned it and couldn't do so.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. So I think the way we do see it though is that there's about 600 to 650 rigs we think are capable of being upgraded to super-spec capacity. And so, a little over half of those are upgraded today. And so I think in an 800-rig count environment with only 600 or so super-spec capable rigs, that's a pretty tight market.","I mean, I just see customers today that would never even had an AC rig running, much less an upgraded rig with the kind of capacity that we're talking about today. Some smaller players, even some midsize to even some larger players today that previously weren't focused on AC drive technology, they see it today. They understand the value proposition. We've attracted over 20- some-odd customers over the last 9 months, 12 months or so. So it's got some traction. And so I think we're going to continue to see that adoption going forward.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Is there a well footage where you start to see the demand from clients shifts strongly towards super-spec? Is there a way we can demarcate it by footage?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","There's a lot of \u2013 I wish it were that easy because there are so many variables. But one of the things we have seen is, when a lateral length reaches around 7,500 to 8,000 feet, in some basins, not in all basins, but in some basins that's where we've began to kind of max out on the limitation of the 5,000 psi kind of the standard mud pump system.","In some cases, the top drives that are in use, the pressure ratings. There's various things like that that we've seen, but it's not a hard and fast rule by any stretch. But I think at least the latest \u2013 Dave, correct me if I'm wrong, the latest data, the average lateral is still just around 7,000 feet.","David Hardie - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","That's correct.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","And so, if you look at it on an average basis, we still have a ways to go to push that. But there are a lot of operators out there, obviously, that are drilling 8,000-, 12,000-, even 15,000-foot laterals, which is far and away above the average.","So, as you see that average being pushed to 8,000, to 9000 feet, then I think in that stage you'll begin to see even more requirements for the super-spec-type rigs. At least that's the assumption that we're making. We're having to make some assumptions because we just don't have the entire data set in order to make that decision.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Well, it seems reasonable. Appreciate it. Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Scott. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Morning, Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, just to stick on the upgrade topic, can you maybe give us a sense of how the paybacks look on the walking systems? And maybe when you have to do that entire package, say, $7 million, $8 million, just curious if it's been maybe a three- to four-year range. And then what type of contracts were you able to put against those upgrades?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We've had a range on the contracts \u2013 I don't remember \u2013 it seems like they were 18 months to two year on a couple of the contracts. The very first rig is in the spot market. These are low-20s type day rate. So it's going to be a function of what assumption you make on what the length of the activity for those rigs. We think we're going to get a return, really haven't cranked through all the numbers on that, Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. But its' going to be similar to what we've attained in the past, very attractive returns from a ROIC perspective during the terms of the contract. And then if we make an assumption that those rigs continue to work at similar day rates, I think it is fair to assume that paybacks will also be similar to what we've seen in new builds in the past, if you take into account the incremental investment on those rigs...","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. I think...","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","...and the return on that.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Sean, the other thing to keep in mind is the demand for those rigs. I mean, we're trying to create demand for that. Most of the demand has been in the Northeast, and some of these in the gas plays, Utica as well as the Marcellus. There hasn't been as much demand for that in the oil basins, particularly in the Permian and the Eagle Ford.","So we're going to see how that plays out. Again, we're not going to build those rigs on spec per se. We're just expecting that the business is going to come our way. We're going to see how that works. But, again, the good news for us is we have four out of the five committed at this time, and we'll continue to watch that.","We continue to have demand for Flex3s with skid systems and upgrade packages. That continues to go on as well. So, again, it kind of goes back to that family of solutions opportunity. We can fit the rig to meet the customers' needs.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. No, that's very helpful. And so then it's interesting, one of your competitors announced today that they're going to upgrade some 1000-horsepower rigs to 1,500 super-spec status, costs about $8 million, similar paybacks to what you just mentioned I think.","So now we're going through the trouble of reworking the substructure, et cetera. These are things that I think a year or so ago, and talking to folks in the industry, that seem to be a bit more of a challenge. Isn't there some risk that maybe this super-spec capable capacity market is a bit bigger than what was laid out here?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","So, that's kind of the million-dollar question, isn't it? I mean, how big a market is it? I'm not certain exactly how to get our arms around that. I mean obviously, our customers, at least the intent seems to be to drill longer laterals. And so I think in that environment, it makes sense.","A high quality rig that delivers a lot of value, meaning saves days, is safe and is reliable with great people, is worth a lot of money. And so I think, when you look at it from that perspective and the total well cost, it makes sense that there's some additional upgrade capacity out there. At least that's what we've seen.","But, again, we're not going to continue to build or upgrade rigs without their being a market and some sort of commitment or expectation that we're going to get a good return on our investment.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Okay. Thank you for the time, guys.","Operator","At this time, I'd be happy to return the conference back over to Mr. John Lindsay for any concluding remarks.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Leo. I just want to reemphasize and kind of close out that we're confident about the opportunities ahead.

[Operator Instructions]","Please note, this call maybe recorded. I will be standing-by, if you should need any assistance. It is now pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan Pablo Tardio.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, and welcome everyone, to Helmerich & Payne\u2019s conference call and webcast corresponding to the second quarter of fiscal 2015 The speakers\u2019 today will be John Lindsay, President and CEO, and me, Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO. Also with us today is Dave Hardie, Manager of Investor Relations.","As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the Company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The Company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today\u2019s press release.","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. The results corresponding to our second fiscal quarter were stronger than expected during this very turbulent time. Low oil prices continue to depress demand levels for drilling services during the transition into our third fiscal quarter. Even with oil prices rebounding from the lows reached earlier this year, our customers have continued to release rigs, albeit at a slower pace.","Although there appears to be some stabilization in the oil macro outlook, there is still uncertainty in the market, and our customers remain cautious. The industry rig count decline has been more swift and severe than we expected at the time of our last earnings call in late January, and we reviewed at that time as being more bearish than most.","While we don\u2019t believe we have reached the absolute bottom yet, we do believe there are indications that the trough is nearing. Several industry analysts have predicted a trough count ranging from 850 rigs to 750 rigs in the U.S. land market, and we believe that is a reasonable fairway given today\u2019s oil price environment, and the discussions we have had with customers.","We have commented that rig count reductions have been indiscriminate, and that trend continues. Yet even in an environment where customers are releasing rigs based upon their liquidity, as well as economic considerations, in many cases regardless of a rig\u2019s performance, we estimate that approximately 40% of the sidelined rigs are mechanical rigs, and that approximately 31% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs make up approximately 29%.","Despite the reductions in our activity, there may be another sign that the market is establishing a bottom. We have recently contracted a handful of FlexRigs in the spot market to customers who are trading up, high-grading rigs in their drilling programs. Horizontal well complexity and factory-type drilling requirements in the ongoing U.S. energy revolution have changed the game for drilling contractors and other service providers. As a result, fewer mechanical and SCR rigs will be required in the future, especially in the rig categories below 2,000 horsepower drawworks rating.","This morning we announced the decommissioning of our first and second generation FlexRigs. These 17 SCR powered rigs built in 1998 and 2001 were a very important strategic move in the Company\u2019s history. The belief was that our customers would be willing to pay a higher day rate for a safer and more efficient rig, and the success of that strategy led to H&P\u2019s investment in AC drive FlexRigs, and I will talk more about that in a moment.","Even though the Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs were a dramatic improvement over the legacy rig fleet, it has become evident SCR power isn\u2019t the preferred technology for today\u2019s more complex well design. What customers want is AC drive technology. Now back to designing and building the first AC drive FlexRig, where we began with a clean sheet of paper and safety-by-design rig structures, and powered the design with AC drive technology. The value proposition to our customers was compelling, and the market finally embraced our efforts. ","We recognized a long time ago that eventually other contractors would build AC rigs to compete with H&P. We often get the question, are you concerned about your peers\u2019 new AC drive rigs? We answer that by saying, our strategy has remained focused, build the best rigs, employ the best people, and create support systems and processes that continue to deliver the FlexRigs value proposition to our customers. The future holds many opportunities for H&P. The FlexRig 3, FlexRig 4, and FlexRig 5 make up approximately 37% of the AC drive market share in the U.S. today, and FlexRigs have an opportunity to take market share internationally as well.","Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, let me mention a key element of our Company culture. Our focus on continuous improvement and building a learning organization is a key advantage in both the highs and lows of the energy cycle. I am proud of what our people accomplished in 2014 for our customers, where we drilled over 71 million feet of wellbore, and operated over 325 rigs at the peak of activity in October of last year.","In addition to setting records for footage and rig activity, our people continue to work on innovative technology solutions, safety systems, cost control systems, and processes that position the Company to be better prepared today than ever before. And certainly, better than we were in the 2009 downturn.","The organization\u2019s response to this very severe reduction in rig count has been significant. Our field operations to date have idled over 150 rigs, taking care to preserve the rig and equipment integrity, so we are ready to respond when the market improves. I believe our experienced leadership team provides us with an advantage to manage through the current downturn, even more efficiently and effectively than during previous cycles.","Let me close by saying, equally important to the tactical side of our business is our continued strategic focus on organizational effectiveness during these difficult times. We will continue to invest in systems and processes which will allow us to efficiently scale operations to meet changing industry conditions, and be prepared with our significant AC fleet capability to respond quickly to future demand levels. We believe this makes H&P the best-positioned drilling contractor in the industry today.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call to Juan Pablo, and he will give you more details on the second fiscal quarter, and the outlook for our next quarter. Juan Pablo?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. The Company reported $150 million in net income, $227 million in operating income, and $883 million in revenues during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Given the steep downturn that the industry is experiencing, these quarterly levels were down significantly as compared to the prior quarter, and are expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter. Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments.","Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $225 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. As expected, the number of quarterly revenue days significantly declined, resulting in an average of approximately 231 active rigs during the second fiscal quarter, representing a 24% decline in revenue days as compared to the first fiscal quarter.","On average, approximately 158 of these rigs were under term contracts, and approximately 73 rigs worked in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day decreased by 3.6% to $27,575, and the average rig expense per day increased by 2.7% to $13,395, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $14,190. During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $71 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations.","Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $75 million during the third fiscal quarter and over $30 million after that in early termination revenues. Since November of last year, we have received termination notices for a total of 44 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 44 contracts are now estimated at approximately $204 million, approximately $90 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $65 million during fiscal 2016, and $49 million after that.","As of today, the 336 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 165 AC drive FlexRigs generating revenue, and 171 idle rigs, including 163 idle AC drive FlexRigs. Included in the 165 rigs generating revenue are 138 rigs under term contracts, and 27 rigs in the spot market. The 165 rigs generating revenue include rigs that are on stand-by type day rates, and some new build deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. ","Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by about 32% quarter-to-quarter. And given the current trend, we could have approximately 150 rigs or less generating revenue days by the end of the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to roughly $27,000. The average rig expense per day is expected at roughly $13,600.","Subject to additional early terminations, and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, this segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 130 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, an average of about 117 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, and an average of about 107 rigs and 79 rigs during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.","The average rig margin per day level for these rigs that are already under term contract is expected to remain strong and roughly flat during the next several quarters, as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed. The pricing for rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 15% from the first to the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and it\u2019s expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is about 23% lower, as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.","Let me now transition to our offshore segment. Segment operating income declined to approximately $19 million from $21 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days decreased by about 2%, as one rig was demobilized and became idle during the second fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day declined by about 10% to $18,671 during the second fiscal quarter, as one rig that continues to generate revenue days while stacked on the customer\u2019s platform had a significant day rate and margin reduction. Eight of the Company\u2019s nine offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days by the end of the second fiscal quarter.","As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decline by about 10%, as one of the eight rigs generating revenue completes its current project, is demobilized, and becomes idle during the quarter. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $12,000 during the quarter.","The expected average rig margin decline is mostly attributable to three rigs that are generating revenue days during the third fiscal quarter, but that are now expected to be idled on the corresponding customer offshore platforms, with new day rates and margins that are significantly lower as compared to regular operating day rates and margins. A total of seven of the Company\u2019s nine offshore platform rigs are now expected to be generating revenue days at the end of the third fiscal quarter.","Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $8 million, and is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the third fiscal quarter. ","Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income decreased to approximately $6 million during the quarter. Excluding the impact of $373 per day corresponding to early contract termination revenues, the average rig margin per day slightly decreased to $10,524. As expected, quarterly revenue days decreased by about 11% to an equivalent of slightly over 20 active rigs.","As of today, our international land segment has 21 active rigs, including 12 in Argentina, 4 in Columbia, 2 in the UAE, 2 in Ecuador, and 1 in Bahrain. 17 rigs are idle, including 3 that are under contract, but no longer active. These 17 rigs include 5 in Argentina, 4 in Ecuador, 4 in Columbia, 2 in Bahrain, and 2 in Tunisia. An additional two rigs are mobilizing to field locations in Argentina.","For the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to be flat, potentially increasing up to 5%. We expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 15% to 20% as compared to the second fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations. We expect to generate early termination revenues in this segment of approximately $9 million during the third fiscal quarter, and another $9 million during the fourth fiscal quarter corresponding to two rigs that are under contract but no longer active.","The expected daily margin decline in this segment is primarily due to rigs that are in transition and others becoming idle. We expect to see all 10 of the YPF project rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. ","Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our liquidity position is very strong. We recently issued 10 year unsecured notes for $500 million with 4.65% coupons, and a 4.723% yield. Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2015 remains at approximately $1.3 billion, about 70% of which corresponds to the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. ","Our fiscal 2015 construction cadence plan remains unchanged, but we are reducing our fiscal 2016 cadence to one FlexRigs per month beginning in October through March, which allows us to have greater new build continuity as we go through this downturn, while at the same time not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog. Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during all of fiscal 2015, and the additional 6 rigs scheduled for fiscal 2016, we have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 148 rigs across our three drilling segments during the third fiscal quarter and approximately 134 rigs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.","In addition, an average of about 121 rigs is already under contract during fiscal 2016, and an average of approximately 93 rigs during fiscal 2017. The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable, as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments.","Given the trend in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014, to approximately $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2015. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the third fiscal quarter, as we earn related income through operations or through early contract terminations. We expect our total annual depreciation expense to be approximately $600 million during fiscal 2015, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $140 million.","Interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to be approximately $15 million for fiscal 2015, and the effective tax rate for the remaining two quarters of 2015 is expected to be between 34% and 35%. Our deferred income tax liability as of March 31, 2015, was approximately $1.32 billion. At this point, we expect this liability to remain in the range of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion through at least the end of fiscal 2017.","With that, let me turn the call back to John.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo. Before opening the call to questions, I want to reiterate a few key points. As we manage through the current decline in activity, our fleet size provides us with a distinct advantage. With the largest AC drive fleet available in the industry today, the Company has unprecedented leverage to significantly increase activity levels during a future industry recovery and ongoing replacement cycle. ","In addition to our fleet advantage, H&P has over 1,600 rig years of AC drive experience. This experience provides a foundation to deliver superior value to our customers by providing innovative solutions, and safer, more productive operations. We expect these efforts, along with the Company\u2019s demonstrated capital discipline, to continue to result in pricing, margin, and return on investment premiums that allow us to create value for our shareholders.","Now, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kurt Hallead","Hi, good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","So if I heard you correctly, you mentioned that you are decommissioning 17 of your earlier edition Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs.

The Flex 1s and 2s \u2013 and I think you recognize this \u2013 what I am getting ready to say, but the Flex 1s and 2s were SCR rigs. They were also rigs that we didn\u2019t design the structures on the rig. They were bought through kind of the traditional sourcing in the marketplace. Those rigs haven\u2019t worked, really the last couple of years.","We have had some different opportunities potentially sell those rigs. But really, the Flex 3s, 4s and 5s, the Flex 3s that we built in 2002 to 2004, if you recall the first 32 we built, those rigs have continued to work, they\u2019re both spot and term. They have been in a situation where they have typically commanded the same type of revenues and margins that we have seen with our newer Flex 3s. Some have skid systems and some don\u2019t. It\u2019s kind of a mixed bag. But I feel real good about where we are, in terms of drilling with those rigs going forward. ","We do have \u2013 I just want to remind you too \u2013 we do have eight 3,000 horsepower SCR rigs, one of which we worked at the end of last year on a deep project, a deep gas project in Louisiana. We will continue to have those rigs. We have 2,000 and 3,000 horsepower SCR rigs working in South America. And then, of course, we have our first 3,000 horsepower AC rig also working in South America, working in Columbia.","So I feel good about where we are. I think those rigs that \u2013 we\u2019ve continued to upgrade those rigs over time, in just about every way possible. They continue to deliver great value for customers, and I feel good about where we are with those rigs.","Kurt Hallead","Great. And how do you \u2013 a lot of questions on many fronts here about, hey, we have got a lot \u2013 a first time where we are going through a cycle downturn with significant excess capacity in Tier 1 rigs. What is it going to look like coming out the other side, the prospect of those rigs maybe not finding work? How do you assess coming out of the other side of the cycle recovery, and given the excess capacity in Tier 1 land rigs, how would you expect pricing to behave in this cycle, versus maybe what you experienced back in 2012, 2013?","John Lindsay","Well, clearly, today is a different market than what we saw in 2012 and 2013. Today is, obviously, a lot more similar to the downturn at the end of 2008, and going into 2009, and first part of 2010. Of course, as you said, I think we had 15% of the active fleet at the peak in 2008 that was AC drive. So it is going to be a different environment.","It\u2019s hard to say exactly where pricing will be. I think our expectation would be, in the spot market similar to what we saw in 2009, where it would be in a high teens range. The rigs that we are going to be competing against, yes, there will be some head-to-head competition with AC on AC. But you still have a significant number of SCR and mechanical rigs that are out working today, drilling unconventional resource plays that really aren\u2019t designed to adequately address the challenges, and deliver the type of cycle times that an AC rig can deliver.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, that\u2019s great. Thank you, John.","John Lindsay","All right. Thanks, Kurt.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Angie Sedita of UBS.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Good morning.","Angie Sedita","So, John, just going further into the outlook for 2016, and obviously what we\u2019re seeing today, if you think about a modest recovery in 2016, how easy or challenging do you think it will be to get these rig crews back? Is it a bottleneck? Or do you think that you won\u2019t have a problem bringing them back on?","John Lindsay","Well, Angie, I think we have done a \u2013 this isn't the first significant downturn we have been through. I just mentioned the 2008, 2009 downturn, and we responded coming out of that very well. I think our peak rig count in 2008 was about 185, and we got down to a little over 100 rigs. Of course, this time we're \u2013 we got close to 300 rigs working in the US, and we are down to 160.","Our experience is that the rigs go back to work. We have a lot of experienced, skilled personnel on the rigs that are working in a lot of cases lower positions. So those guys are always eager to move up into that next role, that next slot, and I personally don't think it's going to be a challenge.","The other advantage that we have in our business, of course, is that when you compare the earnings that a guy can have working a year in a oil field, compared to building houses or other types of competitive jobs, there is really not a great comparison. And so, I think people are typically eager to come back.","And I think with H&P specifically, we have created a lot of job opportunities and upward mobility, and our guys have seen that through the cycles. We have grown more quickly than our peers, and when we have that kind of growth, we promote from within, and those guys have opportunities to move up in the organization. That's a long-winded answer to your question. But I don't think we are going to have a challenge, personally.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, Juan Pablo, this is probably question for you, and I\u2019ve had the question asked to me. So given the current market environment, how much of a focus does the dividend, the commitment to the dividend going forward? Obviously, you have more liquidity. You just did the debt offering. So just share some comments there, and your thoughts going forward?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Sure, Angie. We've said in the past, that every time that the Company looks at the possibility of increasing dividends as we have, of course, over the last few years especially, the sustainability of that dollar per share amount is a very important consideration. We look at different scenarios and stress cases to determine whether or not we feel comfortable with the sustainability of those new levels, and we certainly do feel comfortable and continue to feel comfortable that we will be in good position to continue to pay those dividends for the foreseeable future.","Potentially, hopefully, as the industry and market recovers, we might have a situation where we once again increase it. Of course, there may be situations in the mid to long-term that are unexpected, that may be extreme, that may represent a structural change in the business that we might have to look at, and determine whether at that point there may be a change. But as far as we can see, we are very comfortable with the sustainability and our commitment to the dividends.","Angie Sedita","Great. Thanks. Very helpful. I will turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robin Shoemaker","Thank you. John, I wanted to go back to one of your earlier statements about, you said recently you have put some AC drive rigs in the spot market that have replaced older rigs. So the kind of high-grading process that you were predicting has \u2013 seems to be starting to happen. So I wonder if you could talk about the rate that \u2013 of the rig that you are replacing, are you getting a higher rate? And is the value proposition still there in this kind of market environment on newly signed contracts?","John Lindsay","Yes, Robin. The rigs that we have replaced are, in some cases, legacy rigs. In other cases, I think they were \u2013 in one of the cases, it was kind of a lower-end performing AC rig, and the day rates that we received \u2013 I know in the legacy rig case, it was a higher rate. I am assuming it was on the other rig as well. They were high teen type rates, kind of what we've talked about.","The value proposition is clearly there. I mean, you have seen our value proposition slide that we have shown for years, where we're saving 10%, 15%, 20% on a well. We have a higher day rate, and we are able to save the customer money, as well as deliver more wells in a given year by working that rig.","So our belief continues to be that there will be a replacement cycle, the replacement cycle will continue. However, again, I've stated too, it's just a handful of rigs. Unfortunately, we still have more rigs becoming idle than rigs we are putting back in the market. But at least it is an encouraging sign that we hadn't seen in a couple of months anyway.","Robin Shoemaker","Yes. Right. So one of your latest presentations shows the AC drive market share at about 51%. So as we get to the bottom of the market, will it still be around that percentage? It still leaves a large number of rigs to be displaced ultimately by the Tier 1 rigs. So do you see that, this very early signs that you have noted, are there more people interested \u2013 you\u2019re talking to more people interested in doing that, as we get to the bottom of the market, and perhaps stabilize somewhere at that level?","John Lindsay","That would be our expectation, Robin. I think the AC drive market share today in the current active fleet is approximately 54%. So it's up slightly from what you quoted, from the previous presentation. I think it will probably continue to increase. And then, what you'll see over time, of course, is that as older \u2013 because there are some older rigs, legacy rigs, and then underperforming rigs that are on term contract, that as they roll off there is a possibility that those rigs could be high-graded.","So that would be our expectation. That's what we saw in 2009 and 2010. Our customers, operators in general, are looking for an opportunity. The other advantage to this type of a market is the ability to attract new customers. In 2009 and 2010, we were able to attract a lot of new customers to H&P, because they didn't have to sign a three-year term contract. They didn't have to wait in line. They were able to grab an available FlexRig, and put it to work, and test drive it and see how it worked out.","Another data point is in the horizontal and directional market, AC rigs have approximately 59% market share. So again, you can just see that there is another large percentage of rigs that are mechanical and SCR rigs that are drilling horizontal and directional, that are drilling some pretty challenging, complex wells. So that offers a great upside for us.","Robin Shoemaker","Yes. Right. Okay. Thank you, John.","John Lindsay","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Wilson of Howard Weil.","Dave Wilson","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Kind of want to stick with this \u2013 the thought of the value proposition, and looking a little longer-term. But John, is there a scenario where maybe some less competitive rigs stick around, because operators choose them? Because on price, for example, if those rigs are going for $12,000 a day, and an AC type rig is going for $18,000 to $20,000 a day, is that $6,000 gap there in the day rate, is that enough to sway an operator to stick with a less competitive rig? Do you have a sense of that?","John Lindsay","Well, Dave, our experience would tell us that if the operator is sticking with that lower tier rig, they are giving up some value. Because, and again, we have heard this from many customers \u2013 or pardon me \u2013 many competitors over the years, that as they began to get the picture that they needed a more advanced rig to compete in the marketplace, oftentimes they would say \u2013 and these were leaders within their organizations \u2013 would say we can't charge a rate low enough, that is compelling for an operator to pick that rig up because of the value proposition. So we believe that it's clear and that it's there.","It doesn't mean that we're implying that there won't ever be \u2013 or there won't be mechanical and SCR rigs working in the future. I think that there will be, but I do think it's going to be a fewer number. We talked about it on our last call. You can go back and review the notes. I am not going to try to recap it. But with each successive peak and trough, with each successive cycle, you see fewer and fewer mechanical and SCR rigs dating back to 2005, and that trend will continue.","One of the components, in addition to customers that's important \u2013 and I didn't touch on this earlier when Angie asked the question about people \u2013 and that is, the new rigs, AC drive FlexRigs are so much better to work on. They are safer. They are more environmentally conducive to working on. It's just an easier work environment, and so, and that has a real attraction to people. So you are going to get the best people that are going to be working on the newer rigs, which puts a lot of pressure again on rigs that were designed in the 1970s \u2013 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.","Dave Wilson","Got you. Thanks for clearing that up. I will turn the call back over.","John Lindsay","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Gruber of Citigroup.","Scott Gruber","Good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","I would like to get your opinion on the macro outlook here over the next 6, 12 months, starting to look beyond the trough which appears to be nearing. We have heard from some other industry participants this morning, general unwillingness to call an inflection point, at least in the second half of the year. But as I think about it, and I take your 800 or so trough number of rigs working in the U.S. which seems reasonable, it\u2019s a peak to trough drop of about 60%. This actually appears on par, if not in excess of the drop in E&P cash flow.","More importantly, the E&Ps haven\u2019t adjusted their activity levels to the improvement in spending power that has come through the system. I realize this takes time, but why doesn\u2019t this happen in the second half of the year? Should we expect \u2013 do you expect a decent rebound in activity before year end, call it, 100 plus rigs, once we\u2019ve cleared what I assume is a modest backlog of uncompleted wells? Just thinking through the impact of this improvement in spending power, and certainly the capital markets are open to the E&Ps. So just interested in your outlook on the rebound potential before year end?","John Lindsay","Well, Scott, this is John. Thank goodness, I don't get paid to make predictions on oil and gas prices. But our sense is, like we talked about in our opening comments, our sense is, it feels like we are finding a floor. As you know, there are so many variables involved and things that are unexpected that could happen, which is why I think again, we continue to see our customers being cautious. ","But you're right. We said \u2013 we talked about it on our last call, that markets work and eventually they work, and oil prices have a tendency to overshoot on the high side and the low side. There is a lot of forces working out there that could potentially contribute to exactly what you said. And so, I think your reasoning is right on target.","It's just a very difficult situation to try to call it. I think there are a lot of people out there now, that seem to be leaning more towards the second half of the year, and the first part of 2016, and starting to see some improvement. And so, I think that's a reasonable assumption. But I sure don't want to try to call it.","Scott Gruber","We\u2019ll just have to wait and see. And just thinking about the future of the domestic drilling industry, I think we can all agree that AC drive rigs drilling horizontal wells will certainly dominate the marketplace, but only a small subset of drilling companies can really execute this type of activity efficiently. Is there any thought to going out and purchasing an AC rig competitor at this point, consolidate the industry, before you really squeeze out the conventional activity, and potentially face roadblocks in terms of market concentration issues?","John Lindsay","Scott, we've talked about that, thought about it a lot over time, and you've heard us talk about one of the key advantages that we have as a Company is our fleet uniformity, and standardization of practices and supply chain, training, those types of things. I think, at least for H&P, it would be somewhat dilutive for us to acquire a competitor. Again, we've thought through it, whether it's a small competitor or large. In any event, it ends up having a dilutive effect.","We would prefer to continue to grow the Company organically. We see some real synergies associated with having the fleet that we have, and that's part of what we're speaking to, as we talk about processes and systems as we move forward. So but does to make sense from an industry perspective? I think it does. I think there is probably some logical combinations out there. I don't know who it would be, but I am sure there is some logical opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bradley Handler","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Bradley Handler","A couple different kinds of questions from me, I guess. The first is, maybe I missed it, and I just want to be clear. Is it your sense \u2013 you talk about how spot pricing has fallen. You have mentioned high teens, and you are placing some rigs there. Is it your sense \u2013 I know you are not calling the trough per se in activity, but is it your sense perhaps rates on the spot market have troughed? Or do you expect to go \u2013 the potential to go below the high teens in terms of placing AC rigs?","John Lindsay","Brad, I think we \u2013 you heard us \u2013 you probably heard us comment before. We talked about it on the last call, that there really isn't \u2013 there hasn't been a spot market per se. We are starting to see a little bit of a spot market develop now. I mean, obviously, it's going to come down to competitors deciding at what level they are going to price rigs at.","I think for us right now, we are down \u2013 like Juan Pablo said, we are down, 23% spot pricing. To remind you, in 2009, spot pricing was down approximately 30% from the peak. So we've kind of thought that 30% was a reasonable type of an estimate. I am not \u2013 I don't think we can call a bottom on spot market pricing at this stage of the game, because I think we are still really early in on developing the spot market.","However, I will say, I think an interesting point keep in mind, is that while we have 30% market share of the AC, our next three largest peers have approximately 38%. So 75% is \u2013 of market share of AC, is by four contractors, and then there is approximately 20 that make up the next, the other 25%. So it's a relatively small group of competitors out there. And so, you would think there would be some pricing discipline.","I know I have heard some of our larger peers talk about that, and being willing to defend a certain level of pricing. So that would be our expectation going forward. But it's\u2013 I don't think we are in a position where we can call the trough on spot market pricing.","Bradley Handler","Okay. Appreciate that. The related follow-up, and I guess it is really is an extension of the same kind of question is \u2013 I don\u2019t admittedly know how much of that there is, but we are hearing some conversations around E&Ps subcontracting rigs, that they are not using. And so, I guess, to your comment at least for the near-term, as it relates to a relatively limited number of suppliers, perhaps it\u2019s a bit of a bigger number than that? Is that something you are seeing as well? Do you have any perspective on that for us, and is it creating some additional potential pressure on rates?","John Lindsay","We have seen this through the cycles. I remember back in 2009, 2010, I think there was some. We saw it again, I think, in 2012 and 2013. But at least from my sense, it's not a large number. I think there may be a few that we have had recently. But it's less than a handful. It's just not a large number. So I don't have a feel for industry-wide. But my sense would be, that it wouldn't be that large.","Bradley Handler","Not impacting the market that much?","John Lindsay","Right. And particularly, as the \u2013 if the market were to improve and oil prices were to improve, and budgets were able to expand, I think you would probably see less of that.","Bradley Handler","Right. Right. Very good. Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it back.","John Lindsay","Thanks, Brad.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill of SunTrust.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, one question. On the rigs that went back to work, what type of rigs were these, and you may have said it, and I may have missed it, and I apologize.","John Lindsay","I think they were Flex3s and Flex5s. I guess it was \u2013 we had Flex3s, Flex4s and Flex5s combination.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. Which class rig do you have the most availability for?","John Lindsay","FlexRig 3s.","Chase Mulvehill","3s?","John Lindsay","Yes. We have what is our number close to 200 overall got available, but overall. So that would be our largest.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. All right. And then, of the stand by rigs, are you seeing any customers put these back to work yet, or at least inquire about putting these back to work?","John Lindsay","Can you repeat the question? I\u2019m sorry.","Chase Mulvehill","Yes, on the stand-by \u2013 well, do you have stand-by rigs? Do you have any rigs on stand-by right now?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Scott, this is Juan Pablo. We, as we mentioned, we have some of the active rigs, or rigs that are generating revenue, are not actually operating. They are under stand-by type rates. Yes, we do have a few of those.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. So I guess, my question would be, are you seeing customers put these back to work, or at least ask you about, hey, putting these back to work in the next few months?","Juan Pablo Tardio","I don't think right now, we have heard any. I think what we \u2013 I think you are going to have to see a stronger oil price environment more than likely. I can't speak to all of the details of it. But right now, I don't think that there is any that we are having those conversations with.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. All right. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","John Lindsay","All right Chase, thanks.","Juan Pablo Tardio","I\u2019m sorry, Chase, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Curran of FBR Capital Markets.","Thomas Curran","Good morning, guys.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Thomas Curran","Hey, John. Last time, I attempted to back into it sticking with the FlexRig 3 fleet. I estimated that about 32% of the FlexRig 3 fleet was equipped with skidding systems. Could you speak to where that percentage stands now? And then are you continuing to outfit those rigs with skidding systems throughout the downturn whether they\u2019re currently active or not?","John Lindsay","I'll start with the second part of your question first, while we're looking the information up. We are. We have continued to deliver \u2013 first of all, new builds with skid systems, as well as we are adding skid systems to Flex 3s that are working in the field today. I think \u2013 you said 37%. I was thinking it was 40% to 45%. So we're gaining on it. ","Thomas Curran","Okay. That would actually be consistent with the progress...","John Lindsay","Right.","Thomas Curran","I imagine you would have made since I last looked at it. Is there a percentage that you are planning not to outfit, and if so, is it because there is some that you\u2019ve already marked for potential deployment internationally?","John Lindsay","Well, we've actually had Flex 3s deploy internationally with skid systems. And so, we have Flex 3s working internationally, both with and without skid systems. It's really \u2013 I would say, it's a demand pull basis, not all customers are doing pad drilling. And so, it's just going to be a function of \u2013 as customers transition from single well pads, or and going into a more multi-well pad layout, then that's when we add the skid system to the rig, and those customers want to keep the rig, and they want to keep the folks together, and they get the skid system to go along with it.","Thomas Curran","Okay. And then turning \u2013 when it comes to the AC drive rig market \u2013 turning to the 28 smaller contractors that control about 18%, are you seeing any of those drillers bidding rigs at day rates, where they are clearly now operating at a loss? Have you seen any signs or heard anecdotes about any having gone out of business or potentially being on the verge of having to file?","John Lindsay","I haven\u2019t on either case. I think I\u2019ve heard some mid to \u2013 I guess mid-to-high teens type numbers that have been lower than what I\u2019ve talked about, but I haven\u2019t heard of anybody bidding AC rigs at cost breakeven or anything like that, and I\u2019m not aware of anyone that\u2019s particularly in trouble, in financial trouble.","Thomas Curran","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back.","John Lindsay","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walt Chancellor of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Walt Chancellor","Good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Walt Chancellor","John, I agree, the sign that you\u2019re seeing some churn, and some customers trading up is a positive sign. But I guess, the early termination revenue that you all announced incrementally, that seems like a pretty large number, and I was just hoping you could put that in context for us. Any details around timing or basins, things of that nature to help put that in context for us? And also, how that\u2019s sort of shaping your view on the market right now?","John Lindsay","Well, I was surprised, I think on the last call, we have 31...","Juan Pablo Tardio","Mid-March.","John Lindsay","Mid March, okay. So mid March, we had 31 early terminations, and I think I even commented on the last call that we were surprised with the ones that we had received. At the same time, as we began to kind of think about it a little bit, you contrast with the number of early terminations that we had in had 2008 and 2009, we had close to 40. At that time we had, like I said earlier, a working rig fleet of about 185. This time, we are closer to 300, and we are at 44.","So it doesn't feel like it's really out of balance. The early terminations in general have been less than a year left on the term contract. So on a percentage basis, it's \u2013 I don't think it's out of touch. I think it really just gets down to the bottom. At the end of the day, we have got customers that just have more rigs on term than they can handle with their budgets, and the lowest cost alternative for them is to early terminate the rig. ","And really, if you think about it, it's a fairly low cost option to get out from underneath that forward spend, and I think that's how a lot of the customers have looked at it. They have access to the best rigs, and then when they get into that situation, they just early terminate the rigs. So I don't \u2013 I am not overly concerned by it. I am surprised, however, that it has gotten to that level. As I start thinking about it, contrasting it, it's a lower percentage than what we saw. I think it's less than 15%, and back in 2009 and 2010, it was over 20% of our fleet.","Walt Chancellor","Great. That\u2019s a very helpful answer. I see we\u2019re up against the hour, so I\u2019ll turn it back. Thanks.","John Lindsay","Okay. Thanks a lot. We may have time for one more question. If there\u2019s anybody with a question.","Operator","Very good. Our final question will come from John Daniel of Simmons and Company.","John Daniel","Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me in.","John Lindsay","Good morning, John.","John Daniel","Good morning. Just a couple here. I know you don\u2019t typically give financial guidance beyond the current quarter, but I am going to try and see if I can get you to work with me on this one. As we try and dial in the contract expirations and the comments on lower spot pricing, I mean, it\u2019s reasonable that we are going to see cash margins decline in fiscal Q3 and Q4. But do you think the magnitude will near what we are seeing here in fiscal Q2, or do you think it accelerates?","Juan Pablo Tardio","John, this is Juan Pablo. I'd hate to speculate on that. What I can tell you is that, is we are very pleased that we have the strength in terms of backlog, and at rigs under term contract that we have, not only for this year, but for the coming years. That provides a very strong foundation, allows us to have a very strong liquidity, and a strong foundation for earnings as well.","As I mentioned during my comments, we will be accelerating some of those earnings and cash flows through these early terminations. But at the end of the day, it's hard to provide a clear path in terms of bottom line, excluding early terminations, because we just don't know how much or how many more of those we might receive in the future. Sorry, I can't answer the question, but those are some comments around it.","John Daniel","Okay. Well, I am going to try to \u2013 let me go this way. If you guys \u2013 I think you mentioned a contract backlog numbers. I didn\u2019t catch the exact numbers, but it sounded like they were lower, than where they were the last time you updated it. I guess, is any of the decline, if I heard that correctly, is any of that decline country related to term contracts perhaps being amended to work with the customers? And if so, just how broad based might that be?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Well, the backlog of decline from $4.6 billion at the end of last year at December 31 to $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2015, and there were several moving parts that impacted that. Of course, we had some rigs that continued to work as expected, and generate part of that related revenue during the quarter. That is one moving piece. Another piece are early contract terminations that, of course, speed up part of the backlog.","And then, there are some delays, in terms of rigs moving to the right, in terms of our completion and delivery of those rigs. There are some negotiations with customers, where we believe we have reached win-win type scenarios, where we might exchange day rates on particular rigs with other rigs, remaining whole in terms of our backlog, or extending contract durations, et cetera. Overall, we are very pleased with our ability to sustain the strength of the backlog as expected.","John Daniel","Okay. Fair enough. Let me throw a last one here. How would you characterize the pressure from customers today, versus January, February, in terms of a desire to come to you, and have you work with them on contract renegotiations? Has it subsided at all?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Well, John, obviously it's a much different market today and, of course, a lot of the issues were resolved back in January. Some were resolved in a win-win situation, and others were resolved in the way of an early termination. But there continues to be conversations, and we are going to stay close to our customers, and continue to work with them as best as we can, and again, try to seek win-win solutions. And I think we have been able to do that thus far.","John Daniel","Okay. I didn\u2019t know if perhaps the recent small rally in crude has helped alleviate any of the tension at all?

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this call may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dave Wilson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Wilson","Thank you, Tony, and welcome everyone to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.","With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Mark Smith, Vice President and CFO. Both John and Mark will be sharing some comments with us, after which, we'll open the call for questions.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'll remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws.

","During the call, we also make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You will find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations in yesterday's press release.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John Lindsay ","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I will address several topics today. First, I will talk about industry dynamics, our results and utilization. Next, I\u2019ll discuss how our leadership position in the U.S. unconventional basins with our flex rigs and software solutions is allowing us to gain more traction in international markets. And lastly, I\u2019ll discuss the momentum we\u2019re seeing with our customers, who are early adopters of our next generation technology. ","The industry saw further softening in U.S. drilling activity, resulting from crude oil price volatility and tightening drilling budgets. Notwithstanding these challenges, H&P produced solid operating results and maintained flex rig super spec utilization at close to 90% during the quarter. ","Our expectation of the company\u2019s rig count reaching the bottom during the quarter turned out to be premature. The effects of the industry emphasis on disciplined capital spending continues to reverberate throughout the oil field services sector. As such, H&P exited the quarter in the U.S. with 214 active rigs, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. ","Even with the lower than expected activity in U.S., H&P still performed well, generated $250 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. We see further softening during our fourth fiscal quarter as our guidance would indicate. And while we\u2019re hesitant to make another prediction, our sentiment now is that we should start to see some improvement around the time customers recalibrate during the final calendar quarter of the year and began to plan for activity in 2020. And looking at our last 30 rig releases, more than 80% were associated with a project completion or a budget related reduction. They were not related to pricing. We continue to win bids in the open market, however, there is a high level of churn in our rig count. ","The good news is that US land industry super specialization remains close to 90% and pricing remains firm for the best in class of the fleet. Even as activity trends lower, we continue to see persistent demand for top performing rigs that are required for more complex wells with longer laterals and tighter well spacing. Evidence of this can be seen by peeling back the activity statistics. ","Since January, we find that industry AC drive activity has declined approximately 8% to around 720 rigs and the legacy SCR and mechanical rigs that are drilling horizontal wells has decreased by approximately 24% to about 210 rigs. We believe this indicates that the highgrade cycle remains intact. As customer drilling plans grow in complexity, better rig technology that is capable of achieving higher performance and reliability remains in demand. ","Also supporting firmness and super spec pricing is a market concentration, where the top five US land drillers currently own approximately 80% of the active super spec fleet.","Our leadership position in the U.S. unconventional basins with flex rigs and software solutions is allowing us to gain more traction in international markets. We announced last quarter a contract to deliver our first Super spec flex rig from the U.S. into Argentina. And we expected to commence operations in our fourth fiscal quarter. ","In addition, we're pleased to announce that a letter of intent has been signed to send a second super spec flex rig from the U.S. to Argentina to drill in the Vaca Muerta basin. The company also saw an increase in activity in Bahrain and now has two rigs active. Transitioning to our H&P technology segment, we continue to make progress in rolling out auto slide an important step in H&P's drilling automation technology. ","This technology becomes more significant as shale plays institute more manufacturing type profit where automation can be employed to drive further efficiency gains and where wellbore quality and placement become essential factors for well construction. We're finding that operators desire automation because they want to be able to deliver a consistent and efficient directional drilling results from rig to rig which drives capital certainty. And auto slide is producing these results.","In addition to efficiencies the wells have less virtuosity, meaning higher quality, have a higher quality well bore and they're placed more accurately and the curves are also landed more accurately.","Auto slide has been deployed commercially and purposely thus far in four U.S. shale basins the Midland, the Eagle Ford, the Scoop Stack and the Bakken. The company anticipates introducing this technology to the Delaware basin later this fiscal year and eventually, in all of the basins where we work. ","Not even MagVar continue to grow their respective customer bases. However, both are experiencing the same headwinds of this industry environment in terms of rig count. We believe activity pauses here are temporary. And as these digital technologies provide higher levels of reliability, wellbore quality and placement we have the opportunity to be the industry standard.","The adoption of our FlexApp software continues to increase as customers see the value of these technologies deliver. And we are pleased to find that some are asking to use these solutions on non-H&P rigs. We are responding to this opportunity by migrating the FlexApps software to our H&P technologies business segment where these innovations can be marketed on both H&P and non-H&P rigs. ","We believe this market environment, where there is a mandate for capital discipline, and investment return is ideal for demonstrating the benefits of H&P innovative software, and the meaningful impact these offerings can have on economics over the lifespan of a well. There are industry studies documenting what we believe and what you heard me say previously. ","Even in this discussion, that wellbores with less tortuosity produce more oil, and cost less to maintain. While more accurately placed wellbores will provide more optimal drainage of a reservoir and produce fewer parent child well interference problems. The transformational shift for any industry takes time. And speed of adoption isn't as fast as we would like for some of these software offerings. ","The challenge is not so much the software development and implementation, but the changes these technologies create in the customary workflow at the rig site. The jobs at the rig are changing, and in some cases, the role is being eliminated at the rig side and relocated to an offside command center. That kind of disruption requires strong change management from all parties involved. We are making progress with a handful of customers and we believe we're on the right path. ","In closing, H&P remains well positioned with the largest fleet of super spec rigs and unmatched software solutions that provide improved wellbore quality and placement to deliver economic value. The oil field services industry is experiencing the effects of E&P company emphasis on discipline capital spending, and prioritization of cash flows with less focus on growth. While short-term, this may be painful for some this disciplined approach will lead to a healthier industry long-term. ","Our strategy provides the financial and operational flexibility to adapt to the market. We have the capabilities required to be successful. The people, FlexRig fleet, software solutions, a strong term contract coverage, and the balance sheet to navigate through the short-term market uncertainty and position us well for the future. Our strategy delivers superior value for customers and shareholders providing all parties the opportunity to achieve mutual long-term success in this changing industry climate. ","And now I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks, John. Today, I will review our fiscal third quarter 2019 operating results, provide guidance for the fourth quarter, update full fiscal year 2019 guidance as appropriate and comment on our financial position. ","Let's start with highlights for the recently completed third quarter. The company generated quarterly revenues $688 million versus $721 million in the previous quarter. The quarterly decrease in revenue is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of rigs working in the U.S. land segments as expected.","Total direct operating costs incurred were $445 million for the third quarter versus $443 million for the previous quarter. The increase is primarily is attributable to higher than expected self-insurance expenses in the U.S. land, despite the decrease in revenue days. Also contributing was a write down of certain inventories and materials and supplies which flowed through OpEx and was related to decommission and drilling equipment and spares which were on a separate line item in the income statement and which I will now describe in more detail.","During the third fiscal quarter a detailed assessment of our flex rig four asset group was performed. The end objective of this assessment was to maximize the utilization and enhance the margins of the domestic and international flex rig four asset groups. In June 2019, this assessment concluded that marketing a smaller fleet of these two asset groups will provide the most optimal economic outcome. As such we have downsized the number of domestic and international flex rig for drilling rigs marketed to customers from 71 rigs to 20 in the U.S. and from 10 rigs to 8 internationally. ","Major components from the decommissioned rigs were added to capitals spares for our rig fleet, following this downsizing process a detailed study was then performed to identify the appropriate quantities of capital spares and drilling support equipment required to support the future operating needs of our ongoing rig fleet. This resulted in the write down of excess capital spares and drilling support equipment, resulting in a non-cash impairment of $224.3 million, which is roughly 5% of ending net PP&E.","General and administrative expenses totaled $47 million for the third quarter. This is below the run rate for our previous full year guidance. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 17% due to certain discrete tax benefits and incremental foreign and state income taxes. The rate is below the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% as it is calculated on the pre-tax loss. ","Summarizing the overall results of this quarter, H&P incurred a loss of $1.42 per diluted share, versus earning $0.55 in the previous quarter. Third quarter earnings per share were negatively impacted by net $1.82 per share select items as highlighted in our press release and including the aforementioned impairment. ","Absent the select items adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.40 in the third quarter versus an adjusted $0.56 during the second fiscal quarter.","Capital expenditures for the third quarter fiscal 2019 were $74 million, year to date fiscal 2019 we have extended $404 million or about 80% of the low end of our full year CapEx guidance.","Turning to our four segments beginning with U.S. Land Segment, we exited the third fiscal quarter with 214 contracted rigs which was a decrease of approximately 5% and the number of active rigs quarter end to quarter end. H&P maintained over 20% U.S. Land market share from quarter-to-quarter. ","As John discussed, we expect to see some further reductions in active rigs in the fourth fiscal quarter. We expect our super-spec rig class to see an average utilization level in the mid 80 percentile range. Despite some softening market conditions during the third fiscal quarter pricing remained firm in the super-spec market space. Our average rig revenue per day excluding early termination revenue increased to $26,122 for the quarter slightly above our guidance.","Included here is the increasing customer adoption of our FlexApp offerings that are approximately $450 per day per rig revenues across the fleet, up from $300 last quarter. The average adjusted rig expense per day increased to $14,852. This is above our previously guided range primarily due to higher than expected self insurance expenses and the aforementioned inventory write-down.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for U.S. Land, we exited the quarter with 214 rigs working, but have continued to see rig releases in this volatile oil market. Most of our customers have spent over 50% of their budgets during the first half of the calendar year. And they are now assessing plans for the remainder of the year. ","We do expect the industry's rig count to eventually stabilize, once customer reach a run rate of spend that aligns with balancing their budgets. That said, we don't have an absolute visibility when that point will be reached. We are currently operating 207 rigs today in the U.S. with an expectation that we will exit the quarter with between 193 and 203 active rigs. This would result in a sequential decrease of approximately 5% to 6% in the quarterly number of revenue days, which translates to an average rig count of approximately 204 rigs during the fourth quarter.","Although, we have 45 FlexRigs that are upgradeable to super-spec our initial objective is to put these 34 idle super-spec rigs we currently have back to work as the market tightens and as opportunities to displace the legacy rigs continue to rise. Compared to the third quarter at 26,122 per day, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to be within a range from 25,250 to 25,750. This range now excludes FlexApp whose revenues and associated margins will be transitioning to the H&P technologies segments in the fourth quarter.","And our average day rate in both the spot and term market remain in the low to mid-20s range and the leading edge super-spec FlexRig pricing remains in the mid-20s. The normalized average rig expense per day directly related to rigs working in the U.S. Land segments remains approximately 13,700 per day. The average rig expense per day is expected to be in a range of 14,350 to 14,850 for the fourth quarter. ","Note that with a reduced number of upgrades upfront reactivation expenses have begun to come down. So this is being offset somewhat by the additional idling costs of recently released rigs. Decommissioning costs will also be incurred in the near-term for flexible rigs as previously discussed. We had an average of a 142 active rigs under term contracts during the third quarter. And today that number is 138 or about 67% of our 207 working rigs.","We expect to have an average of 138 rigs under term contract in the fiscal fourth quarter, earning the current average day rates. For the 88 rings that currently remain under term contracts through the end of fiscal 2020, the associated day rate is about $200 per day higher than today's average. ","Regarding our international land segments, the number of quarterly revenue days decreased 3% in the third fiscal quarter slightly below our guidance due to an early termination of a rig in Q3 that will return to work in Q4. The adjusted average margin per day in this segment decreased by $3957 to $7904 in the third fiscal quarter. The decrease was primarily due to start up and reactivation calls for the rigs in Argentina and Bahrain.","As we look towards the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for international, quarterly revenue days are expected to increase slightly with an average fourth quarter rig count of approximately 17 to 18 active rigs in the segment. Our first international super spec flex rig is scheduled to commence operations in Argentina midway through this fourth quarter. The average rig margin is expected to be relatively flat in between $7500 to $8500 per day during the fourth quarter due to startup costs for the Argentine rigs. Additionally, we will experience non-operational times due to longer rig moves within Argentina in Q4. ","Turning to our offshore operations segment, we continued with six active rigs during the third fiscal quarter and had a rig change from a standby rate to a working rate which positively impacted revenues in the quarter. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially due to the previously mentioned rate change being in effect for most of the quarter, as well as lower than expected self insurance expenses. ","As we look toward the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, for our offshore segment. We have six of eight offshore rigs contracted, the average rig margin per day is expected to be relatively flat in the range of $12,000 or $13,000 during the fourth quarter. ","Now looking at our H&P Technology segment. As John mentioned, we will be moving flex apps to H&P technologies in the fourth quarter. These apps were developed on top of our flex rig operating system initially for us on our flex rigs. Two of our six apps are used in the auto slide offering. Customers have expressed interest in using these apps on non-H&P rigs in much the same way that the motive big guidance system and Magvar are deployed via software as a service. ","We are just now commencing the process of determining how to make our software applications available on other rig operating systems. Combining all of our software solutions into HPT expands our service offerings to customers and focuses our research and development efforts on our technology roadmap as we continue to move toward automated drilling for the industry. ","Beginning with this quarter's guidance, we are issuing a revenue guidance range for the next quarter for HPT consistent with our forward guidance in the drilling segments. We are expecting Q4 revenue for HPT to be between $17 million to $19 million inclusive of flex apps. Remember that HPT is not only a new segment, but also a new business model. And even with the ongoing successes that John mentioned earlier, in our industry widespread customer adoption is hard to predict with certainty. ","Now, let me look forward on corporate items for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Our current revenue backlog for the U.S. land fleet for rigs under term contract which we define as rigs with contracts with original fixed terms of at least 6 months and they contain early termination provisions, there's approximately $1.4 billion. ","Capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2019 are expected to come in at the low-end of our guided range from 500 million to 530 million. We have one to two remaining upgrades of FlexRigs to super-spec capacity in the fourth fiscal quarter. We are starting to see reduced maintenance CapEx given our current rig activity levels. Finally, the completion of some of our long lead both purchase items will round down on our fourth quarter CapEx.","Given our September 30th fiscal year-end, we have begun our annual budgeting process. Maintenance CapEx will correlate closely with our operating rig counts. FlexRig capital maintenance typically ranges from between 750,000 to 1 million per active rig per year. Our international and offshore rigs incur approximately 1 million to 1.25 million per active rig and annual maintenance CapEx. ","This completed with today's rig count. Our budget would contemplate a total of approximately 230 rigs across all operating segments with a maintenance capital spend of roughly $230 million. Our first goal will be to redeploy idle super-spec rigs prior to conducting any upgrades. After adding in plan special projects and corporate expenditures, including information technology and infrastructure items. ","Our total CapEx for fiscal 2020 excluding any upgrades or international growth opportunities will be below $300 million, which is more than 40% less than this current fiscal year. Depreciation for fiscal 2019 is expected to reduce to a total of approximately 550 million plus an additional 15 million or so and abandonments and accelerated depreciation that have been primarily related to super-spec FlexRig upgrades. The revised combined total is about 565 million less than previous guidance due to the previously mentioned impairment. ","Our general and administrative expenses for the full fiscal 2019 year are now expected to come in just under our prior guidance of 200 million in total. Note this projection is less than our final 2018 G&A, when we ended the year with the U.S. planned rig count of a 190 rigs versus today 270 operating rigs. Versus today 207 operating rigs, sorry. We are now protecting our Q4 effective tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 32% in addition to the U.S. statutory rate that we incur incremental state and foreign income taxes.","And now looking at our financial position, Helmerich & Payne had cash and short-term investments of approximately $380 million at June 30th versus 270 million at March 31, 2019. We are in cash flow from operations of approximately 250 million in fiscal Q3. A portion of this increased cash flow was due to a working capital unlock related to both reduced activity and new initiatives to optimize working capital, as well as our discipline on capital expenditures. When adjusting for sequential quarter networking capital changes, our operating segments generated approximately $119 million in cash flow from operations in the third quarter.","After funding our Q3 CapEx of $74 million and paying our quarterly dividend of approximately 770, sorry, of approximately 77 million. We had roughly 40 million in cash accretion outside of networking capital changes. Our debt to capital at quarter end was about 11%. The continued best in class measurement amongst our peer group H&P has no debt maturing until 2025. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity level, and term contract backlogs provide H&P the flexibility to adapt to market conditions, take advantage of opportunities, and maintain our long practice of returning capital to shareholders through dividends. ","That concludes our prepared comments for the third fiscal quarter. Let me now turn the call over to Tony for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Brad Handler","Thanks very much, good morning. And thanks as always, for the detail. I guess, I can't help but queue in a little bit John on your, you sniffed out a little bit of optimism for 2020 I guess or 2020 preparation. So maybe we could ask you to expand on that. The obviously that would sort of buck, what might be considered a normal seasonal trend of operators kind of backing off because of budget exhaustion. But I imagine you're thinking there is a guide path the guide path that they've already set to be more conservative with it. But again, if you could expand on that, please that would be helpful. ","John Lindsay","Sure. Well, I think, obviously, the feedback that we get from our customers, and of course, we like everyone, we digest all of the sell side commentary and try to keep up as much as we can with budget, the budgeting process. And I think we would all agree that, budgets were set in this $50 to $55 price range for \u201819. And more of the budget was spent more than 50% of budgets were spent in the first half of the year. And so you combine that with kind of the discussions that we're having with customers. And again, it's, we're not in the business of predicting what rig counts are, but that's kind of what we're seeing is towards the end of this quarter going into the next quarter, we see it feels like it's starting to kind of flatten out. ","I think, again, depending on what the budgets are for 2020 what oil price scenario is used. But if you were to assume that it's a 50 to 55. Again, that more than likely is going to require an increase in rig activity, in order to do get to the number of wells that need to be, need to be drilled. ","So that's kind of our view. And we backing it up a little bit with some of the customer conversations that we have. Obviously, we can't go into a lot of great detail there. But that's kind of our basis for our assumption.","Brad Handler","Understood, understood, I guess I'll askyou to reach in even if it's, you can obviously swap away as you need to. But do you sense and this would obviously be akin to your customer strengths anyway. Do you sense that it continues to be IOC led, or at least very large E&P led in that respect, or is it even broader than that? ","John Lindsay","I don't think there's any doubt that there's some of the larger companies that have, have had budget capacity. But in terms of getting prepared, getting ready for 2020 calendar 2020. I think there's a wide range of customers that are looking at different opportunities. So I think it's more broad based than that. ","Brad Handler","That's encouraging obviously, if I may a shift and just maybe it's just an education thing. Mark, you talked about self insurance? I'm not exactly sure what to do with that, right? I mean, obviously, that's their choices that you make. And it just sounds like there were expenses incurred, that obviously, you don't generally have insurance for, but how volatile is that, should I be reading in that it just, there were incidents that needed to be addressed? And therefore, those are not considered to be sort of normal course of events? What do I do with that I guess?","Mark Smith","Brad, thanks for the question. We have a large amount of retention that we managed internally before going to the insurance markets. And so there is some volatility, because as you alluded to, whenever any sort of incident arises, sometimes it's unpredictable as to the amount. And in addition, they can have a long duration in terms of eventual settlement. So you may know this through all three operating segments from quarter-to-quarter, we occasionally have adjustments, up and down related to our retention levels.","Brad Handler","Fair enough, and so it's just, you obviously plan for that it was a little below your normal run rate expectations. Last quarter was obviously about it this quarter. ","Mark Smith","Again, it is hard to beyond a run rate we obviously work with an actuary to try to ascertain what that run rate should be, but actual events don't always unfold as planned.","Brad Handler","And then I'll turn it back was it very concentrated the higher expenses was it very concentrated in one or two or three rigs? Is that how we might think of it?","Mark Smith","No, it's really just with the scale that we have the number of rigs that we have operating in so many different regions of the country that, it can be lumpy.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sean Meakim","So John, first thing, how would you characterize the guy is that you gave for fiscal fourth quarter. So meaning, would you think that this is some of your fleet catching up with the rest of the lower 48 given your rigs have been fairly resilient. And the first half of the year you've taking share? As we've had more rigs come off, are you just kind of seeing a bit more of a catch up? Or what is the difference between the customer mix see if I can help us understand maybe how you're perceiving things differently than a few months ago?","John Lindsay","As you know, looking at our data, I don't think we've lost any share if we have it's a very, very small amount. And I don't forecast necessarily losing any share going forward. Again, all we really have to face other than the public data is our internal communication with customer with customers. And again, keep in mind when I talk about churn, we have rigs released and rig often times before it ever hits the grass, re-contracted. And then of course, there are rigs that are coming out of the grass that have been re-contracted. And so there's just this consistent if you will of risk being released and going back to work. And this is just again, we try to give a broad range. Obviously, we gave a broad range for Q3, and we hit the bottom or just under the bottom of that range. Again, we've got a range here, it's just, it's just a function of where we're, we'll hit, again, our hope would be is it will hit in the middle, or will hit higher, but still got a long way to go in the quarter. I know, it's not a direct answer, but I sure don't see us losing any ground in any way. I think the super spec fleet is, is very well positioned. We've got very good performance going on, our people are doing an excellent job. So, I don't have any concerns there. I've mentioned in my prepared remarks related to the legacy rig fleet. I mean, those are those are real numbers. There are still, I mean, let's face it, there are still over 200, legacy rigs, drilling horizontal wells, and in some cases, they're drilling some of the more complex stuff. That's really a mismatch, it's a disconnect. And, we are seeing customers that are utilizing those type of rigs that are saying that they see an opportunity to improve. ","At the same time, the smaller companies, with smaller rigs, maybe less capable rigs, are also doing everything they can to keep rigs running. So you know what that means? They're pushing the price envelope, but when you start talking value proposition, it's, the lower day rate just doesn't win the day.","Sean Meakim","Understood. And I appreciate that, that kind of leads to my other question. So far, you've elected to focus on value over volumes in this environment, right. And that's, that's been proven to be the right approach so far. But then as we get later in the year, and we see more rigs come off in the aggregate, and more of your peers are going to roll over decent sized portion of their contracts to, to new rates. At what point do you think that the market may force you to change how you approach that value over volume strategy?","John Lindsay","Well, a couple of things. One would be, I don't know which rig, specifically you're talking about that are, that are rolling have already addressed but the legacy piece of it. But the value proposition is if rigs are delivering value, they're going to be hard pressed to be replaced by something that is given a $3000 or $4000 or $5000 a day discount, because all you have to do is save a couple of days, on a 15 to 20 day well. And you've more than paid back the discount on the, on the prices of the rig. So the fact of the matter is of the rigs that we've had released, and again, I addressed this in the prepared remarks it may not be clear, but 30 rigs that are released over 80% of those at the end of the budget, there was no negotiation, we could say, hey, tell you what, we'll give you the rig for free and they wouldn't have been able to keep the rig running. ","And more than likely it was a rig that was a spot market rig regardless of if it was a top performer. If it's the end of this program, it's going, it's going down and there was no rig coming in replacing it at a lower rate. And so I suspect that we'll continue to see that but once you get to this level of rig count that probably a lot gets it to that kind of breakeven of spending, essentially 100% of your budget for 2019. Then our view and what we're hearing from customers is that they're going to maintain that rig count. They're not going to continue to release. So I hear what you're saying, the super spec utilization is still close to 90%. With the numbers that we're describing it, we would think it would be in the mid-80s, 85%, 86%. But again, the value proposition is what really wins the day. ","Operator","Next we'll move to Tommy Moll with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tommy Moll ","John, I wanted to start on auto slide. Good to hear the progress rolling it out and additional basins with plans for one more this quarter. You did highlight the disruptive aspect of the technology and how that can present an extension of the timeline for customer adoption? But to unpack that a little bit. Could you update us on how many rigs are now running auto slide and then going forward without putting trying to put numbers around it but just speaking generally. Is this a situation, like you see with a lot of technologies where somewhere down the road, we hit a tipping point. And enough customers have tried it and talked to one another and had good results that maybe there's a meaningful inflection higher?","John Lindsay","Yes. That's true. I think, I've mentioned it previously in that. We saw very similar type trend with flex rigs in the early days, it was tough letting early on. And once customers began to see the value, then there was a push. And so today, we're on five rigs in those four basins. We could be on more rigs today. But again, we're being very purposeful and the way that we're rolling this out. And our hope would be at least the plan right now would be to double that by the end of this fiscal, the fourth fiscal quarter.","As we continue to add a customer, and as we add additional rigs to current customers. So the rollout has been purposefully slow, because, again, we're doing something that's really never been done before. And a lot of what has to take place is proper change management, which means clear communications of the goals. And it's obviously very important that our customer has a clear vision of what they want to accomplish. And that's part of what I was addressing and again in my remarks. Where they want this reliability, they don't want to have a top 10%, 20%, 30% of their fleet, they want everybody to be performing on the drilling side in a similar fashion. And you can do that of course with automation. ","And so that's I think what's really the driver and this idea of having capital certainty. So as an example, you don't have 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% of your well that lie on the curve in the wrong part of the zone, right? And then you got those challenges that costs you money. So there's lots of advantages on that. There's risk, less risk as far as landing, and there's less risk as it relates to using the example of tripping. We've seen examples where we're tripping less, so you have less exposure to employees, because you're tripping less. You're just you're drilling ahead. ","So I agree. I think there, I think there will be a tipping point. It's kind of slow going right now. But we definitely have some very strong customer partnerships that are that are really working out very well right now. ","Tommy Moll","Thanks, John. That's all very helpful. And shifting. Shifting gears. Mark, I wanted to circle back to a comment you made about decommissioning cost that we should anticipate for the flex fours. Is that something that's going to show up at some point in the daily operating costs in the model? And if you are able to comment maybe on timing or magnitude, I think it would help set everyone's expectations just for the OpEx. Although, we know in advance that it's coming. ","Mark Smith","Yes. Thanks for the question, Tommy. As you go from as you go from our normalized per today, figure of around 13.7, to the average expense says yes, in there you would see, I don't know roughly $100 per day, at least in this next fiscal quarter. There could be some trailing cost in the first fiscal quarter of 2020, just depends on we're still finalizing plans related to the exact, this is just another component tree on the decommissioning rigs. And, that'll also factory on the how much bleed over we have from quarter to quarter, but it should be nonetheless, transitory costs, and it totally winds down around the beginning of the calendar year.","Tommy Moll","Right. Thank you. That's all for me.","Operator","Great, thank you. Next, we'll move to Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning, John. Mark, everybody. Thank you so much for the color commentary on what's going on the marketplace. Hey, John, just want to get a general sense, right. It sounds to me like the conversation you're having with the customer base. As indicated, is suggestive of, you have started to think about what you're going to need going into, going into 2020. The narrative also sounds very similar to what we've probably heard over the course of past 10 years in terms of the matter what the price point is on a less efficient rig. As you already mentioned, the value proposition for using, a super spec rig doesn't make sense in swapping. It seems like there's cost currents out there. So just want to really clarify, is the pricing pressure that you indicated? Is that solely coming at the lower end of the rig market? And secondarily, can you confirm that you haven't experienced any indications of some of your competitors starting to discount pricing on super spec rigs? ","John Lindsay","Well Kurt, as you know, you've been in this business for a long time. There's always a certain amount of pricing pressure that's going on but as well complexity as we have more complex wells, there's less of that, because they understand the value proposition. ","There's no doubt that on the lower end of the spectrum. There's a lot of, what we would call in the past hand-to-hand combat, fighting in the trenches. That's some tough pricing going on. But I think in general, the bigger players have, at least from our perspective, have held and have had some pretty strong pricing discipline. I mean, there's always exceptions everybody is going to have an exception here or there. Depending on whether a rig's performing or not performing or whatever, various situations. But I think in general, it's been a pretty disciplined market.","Kurt Hallead","Appreciate that, maybe as a follow-up to it. To me, that sounds like based on your commentary that we're headed for another kind of wave of early terminations, whether it be in U.S. or international markets. Can you comment on that?","John Lindsay","We sure haven't had any. I think any early termination payments we've received have been legacy type. And they've been very small. Again, I mentioned earlier, a lot of the rigs that we've had released were spot market rigs that, they were top performing rigs but they weren't on term, and the customer had to get down to certain rig count. So I don't expect that we're going to see any early terminations. Again, we're hoping that we're getting close to this rig count dropping out, and then hopefully getting prepared for '20. ","Kurt Hallead","Great, thanks. And maybe just one last one for Mark, gave very specific and detailed guidance by segment. One thing that was left out that kind of begs the question, which is, can you give us some general sense of what HP Tech gross margins could be, in that, with that $17 million and $18 million of revenue that you provided?","Mark Smith","I think, if you, Kurt, I was kind of break that into two buckets. If you look at the run rate, we've had the last couple of quarters of HPT. And the MOTIVE, MagVAR and new burgeoning auto slide products. You could extrapolate that portion of HPT, they continue to have the same margin. But if you add to that the FlexApp the migration into Q4, that's a very high margin software application. And so you're just going to need to blend those together. ","Operator","And next we'll move to Chris Voie with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Chris Voie ","Just a follow up in the last question a little bit. I see that the prior quarter was not restated. Can you give a figure of how much revenue or sorry margin per day came out of the quarter with switch reflects that into HPT?","Mark Smith","In the third quarter, it was still in U.S. Land. We said that was about $450 per day in revenue and that's pretty much full margin revenue. ","Chris Voie ","And then switching gears. Just curious I'd like your commentary on this but. It seems like higher efficiency is kicking in the Permian finally especially the Delaware to some extent. Do you view that as much of a factor in terms of the rig count trending bit lower than you previously expected?","John Lindsay","I don't really have a sense of the efficiency gain that you're that you're mentioning.","Chris Voie","It just seems like the cycle times are starting to move there compared to other basins, but.","John Lindsay","Well, I'm sure, I know the Delaware has some challenges as an example that you don't have an Midland Basin cycle times are faster. We like we always do we figure it out. And, and so I wouldn't be surprised to see the improvement. The other reason for improvement in that basin will be that I'm sure there's a much higher percentage of AC drive super spec rigs working in there today than there were a year ago. And that will make a difference as well. But, we over time as an industry, our customers working together with service providers, we figure out how to how to drill those more effectively. ","I think we have a lot more rigs working in the Delaware also. So that also helps to drive greater efficiencies. ","Chris Voie","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. I'll turn it back. ","John Lindsay","All right. Thank you ","Mark Smith","Chris thanks and congratulations on your new responsibilities. ","Chris Voie","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And thank you. Next, we'll move to Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Scott Gruber","Yes. Good morning. ","John Lindsay","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gruber","Mark, you highlighted the progress and overhead that you've made. But with rig count expectations for 2020 coming down here across the industry, are there additional overhead and support costs reduction opportunity that you're contemplating, is there an opportunity to get leaner and leverage technology more to reduce costs?","Mark Smith","Well, I think, as I alluded to in the prepared comments, I think we're pretty well scaled in one respect, towards total support back office processes for the company. We've been able to leverage a bit to reduce G&A this year, even though we have as I mentioned, more rigs working then at this time last year. Nevertheless, there are various parts of the company that certainly can see some scaling up or down related to rig counts, one. Two, I mentioned our new initiatives to optimize working capital. And essentially, we implemented a world class ERP system just the last couple of years ago. And we are working on numerous process improvements, to really optimize that ERP system and automate many of our back office processes. And those have real business implications such as the working capital unlock we experienced this quarter with some recent, focused initiative. ","And then I guess thirdly as it as it relates to our district offices and our country offices internationally. We have various expansion and contraction obviously in the direct support. Those offices related to the number of rigs working.So we're is something we're continuously tweaking as we move through time and react to the business. ","Scott Gruber","Got it and then just on the CapEx side. You highlighted potential maintenance, here in fiscal '20 it's 230 given your rig count expectations, and overall fiscal \u201820 CapEx, likely coming in below 300. Can you provide some more color on the potential gap in between the low 200s and the high 200s what your other initiative are contemplated? And how quickly could you flex down towards the lower end if your volume expectations are hit, but very pleased there's some pressure on cash flow. ","Mark Smith","Firstly, let me mention that the 230 rig count I quoted was the rig count literally as of today across all segments. So we think that a rig count hopefully will be higher, that's going to be part of it to begin with. Through the rest of this summer and complete our budgeting and return to you in November with our guidance for next year, we'll fill in some of those holes. But we always have issues, we're looking at related to various improvements and our rig capabilities. ","So we incur some special projects there and have historically year-over-year. And then also, as we continue to optimize and improve back office functions. We do encourage some IT spend and other corporate spend. And then we have legacy businesses, where we also have some CapEx spend such as our Tulsa real estate business, et cetera. So lots of potential variability, we're just at the beginning of the budgeting process. And we wanted to give some sort of indication related to that, in terms of rig count, because that maintenance CapEx is going to be the predominant part of fiscal 2020 CapEx, it will be directly correlated to that rig count.","Operator","And we'll next move to Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Marc Bianchi ","I wanted to switch over to international quickly to just get any update on the opportunity to deploy more super-spec rigs outside of the U.S. You have a couple that are going in Argentina now. Just wondering, if there's any new information to discuss on that front?","John Lindsay","Sure Marc. I think Argentina, obviously we've got a strong position there. And have been encouraged that we've had these opportunities. And I think there are still opportunities to do more. Don't have anything signed up obviously yet. But I do think there's some opportunities to grow in Argentina. We continue to hear seems like there's a lot of momentum with IOCs that are looking to grow their further production there. ","So I think overall, it seems pretty encouraging. As far as outside of Argentina, the Middle East obviously holds some great promise, I think for us in the future. It's just hard to see it. We don't have clear visibility into when that time it would be. We've generally kind of cast it by saying when we begin to see unconventional resource plays, more horizontal drilling and international markets, and obviously, that's a great place for us to take our technology and our capabilities. So outside of Argentina don't have any real clear sight into anything other. ","Marc Bianchi ","John thanks for that. And last one, just for Mark. On the tax rate guidance, you provided here for the fourth quarter seems perhaps a little bit high from what might be a normalized rate. Can you just give us some commentary and how you think about that for 2020, fiscal 2020 and beyond? ","Mark Smith","Yes, Marc, it's little high in Q4 again to the big loss in the difference that we incur in this quarter. So to get back to more of a normalized year-to-date rate. And then it should drift back down, again for fiscal \u201920 and be somewhere between 21% statutory rate and 30% just dependent on the state and foreign taxes and the jurisdictions and where we operate.","Marc Bianchi","Thanks very much appreciated. ","Mark Smith","Thank you. ","John Lindsay","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. John Lindsay, please go ahead, sir.","John Lindsay","Okay, Tony, thank you. And thank you everyone for participating on our third quarter earnings call. To reinforce we believe we're very well positioned we have the flexibility and have a solid strategy for this changing industry outlook. The value proposition of the super spec flex rig the value or digital technologies and automation capabilities. Obviously well bore quality, pricing reliability. And finally a strong track record of financial discipline strong dividend policy with the flexibility to respond to market opportunities. And then finally, I just want to thank all of our people for their focus on actively care for teamwork and working with our customers daily work and driving high levels of customer service.

With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO. John and Juan Pablo will be sharing some comments with us, after which we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","As usual and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Thank you, again, for joining us on the call. We\u2019re pleased to deliver better than expected quarterly operational results in the midst of this improving U.S. land market.","Our goal is to safely provide performance-driven drilling services. And as we think about the future, I think, it is helpful to step back and properly frame where the company is today. There are three main areas I\u2019d like to focus on this morning.","First, the success we\u2019ve had in reactivating idle FlexRigs; second, the leadership position we have in the Permian; and third, some reasons why H&P is in a good position to continue to build its market share.","Let\u2019s start with the reactivation of 32 FlexRigs since the trough of activity in May. Of those rigs, 28 are in the spot market and four on term contract. 15 were in Permian; five in the Oklahoma, Woodford; three each in the Bakken and Haynesville; and two each in the Eagle Ford, Powder River Basin and Niobrara.","From a FlexRig model perspective, 22 were FlexRig3s and 10 were FlexRig5s. There\u2019s a perception by some that the FlexRig3 isn\u2019t as competitive as other models of rigs in the market. Of course, our customers know differently the FlexRig3 continues to be the workhorse of the fleet and deliver great value for customers.","Of the 32 rigs, 75% were pad capable and have 7,500 psi mud pumps. These rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs and we\u2019ve also added 14 new customers since May and momentum has been building as a result of the performance our people are delivering.","Our goal is to respond quickly to customer requests, provide problem free startups, and deliver very safe, efficient and reliable performance. We\u2019re pleased to have delivered great results, particularly on the very first well drilled by each of the reactivated FlexRigs. Let me give you a few examples of this performance.","The rig mobilizations out of our facilities have averaged less than four days from the rig down in our facility to moving the rig to the first location rigging up and being ready to drill. Subsequent moves after the first well have averaged less than two days. As far as drilling times by comparing customer AFEs and offset well data, we\u2019ve been able to determine that most of the FlexRigs drill the very first well under the AFE, some have been 20% to 30% under AFE and there have been many that have been record wells.","In addition to efficient rig moves and delivering world-class drilling performance, the 32 rigs have actually averaged lower than 1% downtime, which is aligned with the rest of our working fleet. Our people on the rigs are to be commended for the high levels of service attitude performance and value created for our customers and shareholders.","Our workforce staffing effort has also been very successful in rehiring previous employees for our reactivated rigs. We\u2019ve had close to a 90% success rate, as we\u2019ve reached out to previous field employees, resulting in hundreds of quality employees returning to H&P. In fact, all of our rigs staffing needs have been provided by rehires up to this point.","Another benefit this creates is the opportunity to promote our people. As you can imagine, this is a big boost to the organizations morale. Another success related to our rig activation is our 24\/7 center of excellence for safety, learning, and performance. The center of excellence works hand-in-hand providing support services to our field operations, so they can deliver operational excellence to our customers.","They\u2019ve developed systems that utilized predictive analytics, which help us reduce nonproductive time, enhance reliability, and optimize operational performance. All of these systems working in Unison shortened the learning curve and allow sharing of best practices between rigs driving performance improvements in a shorter timeframe and across the fleet.","I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t also mention the cruise and their supervisors that have managed our idle fleet of FlexRigs and they\u2019ve turned the process around to reactivating rigs. They\u2019ve shown great teamwork and it worked very hard to preserve our idle FlexRig equipment stored in our facilities and also to utilize the consumables throughout the fleet. Thanks to each of you for this great effort.","Shifting to the Permian with all the headlines it isn\u2019t a surprise that we\u2019ve activated more FlexRigs there than in any other basin. It is equally important to stress the capabilities we have in our Permian operations. We invested heavily in our infrastructure in the Permian back in 2012 through 2014, and it is our largest facility today, and at the peak, we were working just shy of 90 rigs in West Texas and had expectations to work as many as 125 rigs prior to the downturn.","Today, we have 49 rigs contracted coming off a low of 37 rigs. We have 71 idle FlexRigs in the area and 51 of those are 1,500 horse power, and we expect to continue to have opportunities to grow our active fleet in the Permian.","In addition to having our FlexRigs offering, we also have additional services in our Permian operation, where we provide rig move trucks and casing running capability for our rigs. We\u2019ve operated our own rig move trucking fleet since 1994, and today, we\u2019re the only major drilling contractor that owns and operates a rig move trucking fleet. Our ability to control the rig move process offers substantial advantages in efficiency, safety, and reliability to our operations and customers.","Historically, we\u2019ve ranged between 30% to 40% of all rig moves in the U.S. with our trucking fleet and that\u2019s similar to our Permian activity today. For over 10 years, we\u2019ve offered casing running services in our U.S. land fleet. A light trucking using our casing running personnel and tools provide competitive advantages in safety and productivity for our people and customers. Of the 14 new customers since May, eight are working rigs in the Permian were saying that the Permian is leading the recovery and having this infrastructure in place certainly will be an advantage going forward.","The third area I want to focus on is H&P\u2019s market position to continue efforts to grow our market share in U.S. land. The market today recognizes the advantages of 1,500 horse power AC drive rigs, because those rigs are best designed for the complexity and longer laterals for horizontal shale wells and customer demand for high levels of performance and reliability.","From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower, drill strength torque, and greater capability from technology solutions that 1,500 horsepower AC rigs provide, and therefore, they are the rig of choice. We estimate that H&P has approximately 55% of the available 1,500 horse power AC rigs in U.S. land today. So we\u2019re positioned with more capacity than any of our competitors in the market.","We currently have 104, 1,500 horse power AC drive FlexRigs under contract and 220 idle and available to go to work in the U.S. We have 19% share of the U.S. land horizontal directional drilling market with our closest competitor at a 11%. We have slightly grown our market share from 18% since the peak of activity in 2014. We are very hopeful that the market provides an opportunity to utilize our spare capacity and build on the lead we have.","Another example of H&P\u2019s industry-leading position as our currently of AC drive FlexRigs that have 7,500 psi circulating systems and multi-well pad drilling capability.","As mentioned earlier, these rigs meet the general criteria of what some industry followers have identified as super-spec rigs, which is a subset of AC drive rigs with 1,500 horsepower drawworks ratings.","We have approximately 80 of these rigs in our U.S. land fleet, and if demand remains high, we could upgrade additional FlexRigs and have approximately 120 of these rigs by the end of our 2017 second fiscal quarter.","The industry\u2019s capacity to provide additional super-spec rigs appears to be limited today, which positions H&P very well for future expansion in this space. Should there be a significant market demand for super-spec rigs going forwrad, H&P has a capability of providing approximately 270 super-spec FlexRigs to the market without requiring new build rigs, solely through upgrades where needed to our current FlexRig3 and FlexRig5 fleet.","Unlike many of our competitors, we don\u2019t need to build new rigs today. Our design allows H&P to invest in our existing fleet to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. We can do this in a scalable and cost effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs. Our spare capacity combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest in the fleet providing a family of solutions to meet customer needs and provide value to shareholders.","So before turning the call to Juan Pablo, it is clear the upcoming OPEC meeting is weighing on the oil markets. And yet even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it\u2019s still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market, as we\u2019re continuing to reactivate idle rigs out of our facilities safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $73 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, resulting in an annual net loss of approximately $57 million during fiscal 2016.","Nevertheless, operational results were better than expected during the fourth quarter and market improvement signs are encouraging. We are now expecting our second consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvement in overall activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2017","Following are some details on each of our three drilling segments. Our U.S. Land Drilling segment reported an operating loss of approximately $70 million during the fourth fiscal quarter. Nevertheless, the number of revenue days increased by approximately 6% compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 86 rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 67 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 19 rigs worked in the spot market.","Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $24,404 in the fourth fiscal quarter, as a proportion of rigs working in the spot market increase significantly quarter-to-quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,326, excluding the loss of settlements and adjustments to self-insurance reserves. The corresponding average rig margin per day during the fourth fiscal quarter was $11,078.","The segment generated approximately $30 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter. No early termination notices have been received or announced since our last call in July. But given prior notifications, we expect to generate approximately $9 million during the fiscal \u2013 during the first fiscal quarter and a total of over $30 million during several quarters there after in early termination revenues.","Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are estimated at approximately $466 million.","As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. Land segment include approximately 105 rigs generating revenue and 243 idle rigs. Included in the 105 rigs generating revenue, are 72 rigs under term contracts, 69 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 33 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 102 rigs generating revenue days in this segment, as compared to 86 rigs during our last earnings call in late July.","Approximately 4% of the 102 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates. which protect daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the three rigs that are not generating revenue days include new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.","Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in activity of roughly 20% in terms of revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $23,500, primarily as a result of the higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market.","Although, we have experienced spot pricing stabilization and are now beginning to see some spot pricing improvement, the average pricing today for the 33 rigs in the spot market is still over 35% lower as compared to our spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.","The average rig expense for day level is expected to increase to roughly $14,200. This expected increase is primarily attributable to a significantly lower proportion of rigs generating revenue days, while on standby, down from almost 13% of revenue days in the prior quarter to an expected level of under 5% in the first fiscal quarter.","Although, we expect this average expense level to eventually come down to more normalized levels during a recovery, the transitional or rig startup expenses, along with the carrying cost of over 200 idle and available AC drive FlexRig are temporarily and favorably impacting the average.","If we isolate rigs that are currently active, their average expense level is at approximately $13,000 per rig per day, which is similar to overall levels experienced in more stable time periods like 2013 and 2014. Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the aforementioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, this segment currently have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 69 rigs during the first fiscal quarter, 68 rigs during the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2017, 39 rigs during fiscal 2018, and 17 rigs during fiscal 2019.","These commitments include about 10 rigs that have relatively recently been placed under term contracts with pricing at slightly higher than current spot market levels. Thus, as we include this newly contracted rigs, the average daily margin for rigs that are currently under term contracts is now expected to decline moving from the prior $15,000 to $16,000 range to a new range between $14,000 and $15,000 per day during the next few quarters.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly increased to approximately $3 million. Total revenue days slightly increased and the average rig margin per day increased by about 14% during the fourth fiscal quarter to $9,070 per day excluding employee severance expenses in the prior quarter and self-insurance reserve adjustments during the quarter. Most of the rigs and generated revenue during the fourth fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and were generating standby-type day rates.","As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect quarterly revenue days to remain flat at seven of our nine offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $11,250 per day during the first fiscal quarter. The expected increase is primarily attributable to two of five rigs that were previously on standby-type day rates returning to work at operating day rates\/","Management contracts on platform rigs continue to contribute to our Offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter, however, was lower than expected at under $2 million. Nevertheless, management contracts are expected to once again generate around $3 million in operating income during each of the next few quarters.","Moving on to our international land operations, this segment reported operating losses of approximately $200,000 during the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of employee severance expenses during the prior quarter, the average rig margin per day increased sequentially by approximately 12% to $10,619 per day. The increase was primarily attributable to favorable retroactive pricing adjustments and to the absence of an expected temporary rate reduction that was mentioned during our late July call.","Quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by approximately 8% to 1,372 days at two rigs commenced operations during the quarter. As of today, our International Land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 11 in Argentina, two in Colombia, and one in Bahrain. 12 of these rigs are under long-term contracts.","We expect approximately $5 million in compensation related to early terminations for two rigs in this segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decrease by approximately 5% during that quarter, as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to approximately $8,000 per day as a result of several factors, including the expected absent of the early terminated rigs that were generating higher than average rig margins and more of the rigs under term contracts now at standby-type day rates.","When we combine all three of our drilling segments and exclude rigs with long-term contracts that have been early terminated, we currently have an average of approximately 82 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017, 51 in fiscal 2018, and 27 in fiscal 2019.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong Our backlog also remained strong at $1.8 billion as of September 30. Fiscal 2017 CapEx is estimated to be around $200 million, about 30% of which is expected to be related to maintenance CapEx and tubulars and the remainder mostly to upgrade of our existing fleet.","We continue to be in great position to sustain regular dividend levels and with great flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. After this extremely challenging time for everyone in the business, we are now the only investment grade rated company in our sector and one on a very short list within the entire oilfield services universe.","Total depreciation for fiscal 2017 is expected to decline to approximately $525 million and general and administrative expenses to approximately $140 million. The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to relatively low-levels of capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 and 2017.","The effective income tax rate on the loss for fiscal 2016 was approximately 27%, significantly different than expected, given that instead of a slight gain for the fiscal year, we experienced a significant loss as a result of the expected \u2013 of the unexpected select items that impacted the fourth fiscal quarter. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 at this point expected to be around 36%.","As of September 30, other current assets in our condensed balance sheet include a prepaid tax balance of $26 million and a tax receivable balance of $38 million. Also included in current assets are approximately $50 million related to insurance receivables, which are more than offset by approximately $72 million included in current liabilities in our condensed balance sheet related to the mentioned lawsuit settlement.","We have a portfolio of equity security consisting of Atwood Oceanics Inc. and Schlumberger Limited that is reported under investments in our balance sheet. And we have been monetizing these holdings over the years and recording very significant gains from the corresponding sales. Nevertheless, our 4 million share position in Atwood was determined to be an other than temporary loss during the fourth quarter as a result of the length of time that its share price had been under our corresponding cost.","As a result, we recognized a $26 million impairment charge equivalent to an after-tax loss of approximately $0.15 per share. This compares to an after-tax gain of approximately $0.86 per share recorded in 2013 when we monetize 4 million shares of our Atwood Holdings and reduced that position in half.","As we have in the past, we will probably hold our existing portfolio positions through this downturn and once again start to monetize them during more attractive times through the cycle.","Our non-current deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2016 was slightly over $1.3 billion, which is slightly higher than the prior year-end level. We expect this liability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.","With that, let me turn the call back to John.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo. Prior to open the call for questions, I want to reiterate a few points. We strongly believe H&P is the best fleet, especially for the more technically challenging horizontal shale wells. And equally, if not more important, we also have the people, the systems, and the operational support structures to drive the highest levels of performance and reliability for our customers.","We\u2019ve accumulated more than 1,800 rig years of AC drive operational experience. Our expertise designing, building and now upgrading the fleet provides great optimality for the customer and has resulted in H&P having the largest and most capable fleet of AC drive rigs in the industry. We remain committed to further expand our competitive advantages through technology and the scale of our operations in order to continue to add value to our customers and shareholders.","And Tony, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Lamotte","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Michael Lamotte","John, what is the \u2013 roughly the cost of upgrading a 1,500 to a super-spec? And what are you looking at in terms of components to accomplish that?","John Lindsay","If we were to use a base Flex3 that didn\u2019t already have a pad system then it would be to add 7,500 and the pad system would be approximately $2 million.","Michael Lamotte","Okay.","John Lindsay","If we already had the \u2013 which there are Flex3s that are idle that have the pad application to skid system that are idle. So there are several that we will just upgrade with just the 7,500.","Michael Lamotte","Okay.","John Lindsay","And then there\u2019s also some \u2013 in some cases, we\u2019re upgrading the setback capacity, that\u2019s a relatively small\u2026","Michael Lamotte","Small...","John Lindsay","\u2026investment, I want to say, it\u2019s around $200,000 or so. There\u2019s some folks that include in a super-spec the third pump and the fourth engine, the way we\u2019ve approached it, Michael is, it\u2019s really on a needs basis. If the customer has a true need for the third pump or the fourth engine, if the hydraulics requirements are there then that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. But it really depends on basin and it really dependent on customer-to-customer, whether you need two or whether you need three, and that\u2019s a relatively small incremental investment. Obviously, we already owned the pumps and the engines, it\u2019s just really the installation cost, the rigs are set up and designed to accept the additional equipment.","Michael Lamotte","Okay. And then about how much time, if you\u2019re doing the full $2 million, how much do you need to get all that work done?","John Lindsay","Well, a lot if it, as you can imagine, it\u2019s kind of like asking us a question, how long does it take to build a FlexRig, because a lot of the work has been done offline. If you\u2019re doing the work on a rig \u2013 on a \u2013 drilling a rig move, which happens occasionally, you\u2019re talking about a couple of extra days.","If it\u2019s being done on a rig that is \u2013 that has been idle, again, it doesn\u2019t take very long. A lot of the manufacturing, the fabrication is being done offline in our facilities similar to the or in the facilities that we\u2019ve used to build rigs in the past. So, as you can imagine, it\u2019s being done offline. The fleet profile is uniform. So it\u2019s kind of a lean manufacturing effort, if you will.","Michael Lamotte","Right. That\u2019s helpful.","John Lindsay","So it\u2019s kind of hard to say, how long it takes for a rig that\u2019s idle, it really doesn\u2019t make any difference, because it\u2019s being done offline. During a rig move, I want to say, it\u2019s two to four days. I don\u2019t remember exact, but I think that\u2019s right.","Michael Lamotte","Okay. So the important thing is, it\u2019s not a month.","John Lindsay","Right.","Michael Lamotte","It really is pretty quick. And then last one for me, on those super-specs, just in terms of the increase that you\u2019re getting, as you sort of look forward into the demand, is it a third of the incremental inquiry half? What\u2019s roughly the mix in terms of what customers are coming to you for these today?","John Lindsay","That is a great question, and I wish I would have thought about that and had the answer for you. I think about looking a lot of our market lines, surprisingly enough we still have, I\u2019d say surprising, because there\u2019s so much focus on super-spec. We still have customers that are still their requirement, their needs basis is a FlexRig3, some are single well, some are pad, with two pumps and 5,000 psi. If I were to guess, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s anywhere from 0.5% to 75%, it\u2019s kind of what I would estimate today.","Michael Lamotte","Okay.","John Lindsay","We made a note in our comments that for the rigs \u2013 the 32 rigs that we reactivated, 75% of those were super-spec.","Michael Lamotte","Okay.","John Lindsay","With the pad and 7,500 psi. And again, to be clear, some of those 7,500 had two pumps and some had three. And again, it\u2019s based upon what the customers needs are.","Michael Lamotte","Okay. That\u2019s a great color. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll turn back.","John Lindsay","All right, Michael. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning.","John Lindsay","Hey, Kurt.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead","So, John, I know there\u2019s a lot of different semantics flying around the marketplace in terms of super-spec and obviously, one of your larger competitors over the last couple of weeks had an Analyst Day and talked about some additional technology that they were adding to the mix. But focusing on the super-spec, as you referenced it and focusing on the term pad optimal, is that had optimal include walking systems, or is that just your current skid system?","John Lindsay","Yes, the pad optimal or pad capability whatever you call it, it\u2019s still, as we\u2019ve described our skid systems for Flex3s and Flex5s, of course, Flex4s were designed with skid capability, pad capability as well. So that is the design, and I mean, you know, because we\u2019ve talked about it several times.","I think quite frankly, we\u2019ve been talking about it for a couple of years now that when we have the demand from the customer in a meaningful way then that\u2019s something that we will do. We can do. We\u2019ve had \u2013 we have designs for it. And so I\u2019m sure eventually we will do that. But at this stage of the game, what we\u2019ve described in our fleet are Flex3s and Flex5s in the traditional pad configuration.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. And then, I guess, we would \u2013 we takeaway from your commentary today that again the vast majority of the customer base is not asking for omni-directional walking rig capability?","John Lindsay","Well, we do have \u2013 when you say omni-directional, we do have omni-directional capability with Flex4s and Flex5s. And but typically that isn\u2019t the need. And so and the Flex5, I\u2019m sorry, the Flex3, of you go back long enough, the initial pads were relatively small, they were 50 to 75 feet. And we have Flex3s today that are actually on 200 foot skid applications that were great.","So the omni-directional portion of the demand, we\u2019ve been able to meet with Flex5s or Flex4s where we\u2019ve needed it and it really hasn\u2019t impacted our customers designs as far as using the FlexRig3.","Kurt Hallead","All right, great. And then maybe just one more follow-up on the incremental demand. You mentioned additional rigs in the number of different basins clearly, the vast majority being in the Permian. With \u2013 what have you been taking up recently in discussion with E&P customers with respect to increased activity in Eagle Ford or the Bakken, obviously, you mention the Haynesville, so that kind of captured my attention as well. So outside of the Permian, what are you hearing?","John Lindsay","I think my sense would be, it seems like Eagle Ford compared to the last several months, there have been more inquiries in the Eagle Ford than what we\u2019ve seen, which is obviously great news for us, if we can see some material increases, because that\u2019s our \u2013 that was our second largest operational area back at the peak. We have great rigs and people and we\u2019re set up very well there.","As I think about it, David, I don\u2019t know, if you\u2019re \u2013 my sense would be, we continue to have a demand kind of across the board like it has been. I look back on this quarter and in the previous quarter and the Permian continued to be just under half and then the other ones are pretty equally distributed.","Kurt Hallead","I think, that\u2019s fair, John.","John Lindsay","Yes. There\u2019s just nothing that that jumps off the pages, says, oh, yes, this is the area maybe with the exception of the Eagle Ford, we have had some, at least, it seems like some additional discussions.","Kurt Hallead","Right. I appreciate the color as always. Thank you.","John Lindsay","All right, Kurt. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Lamotte","I didn\u2019t expect to get pulled in so quickly. Again, thanks, guys. John\u2026","John Lindsay","How did you do that, Michael?","Michael Lamotte","I don\u2019t know. Can you maybe provide some context on the term of the terms, are they rate escalators, or are there options on time? I imagine that the \u2013 are they wells six months what\u2019s kind of the context there?","John Lindsay","The average of the term contracts is a little over a year.","Michael Lamotte","Sorry, the new ones, that\u2019s of the new signed?","John Lindsay","Of the \u2013 yes, that\u2019s what I thought you were addressing, I\u2019m sorry.","Michael Lamotte","Yes, yes.","John Lindsay","Was that your question?","Michael Lamotte","Yes, sorry on the new ones, I think, I remember you saying that there were four ads of the \u2013 since trough that went out on term?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, Michael, and this is Juan Pablo. We also mentioned that in general of the new term contracts that we\u2019ve signed including some rigs that were rolling off of new build type term contracts and then went into shorter-term contracts but at much lower day rates, meaning, at spot-level day rates or slightly higher. We had approximately 10 of those. And the average, as John said, was a little over a year on all of those.","Michael Lamotte","Okay. And is there any \u2013 are there any common elements to those contracts or are they all very customer specific? What I\u2019m getting at is, I guess, what kind of visibility do you have fixed versus option on these? And what are \u2013 where the rate escalators what actually gets you more rate, as we move out in time on those contracts?","John Lindsay","Well, Michael, on the term contracts, it\u2019s a true term contract, where it\u2019s for a year, they\u2019ve got \u2013 it\u2019s a fixed rate. It had cost escalators. If we had some sort of an increase, a wage increase or something, and we have cost escalation provisions. But in general, it\u2019s a fixed rate or maybe the way to think about as a fixed margin for us. Again, you\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about it over the last several months. We\u2019re not going to be entering into very many of those. Obviously, we haven\u2019t in this particular case. Most of what we\u2019re going to be doing is just what you\u2019ve seen, which is spot market contracts and spot market pricing.","Michael Lamotte","Okay. And then on the field labor where are we today relative to peak in 2014 in terms of wages?","John Lindsay","We\u2019re at the same level \u2013 our wages are at the same level a day, as they were in 2014.","Michael Lamotte","Okay. And is there any pressure on those as you are out rehiring folks?","John Lindsay","I don\u2019t get a sense that there\u2019s pressure. I think one of the things to consider is that, I mentioned it in my comments, workforce staffing is doing a great job and we\u2019re having great success in hiring former employees back that were laid off during the downturn and they\u2019re coming back to work. And so what that\u2019s creating is, they\u2019re coming into the entry-level positions and now it\u2019s a great opportunity to move a floorhand back into drillers position, a driller back into a rig manager position, we\u2019re even promoting a few superintendents up into position.","So there are increases that are going on in the organization, but it\u2019s a function of being promoted to a higher level position. I would be surprised that that there would be wage pressure, at least, for the foreseeable future, and it\u2019s kind of hard to get arms around. We haven\u2019t predicted what the rig or the rig count is going. But I don\u2019t see that on the horizon right now.","Michael Lamotte","Okay. Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll turn back again.","John Lindsay","All right. Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to Robin Shoemaker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robin Shoemaker","Yes, thanks. So, John, wanted to ask about the \u2013 on the super-spec rigs, what is the sort of pipe-racking capacity that goes with that kind of asset?","John Lindsay","Well, we have \u2013 again, it comes back to definitionally, we have the standard FlexRig3, which was 22,000 to 23,000 feet. We\u2019re upgrading it to 25,000 to 26,000 foot range. But we\u2019re only doing that upgrade and if you\u2019re drilling 18,000, 20,000 foot wells, obviously, by definition, you don\u2019t need that additional setback capacity.","Flex5 came out standard with a 25,000 or 26,000 foot setback capacity, I believe, I\u2019ve got that right. So it\u2019s really, Robin, in response to what the customers needs are, we have that capability of with a pretty low cost investment of extending that setback capacity to 25,000 to 26, 000 feet.","Robin Shoemaker","Okay, thanks. I had another question on an unrelated. We\u2019ve been hearing from other drilling contractors and service companies about quite a bit of tendering activity for land rigs in the Middle East, multiple countries. And wonder if you could comment on that and your level of interest in those tenders. Are they the type of rigs, are they for FlexRigs? Are they the type of rig tenders for, which your rigs are suited?","John Lindsay","Yes, there has been some tenders, I don\u2019t remember all the details. We have bid Flex3s in \u2013 on international projects. I think, we\u2019ve also possibly even bid on some 3,000 horsepower work, which obviously, we have 3,000 horsepower SCR rigs as well. So we have participated, or at least, on the front-end of participating as far as I know we haven\u2019t heard anything back, I think, it\u2019s still in the early stages at this stage.","Robin Shoemaker","Okay. And finally, on the \u2013 you mentioned at one point that in the U.S. spot \u2013 average spot rates have come up a little bit from the lowest point. And I wonder if you could characterize \u2013 should we characterize that as a couple of thousand dollars a day, or is there some way you can frame that for us?","John Lindsay","Well, they have begun to come up, I think, it\u2019s \u2013 if you go back to our call in July and even some of the conferences that we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about, there would be a lot of competition coming off the bottom, kind of looking back in hindsight, you could say that May was the trough, and I think our lowest pricing was in August, and so we\u2019re starting to see some improvements.","I think to generally categorize $1,000 to $2,000 a day is a fine categorization again depending on the area, depending on the customer, depending on lot of things, but that\u2019s about all the clarity that I think we\u2019re willing to talk about at the stage. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that for high-quality rigs and high-quality performance, our expectation is that, they\u2019ll start to become some pricing power in the market.","Robin Shoemaker","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot, John.","John Lindsay","Thanks, Robin.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to Marc Bianchi with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Marc Bianchi","Thank you. Maybe following up on that last line of discussion on kind of pricing. Can you talk to where some of these super-spec rigs kind of the \u2013 maybe how much of a margin premium, or are you seeing a margin premium for those rigs?","John Lindsay","Marc, there are some today, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 and I say today recently I don\u2019t know over the last several weeks. There has been some additional pricing capability because of the needs and particularly focused on the higher spec rigs, the super-spec type applications. So we are starting to see that for contracts that we\u2019ve been bidding and that we\u2019ve been awarded for the most part.","Marc Bianchi","Okay, that\u2019s great. But fair to say there is sort of upward pricing momentum across the spectrum of your offering?","John Lindsay","I think so. That\u2019s why we spent the time we did talking about the performance that we\u2019ve seen. I think, again, customers are willing to pay for performance. Obviously, we\u2019ve been in a one heck of a downturn and so to be able to be in a position to hopefully be able to get return on the investments that we\u2019re making with these upgrades. So yes, that would be our expectation. But again, we expect it to be pretty slow.","Marc Bianchi","Sure, okay. Maybe just one more on the CapEx that you\u2019re talking about for 2017, I think, Juan Pablo, you said about 30% of that is directed towards maintenance, leaving $140 million for other stuff. I\u2019m assuming most of that\u2019s upgrade. That would imply perhaps you are upgrading more than the 40 rigs that you talked about to get from where you are now to the 120 at the end of next quarter. So just kind of curious, if that\u2019s right or maybe what some of those other buckets might be?","Juan Pablo","Yes, I think that is fair. Of course, we\u2019ve already spent some money in fiscal 2017 getting to the 80 that we mentioned. But it is fair to assume that we will continue to upgrade a fleet and some rigs require or we are planning for greater investment than $1 million might suggest. As John said, investments might require $2 million or more million dollars per rig.","And so it\u2019s a combination of making sure that we are ahead of the game, but we have great flexibility. We don\u2019t have to upgrade all 270 rigs that are capable of becoming super-specs. But we are very well prepared to be ahead of the market and trying to make sure that the timing does not represent a bottleneck for us as we continue through, or I should say, as we hopefully continue through this recovery.","Marc Bianchi","Okay, thanks. Maybe just, if I could, one more modeling. Is there an OpEx number we should be thinking about for standby rigs? Usually, we just sort of think about the pure margin there. But is there any OpEx associated with that that would maybe be showing up in the cost number? That\u2019s all I have, I\u2019ll turn it back after that.","John Lindsay","Thank you. Yes, very low, very, very, very low. We\u2019re talking about probably less than 10% \u2013 less than 5% of what a typical operating rig would be running at. We mentioned, we only have a handful of rigs on standby at this point that are generating revenue days and we\u2019re protecting the margin on those, but it\u2019s very, very low.","Marc Bianchi","Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you.","John Lindsay","Thanks, Marc.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to Robert MacKenzie with. Iberia Capital. Please go ahead.","Robert MacKenzie","Thanks, guys. I had a \u2013 I wanted to shift gears, I guess, maybe you said it, but maybe I didn\u2019t catch it, offshore. I know you talked a lot about land, but offshore you\u2019re guiding revenue days to be unchanged in the first fiscal quarter, but rig margin to expand quite substantially. Can you give us some color as to why that should occur?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Sure. So this is Juan Pablo. It\u2019s been interesting to watch that segment about a handful of rigs the seven that were active and on customer platforms were receiving day rates on standby-type condition. So in essence, they were inactive by generating revenue. We\u2019ve seen a couple of those rigs go back to work at operating day rates, which create, of course, margins that are higher than would be generated under standby-type conditions, and that\u2019s creating a favorable impact that is and that\u2019s why we are increasing, excuse me, that\u2019s why we\u2019re expecting an increase in the margins there.","Robert MacKenzie","So in terms of what you call revenue days then, if you\u2019re receiving a standby rate even though it\u2019s not working, you\u2019re considering that a revenue day?","Juan Pablo","Yes.","Robert MacKenzie","Okay. Good. And then coming back to some of Michael\u2019s questions early on about the term of new contracts, it sounds like you\u2019ve said you are getting some term contracts of over a year now. But I didn\u2019t hear your answer on how you are protecting yourself and preparing for either cost inflation or rates rising in the future. How do you think about structuring term contracts of over a year now to not give away too much upside?","John Lindsay","So, Robert, this is John. We only entered into four and there was some, I\u2019d say, it was a total of 10, okay, so you\u2019re going. So there\u2019s some particulars tied to why we entered into those. What we\u2019ve been saying all along is that, don\u2019t expect us to enter into a longer-term contracts at \u2013 in this kind of a pricing environment. The protection we have if price \u2013 if expenses go up then we have protection the contract to cover that, so our margin is held firm.","But the majority of the contracts that we\u2019ll be entering into and have entered into are going to be spot market base pricing. And so, our protection is in an improving environment is, it\u2019s typically a well to well agreement, and we would increase pricing in the next logical well assuming we see that kind of pricing increase. Does that answer your question?","Robert MacKenzie","Yes, it very much does. And I guess, the question that also follows is, are those term contracts of one year or more, is there any kind of differentiation between kind of the standard Flex3 or 5 versus a super-spec rig, or is it across the board?","John Lindsay","Some of those would have been standard rigs and some rigs would have had some upgrades and may have already had existing upgrades. I don\u2019t know for sure, whether I know, we didn\u2019t have the investment in all 10 of those. But some would be standard, some would be super-spec, and some of what we would have made the upgrade.","Juan Pablo Tardio","And, Rob, were you also asking about the pricing on those?","Robert MacKenzie","I think you guys already answered the pricing question.","John Lindsay","Correct.","Robert MacKenzie","So, yes, I was asking more about just the mix. So, and then on the super-spec, just the whole capacity, I mean, given your capacity and what we\u2019ve heard from others, does it sound like the established players have more than enough capacity to meet client demand in a fairly modest growth scenario?","John Lindsay","My impression is, it\u2019s pretty tight. I mean, based on what I\u2019ve seen from the other contractors and again, Juan Pablo made the point, we\u2019ve talk about what we could do. But we\u2019re the only one that has a real upside and how we can respond without having to build a new rig or without having to have some pretty major investments. Our other peers have a fairly limited number of AC drive 1,500 horsepower rigs to source. And so my feeling is that, it\u2019s a pretty tight market. So I guess, that\u2019s my perception.","Robert MacKenzie","So that given that then coming back to the pricing question, and as a method here, do you expect to see the premium for these types of rigs continue to or expand or continue to expand over non-super-spec rigs?","John Lindsay","Well, I think that\u2019s logical. I mean, the reality of the rigs are working really hard. They\u2019re drilling really good wells for customers that the rate on the rig doesn\u2019t really move the cost needle on the curve. So I think there is an opportunity to increase pricing, again, we\u2019re starting at a very low level. But anything, I think, at this stage of the game, we would all be pleased to just get some additional $1,000, $2000 a day here and there.","So, yes, I think there\u2019s some opportunity. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the rig \u2013 the super-spec rig should command a premium over rigs that don\u2019t have those additional investments, or don\u2019t have the capability, or don\u2019t perform well. I think that\u2019s the other point to make is just, because you have the rig that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re going to necessarily be able to deliver the performance and the value that customer requires.","Robert MacKenzie","Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it back.","John Lindsay","All right, Robert. Thank you.","David Hardie","We probably have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our final question from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sean Meakim","Hey, thanks. Just to continue on that line of questioning, you were characterizing the market or the supply for super-spec rigs as being limited in the press release and you\u2019re saying you think the market is fairly tight. We\u2019ve heard from your other peers this quarter; just offhand, I think the count as well over 100 rigs that they say are upgradable as a collective group. So you add that with yours.","Given the modest capital costs, how quickly these rigs can get these upgrades kind of in-between jobs, doesn\u2019t that suggest that we need to put a couple hundred more rigs back to work in this class in order to see pricing gains continue, or it seems like, honestly, you don\u2019t seem to agree with that?","John Lindsay","Sean, I\u2019ll make certain. I understood your question. So you\u2019re saying that we\u2019ve made the comment that there seem to be a tighter supply and you\u2019re suggesting that there\u2019s over a 100 that would be available outside of your\u2026.","Sean Meakim","Among your peers?","John Lindsay","\u2026among our peers, yes. And I think that\u2019s where if you start to think about it in terms of rather than looking at it as an entire fleet of rigs and focus on the rigs that are growing horizontal and directional wells that do have the higher capability needs not just, because somebody wants it, but because they need it.","That\u2019s when you start getting into more of a scarcity, where I think you have the potential for, at least, some pricing power, and I\u2019m not talking about $25,000 a day. I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m talking about getting additional getting higher rates and improving our margins. I\u2019m not making any sort of prediction on how high they might go. But I think that does begin to tighten the market.","I think the other element is that these rigs you can\u2019t just continue to drill the kind of wells that the industry is drilling and not get paid for it as a contractor. The rigs are working harder. You get 7,500 psi pumps. Engines are working harder. Pumps are working harder. We\u2019re using more consumables. Costs are going to have to, I think, you begin to put cost pressure in the equation.","So, I think, in general, we\u2019re going to see improved pricing. I think there is an opportunity to differentiate substantially over our peers, I think, that\u2019s as we have in the past, we\u2019re going to be able to command a premium.","Sean Meakim","I guess, what I was trying to get at is by last count earlier this year, there was perhaps like 300 super-spec rigs to use a round number, and another 400 across the rest of the group that could be upgraded to that under the conditions we discussed earlier, which are pretty simple. So if that\u2019s the case, what I\u2019m saying is, it seems like the supply of available rigs to do that kind of work, it seems like it\u2019s pretty considerable relative to where the horizontal rig count is today, and even though, there\u2019s a subset that\u2019s not necessarily looking for this pad-optimal work. So I just \u2013 that\u2019s what I was trying to get at is just the slack seems like there\u2019s still a good bit out there outside of the optionality you guys have?","John Lindsay","Right. Well, and that\u2019s part of the problem is it, it\u2019s not the quite the \u201csuper-spec\u201d rig isn\u2019t as transparent as I\u2019m sure everybody would like and I think everybody\u2019s to a degree working from a different definition. We\u2019ve seen a range published of 150 to 250 rigs that are \"supper-spec\u201d. There\u2019s a little over 700, 1,500 horsepower rig \u2013 AC rigs, but we don\u2019t believe all those have the capability to be upgraded to super spec capacity. They don\u2019t have the mass structure. They don\u2019t have the higher hook load capacity.","I think there\u2019s a fewer number of rigs than people are anticipating that are capable of doing the kind of work it\u2019s being done. But again, that that\u2019s our perspective. It\u2019s hard to nail it down, because you don\u2019t have all the facts.","Sean Meakim","Understood, that\u2019s a very fair point. Those would be important caveats. Just the last piece I guess to end this would be, for these upgrades that you are doing, are you effectively willing to fund them on spec, or is the idea that you need to get some level of increase in rate to justify that capital commitment?","John Lindsay","Well, up to this point, it\u2019s been the price of admission to work the rig in the areas, where it\u2019s been needed, and again, not all rigs needed, I think, what is it David, 80% of our working fleet is super-spec, is that I suppose.","David Hardie","Yes.","John Lindsay","So we still have customers that they don\u2019t need that the higher spec. So \u2013 but our intent is to get paid for that. I think, in general, we\u2019re probably getting paybacks in one to two years is kind of the way we\u2019re looking at it. But I think, in a lot of cases, that\u2019s going to be the price of admission to compete on these wells.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Yes, thanks for all that detail, John. I appreciate it.","John Lindsay","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to our speakers for closing comments.","John Lindsay","Hi, Tony, thank you. I want to just quickly thank each of you again for joining us on the call today. And before I \u2013 we sign off here just a couple of quick final thoughts just to reiterate, we believe our AC FlexRig fleet is positioned to take market share and a strong or even a moderate U.S. land market recovery.","We think we\u2019re uniquely leveraged to provide E&P companies the rig of choice to drill the more challenging horizontal wells. The design of our FlexRig fleet allows for a broad range of rig upgrades, providing a family of solutions for our customers. So we thank you again for your time and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect any time and have a great day."],"10703":["Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] And please note, today's call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO of Helmerich & Payne.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO; and John Lindsay, President and COO. As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to Hans Helmerich.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thanks, Juan Pablo. When you consider the challenging nature of the U.S. land rig count so far this year, we're pleased with today's results related to the performance of our drilling operations. Our overall field execution measured in terms of efficiency gains, safety, cost containment and margin resiliency, all continue to deliver strong showing. You'll hear from John Lindsay about a more detailed account of these results, but first, let me mention a couple of other highlights during the quarter.","First, the board approved a large dividend increase, bringing our annual payment to shareholders to $2 per share. The action not only makes good on the promise that we are willing to return excess cash to share owners, but also reflects a confidence looking forward and our ability to pursue in all of the above strategy. Meaning, our strong financial and strategic position provides a combination of growth opportunities, and at the same time, allows us to provide a meaningful dividend payout and the ability to consider additional share repurchases.","Also, most of you saw where we sold 1\/2 of our Atwood position at a substantial gain during the quarter. While we have no current plans for additional sales at this time, we have been clear about our intention over a reasonable time to further rationalize our remaining equity holdings in Atwood and Schlumberger.","If you had told us back in January that by the time of our July earnings call, oil prices would be well over $100 and that natural gas fundamentals and prices would be much improved and that the East Coast would be enjoying a nice warm summer, all of that would've put a bounce in our step. So while we would have expected by now to have seen more traction towards improved activity levels, we're not discouraged about the longer-term. We think improvement is coming, but is shifted slightly to the right. It seems reasonable that things have developed more slowly for several reasons.","The macroeconomic uncertainty has cast a downward bias over oil prices for a considerable period of time, leading to an extra measure of caution and capital spend discipline. The industry also seems to be catching its breath from a huge land rush and the associated activity around drilling to hold leases and better understand new areas as part of a massive shift into oil and liquid-rich plays.","At the same time, impressive efficiency gains have been realized, effectively acting as a certain buffer or cushion that allowed operators to do more with less and has provided more bang for their buck. Helping to capture these efficiency gains for customers has been central to our value proposition for over a decade. As drilling continues to become more complex and horizontal in nature, our differentiated performance will appeal to a growing customer base.","Even in this market, we're pleased with our steady progress, our ability to capture increased market share, our improving field performance and our leading position to be able to quickly respond to opportunities and to take advantage of what we still believe to be an improving market landscape in the months ahead.","Now I'm going to return the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Hans. Strong results from drilling operations under the very difficult quarter were primarily attributable to even better-than-expected performance in both the U.S. land and international land segment. In addition, the company realized almost $93 million in after-tax gains from sales of investment securities announced in May. And over $15 million in income from discontinued operation, elevating quarterly net income to $266 million, the highest in the company's history.","Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2013 remains at approximately $890 million, and total depreciation for the year is expected to be between $450 million and $460 million.","Our general and administrative expense for the year is expected to be between $125 million and $130 million, and our interest expense estimate, which is net of capitalized interest, is expected to be close to $6 million during fiscal 2013.","Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of June 30, 2013, was approximately $480 million. Our current liabilities as of that same date, however, included approximately $180 million to be paid during this fourth fiscal quarter related to a recently increased regular dividend, some debt that is due this year and income taxes corresponding to the recent sale of investment securities.","Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the first 9 months of the fiscal year and for the third fiscal quarter were 35.4% and 35.7%, respectively. We expect the effective rate for the fourth fiscal quarter to be slightly under 35%.","Our remaining investment portfolio recently had a total pretax market value of approximately $309 million, and an after-tax value of slightly under $200 million.","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. As you know, unconventional plays and horizontal drilling in the U.S. land market have changed the competitive landscape and raised the barriers of entry to the business by a shift to drilling more complex horizontal and directional wells.","Since our quarterly conference 1 year ago, we had -- we delivered 30 new build AC drive FlexRigs to the U.S. land market and increased our market share from 13% to 15%. During that same time period, mechanical and SCR rigs combined have lost approximately 11% market share and AC drive rigs have acquired that market share in the U.S. land sector. We view this as a clear indication the replacement cycle of old conventional rigs is ongoing. Mechanical and SCR rigs are going to the sideline and are being replaced by new technology AC drive rigs. And H&P FlexRigs continue to lead this replacement cycle.","We had another strong quarter, led by our U.S. land segment where our U.S. land operating income increased 4.6% quarter-over-quarter to $236 million, and revenue days increased approximately 3% to 22,510 days, representing approximately 247 average active rigs in the third fiscal quarter as compared to 243 active rigs in the prior quarter. We experienced a mix of term and spot market rigs for the quarter that averaged 160 rigs and 87 rigs, respectively.","Average rig revenue per day decreased by $95 sequentially to $28,160 a day and was largely unaffected by early termination revenue in the quarter as compared to approximately $70 per day contribution by early term revenue in the second quarter.","Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contracts during the third fiscal quarter was approximately 12% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. About half of this difference is attributable to softening day rates in the spot market during the last year as compared to day rates corresponding to term contracts, which were, in average, settled in a stronger market.","The rest is attributable to other factors including a different mix in the type of rigs, regions and additional services corresponding to the group of rigs in the spot market as compared to those under term contracts.","We were pleased with the third quarter results where average rig expense per day decreased by $339 per day sequentially, to $12,746 per day.","You've heard us talk about our organizational focus on cost management as part of the larger effort to leverage off of our growing fleet. Our field operations and back-office support have done an excellent -- exceptional job improving our daily operational expenses since the second quarter of 2012. We believe the consistency and operational expenses are a combination of many initiatives, including our new procurement system, improved processes and the operation of a standardized fleet of AC drive rigs designed and built by H&P.","And as a result, average margin per day increased by $244 to $15,414 per day for the third fiscal quarter. That is 64% and 75% greater than our 2 largest competitors.","In addition, during the third quarter, the U.S. land segment took delivery of 3 new build FlexRigs with term contract commitments. We plan to continue a build cadence of 2 FlexRigs per month for the rest of the calendar year. We continue to have encouraging conversations with customers regarding new builds with multiyear term contract commitments.","With our fleet size and continuity, we have the flexibility to build required capital spares and convert those into new FlexRigs as needed in the future.","Today, our rig -- our active rig count stands at 243 FlexRigs as compared to 246 rigs on June 30. Even with the choppy rig activity we are experiencing, we remain confident in the fourth fiscal quarter operational performance where we expect revenue days to be flat to down 1% compared to the third quarter.","We continue to have strong term contract coverage with 156 FlexRigs under term contracts and 87 operating in the spot market. With 243 active rigs, we have 55 available idle rigs, including 22 AC drive FlexRigs. We have averaged slightly over 20 stack AC FlexRigs per quarter beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012. Of the 22 stacked AC rigs, we have today over half of those rigs earn revenue during the last 2 quarters.","Even with the soft market conditions, we have experienced resiliency in spot market pricing, which is a reflection of the quality of our people, FlexRigs and the performance they are able to deliver to our customers. Assuming market conditions stay the same without any improvement to the fourth quarter, we expect average FlexRig revenue per rig day to be down approximately $100 to $200 per day. With our recent cost performance, we believe our average rig expenses will be $12,900 per day with a range of plus or minus 1% to 2%.","We expect approximately $7.7 million in early termination and approximately $5.2 million in delivery delay revenues for the fourth quarter. Our term contract coverage for future quarters remain strong. We currently have an average of 154 FlexRigs under term contracts for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, and an average of 141 FlexRigs for the first fiscal quarter of 2014 and an average of 113 rigs for all of fiscal '14.","Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we now expect average rig revenue per day for our rigs on term contracts to remain relatively flat for the remaining quarter of fiscal 2013, and to increase by approximately $100 per day in average during fiscal 2014. This is compared to the average rig revenue per day for rigs under term contract during the third fiscal quarter of 2013. Keep in mind that these references are only for rigs that are already under term contracts and exclude any future term contracts.","In the theoretical event that spot prices and utilization remain relatively flat through the end of fiscal 2014, and excluding cost that would be passed on to customers, the total average revenue per day for the segment during fiscal 2014 would be expected to decline by approximately 2% as compared to this year's third fiscal quarter.","Now a few comments regarding the offshore segment results for the third fiscal quarter. Offshore operating income increased by approximately 3% to $14.1 million as compared to the prior quarter.","Revenue days increased by 1% to 728 days as utilization remained constant at 89% for the segment. Average rig margin per day increased by $270 sequentially to $25,108 per day.","Now looking at the outlook for our offshore segment. As of today, we have 8 rigs active and 1 rig stacked. We expect 8 rigs to remain active throughout the fourth fiscal quarter. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to be up approximately 1% as we continue to operate 8 rigs. We expect our offshore margins to be relatively flat as compared to the previous quarter.","And now, a review of the international land segment where operating income decreased by approximately $4.7 million to $8.5 million. Now the primary factor driving the decrease was approximately $5.3 million of early termination revenue recognized in the second fiscal quarter.","Revenue days increased 5% to 2,132 days as overall segment utilization improved from 78% to 80%. Average rig margin per day decreased $2,462 to $8,591 per day. Excluding early termination revenues of approximately $2,600 per day in the second fiscal quarter, margins improved slightly. The outlook for international activity should improve for the fourth fiscal quarter.","Today, the International land segment has 26 of 29 rigs working, of which, 15 are AC drive FlexRigs. The active rigs by country include 7 in Argentina, 6 in Colombia, 6 in Ecuador, 3 in Bahrain, and 2 each in the UAE and Tunisia. We currently have 3 idle rigs, 2 are in Argentina, and 1 in Colombia.","As a result of this activity improvement, we expect international land revenue days to be up approximately 5% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of early termination revenue, we expect international margins to be up approximately 10% to 15% sequentially, as costs associated with rigs transferring between locations subside and standard drilling operations commence.","As a result of the exceptional performance of our FlexRigs in the Middle East and Latin America, we believe there is long-term growth potential for international land operation. However, even with the increased level of international interest, our bullish outlook is tempered by our experience that growth opportunities have tended to be more sluggish in international markets than we would have expected.","And in closing, we believe our FlexRigs technology offering, organizational competency and focus to deliver safe, efficient and cost-effective operations for our customers position H&P for long-term growth. Through this competency and focus, we continue to deliver tangible results today and over the long term. Even in the face of a challenging rig market like we've experienced in U.S. land over the past year, during the third quarter, we delivered quarterly and year-over-year improvements in rig activity and daily cash margins.","These achievements wouldn't have been possible without our people's commitment to the company's vision of providing save, efficient and cost-effective performance for our customers.","That completes my operating segment remarks, and now I'll return the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. And Tasha, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jim Crandell from Cowen.","James D. Crandell - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My first question has to do with new builds and it has to do both in the U.S. and Canada. Could you address, number one, with new builds, it seems you had a very strong market share over the course of this cycle, and competitors are recognizing new builds here this year. And it seems, on a very short-term basis, your market share has gone down. Do you think that, that's due to competitors taking less of a day rate that you're taking or it's just by chance and you'll reestablish leading market share as we go forward?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thanks, Jim. Well, first, we know very little bit about some of the points you bring up in terms of what the day rates are length of the term, construction cost. But if you think about the rig market today, it's been flattish at best and it's also oversupplied, even in the AC Tier 1 segment where you have 85 idle AC rigs industry-wide. The real oversupply, of course, is in the SCR and mechanical rig markets. And those have the challenge of not becoming more and more obsolete. So if a large part of your fleet is made up of that type of rig and you've been losing market share and you have new builds that are sitting on the ground, then you're a motivated seller in terms of place and new builds. Our situation is different than that, and we can afford to be more patient and we can let the market develop. We're not playing catch-up or having to rebuild our fleet. We have no mechanical rigs, as you know. We're not marketing any SCR rigs. And as our margins show, we're not discounting day rates today to buy up our activity. And our new build cadence serves kind of 2 purposes. One, it gives us the optionality for capital spares but it provides us an ability to respond quickly where we can take those same spares and they become building blocks for new rigs. So when you think about the rig cycle, typically, you absorb some of that overhang or some of that capacity, and then you begin to have customers interested in focusing on the type of rigs that they want. And that's where we think we'll see some attractive new build opportunity. So we've said before, Jim, that our toughest competition for new builds is our own AC drive FlexRigs. And we would expect those today S22, we would expect those rigs to be taken up in an improving environment and then that would lend itself to additional opportunities for new build. So all this says that we should remain patient and we're comfortable with both where our market share is and then also keeping with our manufacturing cadence.","James D. Crandell - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Do you think, Hans, as operators look for rigs in the future for term capabilities, that there is a marked preference in the eyes of many of them for the FlexRig6 versus the Flex 3 and that you'll see new builds because they really want the advanced capabilities of the FlexRig6?","Hans Christian Helmerich","I think, you're talking about the Flex 5.","James D. Crandell - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","5. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with next generation.","Hans Christian Helmerich","I'm glad you have that anticipation. Yes, I think that we're seeing the market shift to more and more pad-capable rigs. We lead in that space. And I think we're going to continue to see customers look for that. We've said -- we've talked about all of our pad-capable rigs are AC drives. So yes, certainly, I think that is where the future goes. And we're confident that we're going to play a leading role in that. I mean, remember, we've got a 15% overall market share. We've seen, and you mentioned it kind of in your question, we've seen our AC market share drop just from 40%, to, I think, 38%. At one point, I suppose we hit 100% of that market share. But if we can bring our 15% up -- everyone else is losing market share, we're gaining market share, if we can bring that 15% up, we can withstand and be patient if we have a few basis points of the overall AC share slip. But look, we're going to be a big player in the improving cycle and the ongoing demand for new builds.","James D. Crandell - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one last quick one. Hans, do you -- could Helmerich & Payne be a player for new builds up in the Horn River? There seems to be a lot of optimism about drilling for -- in advance of LNG requirements there. And certainly, they need the type of rigs that you make. Is that a market that you're looking at closely in terms of entering?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Yes, I'll let John speak more to that. But there are a couple of markets that are developing and it may be early, but still, I think we'd be well-suited for.","John W. Lindsay","Yes, Jim, I think, from a rig quality and the type of rig and the application, there's a great match. You've heard us say before that we're going to move rigs on a demand pool basis. We're not going to go in and try to buy up some market. If we have customer sponsorship and some of our larger customers would want to sponsor us somewhere like Canada or elsewhere, then we have interest in that. So we'll just see how it plays out.","James D. Crandell - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And you can be -- John, do you think you can be cost competitive in that market with new builds with transporting them up to Horn River?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I don't think that there's any question that from a cost of manufacturing and then mobilization, we mobilize rigs long distances, we have Canadian contractors that mobilize rigs, obviously, to the U.S., but I think there are some tax implications that are beneficial for the Canadian contractors. I don't know that for sure but I think that's right. So that's, obviously, a disadvantage. I don't want to leave you with the impression that this is top of mind and this is -- we're really aggressively pursuing that Canadian market. And as you know, there's very good Canadian contractors that have done a very good job with that market.","Operator","We'll move next to Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I was hoping to get a little update on what the leading-edge pricing dynamics are for the AC class rigs, both in terms of what the spot market dynamic is and then, what do you think the pricing dynamic is for these long-term contract commitments that you're ready to discuss? And can you give us some indication on how these pricing dynamics have changed over the course of the past quarter?","John W. Lindsay","Kurt, this is John. In general, I think, if you look at the last quarter and what we're talking about going into the fourth quarter is our spot pricing, we've estimated it being down 2% to 3%, that shifts the spot. When you say leading-edge, as you can imagine, we have different models of FlexRigs, and so some are larger, some are smaller, so there's a range there. In general, I would kind of frame it in a mid-20s type of a ballpark. But again, there's a lot of range there, depending on the operating area. Is it a winterized area, is it not a winterized area, what's the size of the equipment? But overall, for us, the trend has been -- has softened a little bit and it has since a year ago. But as we've said, I feel like we've held our own from that respect because of our performance. Did I answer your question? Was there more color you wanted there?","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I think. Yes, I wasn't quite sure on that leading-edge in the mid-20s, is that more of your contract dynamics? Or you were still referring to spot pricing on that?","John W. Lindsay","Well, that's spot pricing. Term contract pricing, obviously, is higher than that. As far as new build pricing would be -- again, it's going to be dependent upon the operating area. So in some cases, it's going to be above mid-20s. In some cases, it's going to be below mid-20s.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in light of the general lack of sense of urgency for putting new rigs to work or the increased drilling efficiency, however you want to put it, what's your sense on how your customers are looking at spending plans in the second half of the year. Do you get a sense that given the recent bump, and you indicated in your press release, but with the recent bump in oil prices, are you already getting an indication, Hans, that E&P companies are going to increase their spend in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, I think, what we're hearing is the improvement in commodity prices has been off of plan and you know that they did a lot of their budgeting in the $80, $85 range and stress test that down to $70 to $75. And I think that's the world they expected to see. And now, we're in a world where we have prices in excess of $100. So I think, what we're hearing anecdotally from folks is that, that's going to help, that's going to make a difference, that's going to drive cash flows, natural gas pricing is better than we had budgeted as well, and I think all of that moves, yes, Kurt, into an emboldened outlook for the rest of this calendar year, and then, certainly, will get some momentum going, assuming commodity prices hold, get some momentum going into '14. So I think that we're hearing a more upbeat sense from our customers and discussions.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Your rig count in the Permian has continued to track higher, even though the overall rig count in the basin has been relatively flattish. So clearly, you're taking some market share there. So my question is which FlexRig design seems to be resonating with customers in that region the most? And as you think about growing your rig count, let's say, over the next 12 to 18 months in the Permian, does it have any notable implications for your overall fleet average day rates and margins? I'm assuming the answer is no, but I'd just like to hear your thoughts on it.","John W. Lindsay","Yes, Byron, this is John. I think, the -- probably, the rig of choice has probably been the FlexRig3, and in some cases, there is a pad application. Most cases, at this stage, there isn't, but there are some pad applications. We have the FlexRig4, super single that we have, I think, almost all of those in the U.S. are working in the Permian. And that's been a real popular rig design as well, and we've built a couple of those new in the last year. But I think, the majority of the demand is going to be for FlexRig3, the 1,500-horsepower fast rig moves to drill the horizontal wells. I think that's where we've gotten most of our growth. As far as the pricing, no, I don't expect, at this stage, that there would be an increase in pricing in that basin and it having an impact of improving the overall pricing going forward, not with what we see right now.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just a second question for me. Juan Pablo, you mentioned the fiscal '13 CapEx budget is $890 million roughly. Materially, to say, given that we're approaching the end of your fiscal year kind of directionally,","how you guys are thinking about fiscal '14, just thinking directionally, does it feel higher, flattish, lower year-over-year?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Well, we will be talking more about that during our next conference call. We're going to have related meetings to look at the prospects, et cetera. At this point, it's a little early to -- for us to talk about that, Byron, sorry.","John W. Lindsay","Byron, this is John. I wanted to add, we do have -- I just remembered, we have had some conversations as well on FlexRig5s in the Permian as well. But again, we're still a little bit early on as much as the pad drilling as we've seen as an example in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken. But I do think we'll have FlexRig5s. As that market matures and goes to more pad drilling, I think, we'll see that happen.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Wilson with Howard Weil.","David Wilson - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","First, just wondering on rig efficiencies and how much is left out there? Is it just a matter of the industry more fully deploying the best rigs or more pad drilling or is there something else? And do these efficiency gains mean we can expect kind of an acceleration of the older, more legacy rigs maybe to the sidelines sooner rather than later?","Hans Christian Helmerich","I'll let John do some of that, but yes, I think, the sense of your question is right. But the bar just gets placed higher and higher and as you have more horizontal drilling, more well complexity, John talked about even in the Permian, if you had told us that we'd have had the market share made up from Flex 3s and now Flex 5s in the Permian, it just speaks to, Dave, what your question is getting at. So I think the performance bar is higher and that really suits us well. I also think, when you look at our performance, our efficiency capture, based on footage drilled, has gone up considerably. Last year, over the previous year, year-to-date, it's up an impressive number as well. So we keep finding ways. John, can give more detail on that, but we keep finding ways to improve our performance. And I think, the customer and our brand reputation is for doing that. And so the collaboration and the partnership that we have with customers continues to drive better performance. The other aspect that we uniquely bring, that I don't think our competitors with their different fleet type, sizes, ages, predominance of older rig classes, we bring the uniformity and the all AC drive offering that allows us to push, not only that cutting-edge efficiency, but overall field efficiency, overall customer roster performance, bringing the very best well in the field and closing that delta with the other average and less highly performing wells. So that's a very attractive capture from a customer standpoint. And we're uniquely positioned to continue to drive that as we're doing today. John, did you want to add something to that?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Dave, when you consider the number of AC rigs working today versus even a year ago, and you start considering several hundred mechanical and SCR rigs going to the sideline, increasing number of AC rigs, and of course, the rigs that go to the sideline that represent the mechanical and the SCR rigs are going to be the bottom of the barrel, right? I mean, they're going to be the lower-end performers. So from just an overall industry and rig count perspective, it shouldn't be any surprise that efficiencies are improving. And then when you start looking at it on a comparative basis, let's just use the Flex 3 as an example, we continue to see, even with all the improvements that we've seen over the last 3 years, we continue to see improvements in 2013. And as we've said before, Dave, it's not just the rig, it's a lot of other things associated with the rig and working together as a team with your customer. But I still think there's significant performance improvements that can be made. When you consider what -- when you consider our best-in-class well or the technical limit and you compare that to our average well on the field, there's still quite a bit of opportunity, I think, ahead for us.","David Wilson - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, just kind of sticking with the efficiency theme here, on the cost front, how you guys have done the cost management, do you think this quarter is kind of indicative of the best it can get as far as from a cost perspective, $12,700 per rig? Are you thinking you're better than that? Or is that going to kind of reach the kind of technical limit there as well?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think, we've been a little lower in previous quarters, but the variables change quarter-to-quarter. Again, in some previous quarters, we hadn't stacked as many rigs and then reactivated as many rigs. So there's a lot of moving parts that are taking place. The demands that our customers have in terms of drilling these wells, when we talk about efficiency gains, yes, it's large part, it's because you've got a better technology rig. But we're also running the equipment quite a bit harder than we did 2 or 3 years ago. And so, obviously, when you're running equipment harder, equipment wears out more quickly, you go through more expendables, which drive cost up. And so that's -- part of our message and part of what Hans talked about earlier is our efficiency gains, we're also working to what we know or how do you maintain a better cost structure, how do you maintain a better maintenance schedule in order to drive your operational cost. At least keep them flat and hopefully drive them down, even in the case where you're working the rigs significantly harder than you did a couple of years ago. So to answer your question, I think, the $12,900 plus or minus 1% to 2%, based on what we know right now, I think, makes a lot of sense. We have had some quarters in the past year, 1.5 years, I think, that we were slightly under the $12,700, but I don't see us going to those levels right now.","Hans Christian Helmerich","David, the only thing I would add to that is I think it's a real accomplishment of our folks, and you watched it with us for several quarters now and it's the result of -- it's more than just trying hard, it's good systems, it's managing costs. We see that as being a competitive advantage. When you look at the cost experience of some of our peers and what John just said about, hey, this is a business where we're running that equipment hard and that's going to become more and more of a challenging mark to set. So I think we continue to have a lot of focus on it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robin Shoemaker from Citigroup.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Hans, I wanted to ask you, on the new building program, you didn't announce new term contracts signed for new builds, I believe, this quarter. You did announce 2 back in April, and I think 3 in January. So anyway, I think, the right number is 5 year-to-date. And you're building them at a pace of -- faster pace, of course. And I assume we're coming up with this cadence that you have now of 2 per month to a point where you're delivering some rigs that don't have term contracts. So kind of wondering whether you believe you should hold off to get a term contract for a new build FlexRig or offer that into the spot market?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thanks, Robin, and thanks also for getting the count right. You were correct. Part of what happens, I suppose, is you have some misinformation out there. One of our peers this week talked about that we had only announced 8 new builds under long-term contract since the first of 2012, when, in fact, the number is much higher at that 17. And part of that depends on where you also capture the time bracket. Had they gone back a little further, the comparison would have been our 72 new build orders to their 25. So we're talking about a snapshot in time this quarter. We didn't have any announcements. I talked about part of that is patience being a virtue because, in fact, you watch this market closely, you know we're not at a stage where you would normally be in the cycle at a point where you have a lot of new build announcements. And so what people are doing is they're using their new builds to stem the loss and to stop the bleeding of market share and watching their activity go down. So we can be more patient than that. And when I think of our 2 rig cadence, we're very new into a place where we haven't had all of these rigs under new -- under long-term contracts. And we've talked with you before and others that we've run at 0 spares for so long because we could pull them out of our manufacturing queue that we're still in that phase. We're unitizing capital spares and we're having, in effect, the ability to either support a growing and larger fleet with those spares or turn those into, in essence, equipment kits that become fully commissioned rigs. So that's where we are today. We have that optionality. As we go forward, we've talked about our line of sight with say, we're very comfortable with building 2 rigs per month through the end of the year. And we can continue to watch that and monitor that and we look at that. We're doing that because we think the market is going to improve and there's going to be a right time to put those rigs into a fully commissioned status and place them under a long-term contract. And so we'll bide our time. We'll be patient. We hope the market trends that way. We think it will, but I think we're in a good spot right now.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So on the 22 idled FlexRigs that you mentioned, clearly, there's a trade-off there. You probably could put it all back to work at a lower price. You're defending a price level, so would that be the strategy is just say, okay, here's a level clearly which we won't go? Or where do you really want to get the majority of those idle rigs working?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, it's a fair observation, and you're right. And you see it in our operating margins. You see it in our spot day rates. You see where we've had the type of resiliency that John gave you some detail on earlier. I've got a lot I'd like to say on that. We're not really going to talk a lot about our pricing strategy on this call. But I do think that we're focused on the type of returns we're generating, and again, we believe that the market is improving. So we thought it was ill-advised for competitors to try to deeply discount even their top-tier rigs just in order to try to capture some activity. The delta between our activity today and theirs is still significant. So I better stop before I say more about our pricing strategy because that's a competitive secret, of course.","Operator","We'll move next to Ryan Fitzgibbon with Global Hunter Securities.","Ryan Fitzgibbon - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, if I can touch on some of your commentary. You mentioned that your fleet mix hold is unchanged here that average fiscal '14 day rate would decline by about 2% relative to Q3. If we assume cost hold unchanged at, call it, 12,900, are you more or less guiding for margins to get to mid to upper $14,000 per day range next year?","John W. Lindsay","Well, we were trying to just give a theoretical picture because, sometimes, it's less clear on the impact of the term contracts and the roll-off and how that pricing varies.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, this is Juan Pablo. And Ryan, I think your assumption is, in general, correct, that a couple of percentage points on the revenue per day number would represent the delta that you described of having an impact on our average rig margin per day of $500, $600, $700 or so. But that is only a theoretical scenario. It's not -- we're not providing guidance and it's not really -- at this point, our expectation is that we will see flat spot day rates through the end of fiscal '14, we certainly hope that they improve as a matter of fact. But nonetheless, we just wanted to provide you a sense of what would happen if spot pricing would remain more or less flat through the end of fiscal '14 and utilization levels would remain more or less where they are today. Hopefully, that's helpful.","Ryan Fitzgibbon - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. My follow-up question would be, John, you also mentioned some opportunities, maybe internationally. You're cautious, but are you expecting anything to materialize next year whether it be in the Middle East or Latin America based on the tendering activities you're seeing?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Ryan, we're participating in several tenders. I mean, you've followed us long enough, you know that there's been some frustration on our part that we haven't grown internationally more quickly than we have, particularly when you consider the performance that FlexRigs has had in the areas that they've worked. Again, we're hopeful, and I think, particularly most recently in the Middle East, the performance that the Flex 3s have had and the Flex 4s have continued to have, I think, there's been some eyes opened on what's possible. We still have the challenges that are there, so our hope is that we can work through those challenges. And then, we have one Flex 3 working in Neuqu\u00e9n area in the shale play, a Flex 3, that's done a very good job. And again, our hope is that, that will also open up some opportunities for us. But as far as any in particular, and trying to nail a number on whether 3 rigs or 10 rigs, it's really hard to say at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, if I could follow up on the pad issue. Earlier this week, Halliburton commented that they thought upwards of half of the rigs in the major shales were working on pad right now. If I think about the competitive advantage of AC over older SCRs, one is, obviously, the move time and two is ROP. Does rapid move -- I guess, first of all, would you agree with that number? And secondly, with such a rapid uptake, has the competitive advantage of ACs over SCRs on the move front been adversely impacted? And I'm wondering if once we sort of reach a saturation point, if the ROP isn't an accelerant for substitution again?","John W. Lindsay","Well, if I understand your question, first of all, I think, it's hard -- I don't think -- we didn't have enough information to know if 50% of the industry. In our own particular case, we're around 50% in the unconventionals in our pad drilling application. There's no doubt the AC, or at least with our fleet, FlexRig3 is going to move quite a bit faster than a conventional SCR rig. We're going to, in some cases, we're going to move in half the time. So in the case where you add a pad system to a conventional rig, then yes, it improves its overall well cycle from the rig move segment significantly. And so it's going to have maybe a greater impact than adding a pad system to, say, a FlexRig3. On the other hand, that's really only 10% of the time on a well. And so the drilling piece of the well is going to be just the drilling performance. And you said penetration rate, I'm going off top of my head, but I'm going to say depending on the area, that's 25% to 35% of the well. But there's a lot of other factors included in the total well cycle besides penetration rate that AC drive rigs provide. Our FlexRigs are going to -- they're going to run casing more efficiently, they're going to nipple up and test more efficiently. There's a lot of aspects that kind of goes back to this designing a rig with a clean sheet of paper and not just looking at the technology of AC drive but also looking at the other aspects of what make up cycle time savings in a full well cycle. Rig move is one of them, drilling time is one of them, the other things that I mentioned, as well as others that make up that time savings. So what we see is, obviously, a lot of energy around the pad drilling application. And I can understand that, and particularly as you're looking at it from an SCR owner's perspective, there's a lot of advantages there. But there's a lot of other things that are captured in the course of the well cycle that we remain pretty excited about.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's great color. And then, as I think about 20 to 22 idle rigs, with fleet your size, with as much activity as you have in the spot now and contracts rolling over, how should we think about sort of frictional dynamics and what true max utilization on the fleet of your size is? And spot versus term mix?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, that's a great observation, 20 or 22 rigs. We're at 92% or a little 92% utilization. The industry's AC rig count, I want to say, today is around 86%. You take H&P out of the equation, the overall AC utilization, obviously, is going to be less than 86%. When you take those 20 rigs and you consider 4 of those are in California, so those are a little stranded to a certain extent, then you've got a couple others rigs and so you spread the remaining 18 over 9 basins, that doesn't give you a lot of excess capacity when you think about it in those terms. So Hans alluded to it. We're not concerned about it. We're not panicking about it. Yes, we'd love to put those rigs back to work. I think we will. And really, we have. Over the course of the last 9 months, we've continued to put rigs that are stacked back to work, but we've also had rigs released that we didn't expect were going to be released that then went into stack mode. So that's kind of what you're seeing. We've described it as churn. Your comment using frictional unemployment as an example on people sizes, frictional rig unemployment, I think it makes a lot of sense.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. On emerging basins, are you seeing any accelerated interest in rig demand for Utica or maybe some on the mid-con liquids plays?","Hans Christian Helmerich","We've had discussions, and I can't think of specific examples in the Utica. But there have been some discussions, but I don't see any dramatic growth there. I'd say our largest growth potential, at least for the foreseeable future, is going to be the Permian. But there has been some discussions in the mid-continent in Oklahoma. Those discussions shouldn't be a surprise, those discussions are surrounded mostly around we've got these old mechanical rigs, it's about 1,000-horsepower, that take 6, 7 days to move, FlexRig can move in 3 days. So obviously, there's the hurdle there on the day rate. But the numbers work. And so, I think, as we begin to get more uptake on that, I think we've got some opportunities to high-grade on some rigs. The other thing I didn't talk about in my prepared remarks is the new customers, and you've heard us talk about this in the past, we've got a lot of really -- we've got a lot of great new customers and we also have a lot of new customers that happen to be small independents. And those are the guys that are typically using some of the older rigs and they begin to use FlexRigs. And so that's been exciting to see. And it doesn't make up a really large number of rigs but I think what it does portray is that there's this value proposition realization and that you can pay more for a rig if you're getting the value proposition that we talk about.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, we hear about a trend of E&P bringing in smaller rigs to drill the vertical section of the well in the Eagle Ford and let the Tier 1 kind of rigs drill the horizontal sections. Are you seeing that? And how pervasive is that?","John W. Lindsay","Waqar, that's been -- I can remember probably 2006, 2007 when operators couldn't get rigs and they would utilize that for a different reason. Our position has always been, and actually, when we've talked to customers that have tried it, is the numbers from a cost perspective, the numbers don't work. I mean, if you really think about it, you've got 2 rig moves, the rig that you're bringing in, the small drilling surface or the intermediate, if it's intermediate, that rig is going to be very inefficient. Again, as comparing it to, say, a FlexRig3. In a lot of cases, we're going to drill that intermediate section of a hole in half the time. The only time I would think that it makes sense, and again, I'm using a historical perspective, is if you just can't get access to the rigs and you're holding production or you're trying to get ahead of the curve in that respect. I'm not aware of that happening today in the Eagle Ford, I'm not aware of any of our customers doing that. And if you're talking about free-setting surface, and again, surface could be 500 feet or 1,500 feet, then that's a different animal. That -- we do have customers that are doing that, and that makes a lot of sense in some cases.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. We've seen like if you look at the Baker Hughes rig count and they break it down in the basins, in the Eagle Ford, you've seen that the directional rig count has gone from like 1 or 2 rigs to about 35, 36 rigs in the space of about 5, 6 months, and 1 horizontal rig count has come down and we were trying to think about any explanation for that. I don't know if you've looked at that data and if you have an explanation of why, what is that trend about?","John W. Lindsay","And what -- how did you describe the -- you said -- I didn't hear what you said on what type of rig?","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The directional rig, in the Baker Hughes rig count, the breakup in these basins, the rig count between vertical, directional and then horizontal, and what you've seen in the Eagle Ford is the directional rig count has gone from like 1 to 2 about 4 or 5 months ago to about 35. And at the same time, the horizontal rig count has come in a little bit. And so we were trying to figure out what that 35 rig count increase is and one explanation was maybe people are bringing in smaller rigs to drill the vertical section or maybe a little directional section. So -- but I don't know if you've looked at that and if you have an explanation for that?","John W. Lindsay","I don't know that we've noticed but I was curious if are those wells, those directional that they're -- are they still drilling oil wells?","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That is correct, yes.","John W. Lindsay","I don't have an explanation for that, I guess.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. The other thing is if you look at all the kind of growing basins or major basins, one of them where you don't have good penetration of Tier 1 AC rigs is the Mississippian, and it has traditionally been dominated by private drilling contractors with a lot of mechanical rigs. I don't know if you were referring to that basin or others, but are you seeing any change there in terms of operator behavior and leaning towards more of these Tier 1 rigs?","John W. Lindsay","When I think about the Mississippian, obviously, it's a different formation, but from a depth perspective and lateral, it has a lot of similarities with the Barnett. And if you recall, the Barnett early on was dominated by mechanical rigs, and over time, you saw what happened. And the mechanical rigs, for the most part, went away and AC rigs and there were a lot of upgraded SCR rigs. But I think, by far, the AC rig market dominated in the Barnett when it was really active. So that would be my expectation. I guess, part of the question is does the laterals get longer? How efficient are the rigs? Are they doing pad drilling? Or are they doing single wells? I think, it will change over time. Our rig count has grown in the Mississippian over the last couple of quarters. So -- but your point is a good one. As far as the type of operators, I'm not particularly aware who the others are.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just final question. If you would care to comment on your outlook for the overall industry rig count by the end of the year, do you -- what kind of growth or no growth do you see by late this year? And then, maybe even for next year?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Waqar, this is Hans. As you know, that top line kind of headline rig count number becomes less and less relevant. And as you track the different segments, the 2 underperforming segments continue to lose share in AC, even in a kind of softer market continues to gain. So you're also going to have efficiency as a factor, and I mentioned operators are getting more bang for their buck. That, in our mind, is not a bad thing. Efficiency is not the enemy. Efficiency is what helps differentiate our offering from the group. So we're focused less and less on that number. I think, it could still edge up with oil prices over $100, and I don't think it's a '13 event. But I think it doesn't take a lot of positive things to happen on the natural gas front to see it having a factor in 2014, and certainly in '15, it's set up nicely. So we're overall encouraged on those things. But we would encourage people to watch the subset of what's happening with the AC count, what's happening with horizontal drilling and that's what probably they should be paying more attention to.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But the horizontal rig count is actually being the one that's been kind of weak, year-to-date, it's been coming down. And that's probably because of efficiency gains. Do you see that trend continuing?","Hans Christian Helmerich","I think, that is a short-term phenomenon. I think it ends up -- I mean, more and more customers and more and more plays are trying to expose more and more wellbore and you do that by going horizontally.","Juan Pablo Tardio","If we do have more questions. Perhaps we have time for one more.","Operator","We actually just have one question left. We'll move next to Walt Chancellor with Stephens Inc.","Walter Chancellor - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick question regarding the Q4 U.S. drilling guidance. On the average rig revenue per day number, is that inclusive of the $7.7 million in early termination? And then, $5 million in delivery delay revenues?","Juan Pablo Tardio","No, it is not. Yes, that is a good question. Thanks for clarifying that.","Walter Chancellor - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, on an as-reported basis, would both of those get captured in the drilling segment in that figure?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, they will. Thank you very much, everybody. Have a good day. Goodbye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day."],"10858":["Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

The company is well positioned to successfully manage the new market dynamics.","Organizational effectiveness initiatives implemented during the downturn have enhanced our ability to respond to demand and add value to our customers. H&P's fleet uniformity and size afford us scale that is unmatched in the U.S. land AC drive segment and is providing us with opportunities to capture additional market share.","FlexRig technology, supported by our integrated business model, has a track record of over 1,900 rig years and is the preferred AC drive rig offering in the marketplace. We are excited about what lies ahead in the future.","We have referenced our integrated business model in the past, and this morning, I plan to expand on the good things that are happening because of this approach and point to some examples of how this model benefits the company and our customers.","At the heart of this strategy is an organization that is increasingly geared to capture experience and design, construction and technology, and then to mesh that with the learnings we glean everyday from our field operations. This capability is allowing us to upgrade to FlexRig to meet the specific needs of a customer as well as provide the best technology, reliability and results, which ultimately delivers our value proposition to both customers and shareholders.","Having a uniform fleet of FlexRigs enables us to provide a Family of Solutions for our customers; a fleet designed to adapt to the future technology needs in the market and the capacity to deliver the right rig for their project. Here is where this is paying dividends.","Today, we lead the industry with 122 super-spec capable FlexRigs in the U.S. Land market and another 50 rigs that are currently active and can also be upgraded to super-spec capability. The current and informal industry definition for super-spec capability refers to rigs with at least the following attributes: AC drive technology, 1,500 horsepower drawworks capacity, 750,000 pound hook load rating, 7,500 psi mud systems, and multiple well pad drilling capability.","H&P not only has a significant lead in active super-spec rigs, but we also have approximately 100 idle AC FlexRigs that are candidates for upgrade to super-spec status should there be market demand to do so. This represents about two thirds of the number of idle high-spec AC drive rigs in the U.S. land industry fleet today.","Uniform design characteristics allow us to upgrade FlexRigs to super-spec capability in a very capital efficient manner utilizing the lean manufacturing approach we successfully employed during our previous expansion. At this early stage in past cycles, we would've been sold out of FlexRigs, but today, we are positioned to respond quickly to demand across the spectrum of our customers' drilling needs.","Most in our industry have a more challenging position to contend with, but here are few considerations to ponder as you think about the next several quarters and how they could play out. As you may recall, during the downturn from late 2014 to hitting bottom in the summer of 2016, all E&Ps across the industry were releasing rigs regardless of rig specifications or performance.","We were idling over 200 AC drive FlexRigs, while many of our competitors were idling AC drive rigs as well as idling hundreds of old conventional rigs. At the trough rig count last summer, we had approximately 280 idle AC drive FlexRigs in the U.S. Land segment. After leading the charge in terms of rig redeployments and market share gains, we currently have approximately 170 idle AC drive FlexRigs available to return to work and approximately 100 of those are 1,500 horsepower AC drive FlexRigs that can quickly be upgraded to super-spec capability.","In contrast, most of the industry seems to be in a position where they will have to build or buy AC drive rigs in order to grow their activity level in a meaningful way. Note also that rig specification requirements have been increasing during this recovery, so non-AC rigs are mostly redundant today.","If we were to assume, and we realize that maybe a big if, but if market continues to improve over the coming years, we could very feasibly exceed H&P's 2014 peak level of quarterly activity of approximately 300 active rigs in the U.S. with our existing FlexRig fleet, including the upgrades required for the rigs drilling more complex wells.","Other large land drillers in the segment are currently experiencing activity levels of less than or close to half of their 2014 peak levels, and are reportedly already constrained to grow using their existing idled rigs, many of which are not suitable for upgrades.","Our strategy going forward is to continue growing market share in this favorable environment. We don't foresee investing in new rigs at this stage of the cycle, especially as we continue to demonstrate we can upgrade our fleet to meet the needs in the market and deliver best-in-class performance with our FlexRig fleet.","And now I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. You may have noticed that we are now providing additional data in our press release, including some reference tables in the back. I will expand on some of the announced information on each of our three drilling segments, followed by some comments on corporate level details.","On our U.S. Land drilling segment; first, let me highlight our continuing success in reactivating FlexRigs. Since the last earnings call on January 26, 2017, we have put 42 FlexRigs to work, which is the equivalent to delivering a FlexRig to active status every 52 hours. Of those rigs, 37 are in the spot market and five on term contract.","The Permian led the way with 21 rigs, 10 in the Eagle Ford, three in the SCOOP and STACK play, two each in the Bakken and Haynesville, and one a piece in the Barnett, Piceance, Utica and Woodbine.","From a FlexRig model perspective, 35 of the 42 were FlexRig3s, four were FlexRig4s, and three were FlexRig5s. As we commented on the last call, we continue to have great demand for the FlexRig3. It is the workhorse of the fleet and delivers great value for the customer on single well and pad applications. Of these 35 rigs, approximately half were classified as super-spec. We have also added eight new customers since the last call and momentum has been building as a result of the performance our folks are delivering.","Our three most active basins today are the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the SCOOP and STACK play. The Permian remains our most active operation and we have 80 rigs contracted coming off a low of 38 contracted rigs, and at one point last summer, we only had 23 actively operating rigs.","We have 50 idle FlexRigs in the area, 31 of which are 1,500 horsepower, and we expect to continue to have opportunities to grow our active fleet in the Permian. For perspective, we had 85 rigs contracted in the Permian during the 2014 peak. In the Eagle Ford and SCOOP and STACK today, we have 30 and 29 rigs contracted, coming off the low of 16 and 15 contracted rigs, respectively.","As for the overall U.S. Land segment results corresponding to the second fiscal quarter, we exited the quarter with 168 contracted rigs, driving a remarkable increase of approximately 35% in total quarterly revenue days. The increasing proportion of rigs priced under recent market conditions drove the 7% decline in adjusted average rig revenue per day to $22,201 in the quarter. The average rig expense per day increased by about 4% to $15,612, mostly driven by upfront expenses on a larger-than-expected number of rigs returning to work.","No early termination notices for rigs in this segment have been received since last summer. But, given prior notifications, we expect to generate approximately $5 million during the third fiscal quarter and a total of over $18 million during several quarters thereafter in early termination revenues.","Looking ahead at the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect continued improvement in activity and a sequential increase of roughly 25% in quarterly revenue days. With average spot pricing up 9% since our last call and currently in the high teens, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $21,000. The average rig expense per day level is expected to significantly decrease to roughly $14,300 as rigs start-up expenses sequentially have a lower level of impact on the average during the third fiscal quarter.","One important consideration is that about half of our 177 contracted rigs today are under term contracts, and roughly two-thirds of our rigs under term contracts were priced during strong market before the 2014 downturn. The remaining rigs under term contract, approximately 30, were priced during the downturn and have a remaining average duration of less than one year. As a result, the current expected average rig margin per day for all of our rigs under term contracts in the segment during the next few quarters is in the $12,000 to $13,000 range.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. The number of quarterly revenue days decreased by approximately 8% as we exited the second fiscal quarter with six contracted rigs. The average rig margin per day increased sequentially by about 3% to $10,817. Management contracts contributed approximately $4 million to operating income.","As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2017, quarterly revenue days are expected to decrease by approximately 10% to 15%, exiting the quarter with five contracted rigs. Average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $12,500. In collaborating with a long-term customer, we sold one of the company's idle offshore rigs to an E&P company that recently acquired the corresponding offshore platform from our customer.","Moving on to our international land operations, the previously announced early termination notice from a customer for five rigs under long-term contracts in Argentina had a significant impact on both activity and margins. We exited the quarter with eight contracted rigs, and quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 25%. The adjusted average rig margin per day decreased sequentially to under $4,000.","As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2017, quarterly revenue days are expected to decrease by approximately 10%, averaging over 8.5 active rigs during the third fiscal quarter as we now expect to exit the quarter with 10 or 11 active rigs.","The two to three incremental rigs at the end of the quarter relate to our customer in Argentina withdrawing the mentioned early termination notice for five rigs and indicating its intention to farm out most of those rigs to another operator. The average rig margin per day is expected to remain under $4,000 given the low level of utilization in the segment.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to be in great position to sustain regular dividend levels along with ample flexibility to take advantage of opportunities going forward.","The effective income tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2017 is expected to be around 32%. This relatively low rate is primarily related to foreign jurisdictions where tax benefits associated with operating losses remain uncertain.","Let me now turn the call back to John.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Pablo. There's a lot of industry talk regarding new builds by contractors in U.S. land, especially since the market has improved and the rig count has increased sufficiently to put pressure on the capability of the competitor fleet. One of the obvious barriers to rapid expansion of new builds is new build economics, meaning rates are currently too low to support investing in new rigs.","So, while many of our peers may be forced to build new rigs at questionable economics to grow their AC drive fleets, we have been able and expect to continue to be able to maintain an industry-leading cadence by upgrading and reactivating FlexRigs.","Since last September, our active fleet has increased by 89 rigs, including close to 60 rigs upgraded to super-spec capability. The technology and scale advantages we have with a uniform fleet of AC drive FlexRigs is significant. Our uniform fleet provides a platform to deploy technology and we believe this will continue to serve us well as technologies evolve.","One measure of this is best illustrated by the success we have enjoyed in growing our U.S. land market share from 15% to 19% since the peak in 2014. The industry's capacity to provide additional super-spec technology rigs in a timely and cost effective way is another example of why most of the industry idle fleet may be limited in its ability to respond to the higher levels of well complexity, which positions H&P very well for future expansion.","Finally, for H&P, the driving force behind this success is our people. Our ability to succeed is enabled by attracting and hiring, training and promoting the best people as they're the ones tasked with delivering industry-leading performance. Thanks to each of them as they have responded in a remarkable fashion during this upturn.","And now, Aaron, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly And we can take our first question from Colin Davies with Sanford C. Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Well, thank you very much and good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Talk a little bit about your earlier comments at the beginning where you perhaps alluded to maybe the pace of growth of active rigs may be slowing a little bit. Are you actually seeing that in the current quarter? Or is that something you're anticipating as you go forward? And then I got one more follow-up.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Colin, I would say that we're seeing less enquiries on rigs. We're still receiving enquiries, but not to the same level \u2013 not to the same pace that we were previously. Of course, you have to kind of put that in perspective. This has been \u2013 at least for us, it's been an increase in activity that we've never seen before. So it's not really surprising that we're seeing it pull back a little bit. That was our expectation.","Quite frankly, my expectation would've been it would've pulled back a little sooner than what it has. So, again, we're still getting requests, we still see the fleet growing through the rest of the quarter. As you probably heard us say before, it's very challenging to see much past a month or two. We're going to be effectively growing based on what our customers are seeing in the future.","Obviously, oil prices, the softness that we've experienced over the last month or so has not helped matters any. But, again, I think in general, if you see the rig count, where it is right now, depending on the rig count that you look at between 830 to 900 rigs, has really far exceeded anybody's expectation, I think. So I don't think any of us should really be surprised that it slowed down just a little bit.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, that makes sense. And I guess, related to that, given the very high inventory of upgradable rigs that you guys have and that you were talking about earlier, presumably, you can sort of level set the cadence of those upgrades to that rig count outlook. And does that mean that the $14,300 OpEx starts to come down perhaps a little bit more rapidly as we go into the next few quarters?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think that's a reasonable expectation. As we've said, that's what's driving \u2013 that's what's driven the higher levels of cost per day. As we've said before, kind of on average, the working rigs have been in that $13,000 to $13,500. It's been the reactivations that's been driving those costs higher.","Juan Pablo, you have anything more to add?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think that's exactly right on.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That was great. Thank you very much.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Colin. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Timna.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Timna.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I want to ask one \u2013 to start with one broader question on the industry, because on the one hand in John's comments, he was saying that because some of your competitors may be forced to build rigs uneconomically. And then he also said that they may not be able to expand because of less attractive economics, so just wanted to get a little more color on your expectations in terms of the discipline in the industry on adding rigs in tandem with the growing demand. Thanks.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, Timna, well, I think there's not been a large scale discussion regarding new rigs, but there have been some new rigs that have been announced and, obviously, some new rigs that are continuing to be built. Based on what we're seeing, I think there's probably 10 or so if you were to add them all up. And obviously, there were some kits that were involved that had been previously acquired. So maybe that's part of what's driving it.","I think in general though, when you look at the overall fleet of rigs that are working today and the number of those rigs that, again, to use the super-spec capability, and then those that have the ability to be upgraded to super-spec, best we can tell, there is a fairly limited amount of rigs there. So I think in order to see a significant growth going forward, that may be what many of our peers are faced with, is building new rigs as opposed to having a fleet that can scale up like what we've been able to do and meet that demand. Again, that's kind of our assumption at this point.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So you're in better position relative to peers. But do you think that peers are going to make the right economic decision and decide to be more measured in their growth or do you have any concerns about the pace of new rigs relative to this slower demand environment, albeit from high levels?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, it's pretty hard for us to say. Again, all we've heard is that there's about 10 rigs and most of those rigs, I think, the kit or at least half of the kit or so had already been acquired back in either 2013 or 2014. So it's really hard for us to say.","All we can really do is we're trying to create context of where we are in the market cycle. As I said in my remarks, in previous cycles, we would've more than likely been out of FlexRigs. And we're in a great position today in that we have that idle capacity that can be upgraded. Obviously, we have some rigs that are \u2013 50 rigs that are running right now that can be upgraded to higher capacity if need be.","And I think that's really one of the questions that is unanswered. Nobody knows for sure, but how many of the higher spec classification rigs are going to be required? The sense is, we continue to have requests from customers to upgrade existing rigs or as they're bringing a new rig out, they're wanting to see those rigs upgraded. So our sense is that it's going to continue to grow.","I think there's one other point to make here and that's related to the number of legacy rigs, conventional rigs that are still working, that are drilling some of the more \u2013 or at least are drilling horizontal wells. I can't really speak to the complexity. So even in a flattening rig count environment, even if the rig count were to flatten at 900 or 950 or whatever the number may be, you're probably still going to see high grades taking place. I think that would make sense because some of those lower performing rigs are probably going to be displaced.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That makes sense. And before I hand it off, if you wouldn't mind, I know you gave some detail on overall pricing, but could you give us some fresh thoughts on where you're seeing the highest or super-spec rigs getting priced at? The latest that you're seeing, or what you're seeing into the second half of the calendar year?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think it's been \u2013 the highest end on spot pricing is around 19.5 to low-20s, depending on how the rig is set up in terms of the upgrades that we talked about. So that's kind of the range that we've seen as far as today. Does that answer your question? I want to make certain I...","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, we've heard from other folks about into the next several quarters, perhaps seeing even higher rates on deliveries that are scheduled that far out. So I was just wondering if you have anything there.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We don't have anything that I can think of scheduled out that far in the next few quarters. We have ongoing conversations with customers related to rigs and that timing. We don't have any new builds. We do have some discussions related to customers that have several rigs of ours running right now, saying, hey, we need to pick up a rig in August or we may need to pick up a couple or two rigs in the fall. This is the type of rig configuration that we're looking for.","They're doing that to make certain that we're kind of reserving a spot in our schedule. But, again, I wouldn't even put that in the category of a commitment. It's just kind of a discussion. Obviously, you know this; it's just a function of what prices are going to do. And if oil prices remain in the $50 to $55 range, then I would imagine we're getting pretty close to where the rig count's going to kind of flatten out for a period of time. If it goes to $55 to $60, then I think we continue to possibly see some increases in activity.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Matthew Johnston with Nomura Securities International. Your line is now open.","Matthew Johnston - Nomura Securities","Hey, good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Johnston - Nomura Securities","So, Juan Pablo, when you gave the breakdown for the rigs under term contract, I think you mentioned that you had about 30 of them that were priced during the downturn with average duration of less than a year. Just curious if you guys are getting any inquiries from your customers for term contracts of a longer duration? Anyone coming to you and asking to lock the rig up for two years or even longer at this point?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Sure, Matt. I believe we are seeing some requests. But most of our rigs are going to work in the spot market as you've probably noticed in the numbers. But perhaps John may have a little more color on that.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, Matt. There have been a few rigs, Flex3s that have been termed up recently, anywhere from one to two-year type term contracts and low $20,000 type of contracts. So that's positive to see. Of course, the rigs are outfitted with skid systems, 7,500 psi. They're super-spec capable rigs. So that's an encouraging sign to see. And again, we're seeing pricing improvement on the spot market side as well.","Matthew Johnston - Nomura Securities","Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, just connected to that real quick, is it fair to say that all of the term contracts that you are booking at this point you're booking them at a higher price than that spot rate in the high teens?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yes. That is our intention is to \u2013 if we're going to lock up a term contract today, it's going to be at a higher level than spot pricing.","Matthew Johnston - Nomura Securities","Got it. Great. That's it for me, guys. Thanks.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Matt. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Kurt.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. I just wanted to gauge from you, I was kind of little bit on and off here this morning, a lot going on as you're probably aware with a lot of other conference calls and so on. So I apologize if I ask something you guys already answered. The dynamics on pricing, right, as rigs are filtering into the market, kind of getting the sense that there's super-spec rigs are able to get very good pricing and very good margins and let's just say price points in and around the $20,000 a day or maybe better than that. And then if it's not a super-spec rig, the price points are still not really moving very much. So I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about a bifurcation. And if there is a bifurcation and kind of how you see pricing evolving?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, Kurt. This is John. Well, there's no doubt that the super-spec outfitted rigs are commanding higher price. So I think there is a level of bifurcation. We have seen an improvement in our spot pricing on FlexRigs that don't have the upgrades. But, clearly, those rates are not as high as a spot rate for a super-spec rig or, as we just mentioned a moment ago to Matt, related to term contracts, they're not \u2013 in most cases, they're not at that level. So I think it's logical that you would have that.","I had mentioned earlier on the call, I don't know if you were on then, I think there are still \u2013 David, aren't we still seeing around 200 conventional rigs that are drilling horizontal directional wells?","David Hardie - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","That sounds correct.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think that's still generally correct, Kurt. And I'm sure the pricing on those are at a lower level than \u2013 depending on how they're outfitted, than the AC drive rigs. Again, those rigs, I think, are going to come under increasing pressure. I don't even know where all of them are working, but I think just in general, you're going to see more pressure on that legacy fleet.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. I appreciate that color. Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thanks, Kurt.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","James Schumm - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. This is actually Jim Schumm for Michael.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Hi, Jim.","James Schumm - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you could update us on your new walking system. Just curious how the market is going \u2013 the marketing, rather, any issues? And if you'd be willing to share with us what the cost might be of the structure work?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, Jim, the walking rig, the first Flex3 with a walking system, we have a commitment. We've had a couple of commitments over the last month or so and following through for one reason or another. But we do think that we've got a contract for the rig. Again, we're excited about it. We think that it does offer us an opportunity to capture some additional market share in that space where a walking rig \u2013 a competitor's rig that we can compete head-to-head with. So we're encouraged by that.","We have another four or five that we have planned. Most likely, those rigs are going to go to the Northeast. That's kind of what we're seeing in terms of demand for the walking applications. And so, again, we think it's an opportunity for us. We had mentioned on the last call that we're \u2013 in addition to this new walking rig we also added additional 20 Flex3 skid systems. We've got 11 of those 20 that are committed. And so we're pleased that we're continuing to see demand for customers for Flex3 skid systems as well.","James Schumm - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then, just any rough guidance you could share about the cost per rig for the walking systems?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Jim, at this stage, with the prototype in the stage that it is right now, we're trying to get from the kind of prototype stage to getting it to a more manufacturing cadence perspective. We did say and we've been pretty clear that this is more expensive than a Flex3 with a skid system upgrade because of the substructure design and new fabrication on the substructure.","Obviously, when you're doing the level of upgrade that we're doing, we're also doing 7,500 psi, we're also doing other upgrades, and just generally putting the rig into a condition where it's, you could almost classify it as almost like new. So that drives some additional cost and every rig is going to be little bit different. So we will talk more about the cost in the future. But at this stage of the game, with it being the first rig, it really doesn't make sense to talk about the cost of it right now.","And I will say this, from our perspective, it's very attractive when you look at the potential, again, to capture market share with \"like new type rig\" that can enter into the market and be highly competitive related to \u2013 particularly related to returns on invested capital.","James Schumm - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then, you guys just talked about this in terms of the term contract. And I think it was more about the operator appetite for longer-term contracts. I'm curious to hear your views on what your appetite would be for longer-term contracts. Clearly, the numbers you threw out seem to be pretty focused on the spot market. That obviously makes a lot of sense where we are in the cycle. But is there a day rate or a timeframe where you might start adding more term as we go through the year or is this more of a 2018 event or just how you're thinking about that?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, Jim, it's really \u2013 there are a lot of variables in that and having to do with the location, having to do with the amount of investments you're putting in a rig, the customer, there's lots of variables there to enter into a one or two-year term contract on a Flex3 or a Flex5 with $1 million or $2 million investment in an upgrade kit makes a lot of sense.","And so, from our perspective, sure, we'd be interested in doing that. So we have the appetite for it to a certain level. But, again, you have to have the other side of the equation. You have to have the demand pull from the customer. So I think, for those that we've entered into, I think it's a great value for both us and our customer.","James Schumm - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Jim. Thank you.","Operator","We'll next go to Brad Handler with Jefferies & Company. Your line is now open.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. Good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","I guess I'll follow along the same path, but maybe approach it slightly differently. Are you \u2013 it's just I'm not clear. From an upgrade perspective, are you doing that only with some form of contract, some sort of payback in hand, or are you approaching the market a bit more speculatively than that, again, purely on this upgrade to super-spec front?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, Brad, you've probably heard us say before, six months ago or four months ago, if you didn't have the upgrade, the rig wasn't going to work.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","And today, obviously \u2013 maybe it hasn't been so obvious. We've put rigs to work without having the upgrade kit installed, because, when you're putting 30 out \u2013 approximately 30 out a quarter, if you have demand for 35, you can't get to it. So, you put it on later. In some cases, we're getting term, and in other cases, we're doing it in a spot market fashion. We don't have any concerns that that rig is not going to continue to work. So we think it's a great investment. We're definitely getting a return on our investment.","Obviously, we don't have it locked into a year, or two years in some cases. But, again, based upon the performance we have, the track record we have, the rigs are going to work in an environment like we're seeing or even in a softer market. But we're still about 50% hedged on term contracts and, of course, some of those are previous contracts we entered into.","So, to answer your question, we're doing both. We think it's the right thing to do longer term, and we're pleased \u2013 as we made the point in our prepared remarks, we're pleased that we can do that with our existing fleet, with $1 million and $2 million investments as opposed to having to go out and build a new rig.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Right. No, I understand and I appreciate that color. I may have missed this, but just what is your expected CapEx for 2017? Sort of without labeling it... (42:37)","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We're at $350 million.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So that's unchanged. So, you're sort of following \u2013 it sounds like you're sort of following the game plan including these upgrade moves.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Correct, correct. Yeah, I think we prepared ourselves during the course of the year. We made certain that we were not resource constrained. We've got the CapEx; we've got the long lead items on order. It's really no different from our perspective than building new rigs. We're just building new kits and installing them in kind of a lean fashion. So that helps a lot.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Sure, sure. Okay. Moving to a separate question, I guess you took some charges for rig abandonment, and it sounds like there's some more coming, so $40 million total. Can you tell us what rigs that applies to? Just give a little color around that, please.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Brad, this is Juan Pablo. We'd be glad to. It mostly relates to our U.S. Land segment. As you can imagine, it relates to the rigs that we are performing upgrades on. As we go through the upgrades, there are pieces of equipment that previously pertained to the rig that no longer have any use. And as that equipment is being replaced, then we decommission that equipment, and that's what creates the abandonment charge which is included in depreciation.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Oh, I got it. Okay. Glad I asked. I understand that. Okay. And then maybe just a last one \u2013 not exactly sure what I'm after here, but there's increasing talk around drilling automation packages and the like. A couple of different offerings coming from a couple of different parties, some homegrown I suppose, and then others are third-party offerings. I guess I'm curious for \u2013 if I presume that your fleet is equipped to handle those apps, if you will, I guess I'm curious for the appetite you have for that and any color you might be able to offer.","And then, if I may, sort of wrapped within the same question, there is \u2013 wired pipe seems like it's actually hitting the market today. And I guess I'd be curious for if you have had some experience dealing with wired pipe and again, what you see as the future with that?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Sure, Brad. Yeah, the \u2013 and I'm assuming the automation \u2013 I think you said this, it's down-hole. It's automation, trying to limit the human intervention from a driller and from a directional driller. So, yes, we've been involved really for several years in working towards that type of an effort. And so we've seen the other folks that have talked through it.","Number one question that you had is, are our rigs capable? Yes, the rigs are capable. We do have in-house capability on some of the things that we're working on. It's been a bit of iterative process over time, which isn't completely surprising. It's, in some respects, a little similar to, if you think about autonomous vehicles and the different steps that need to be taken along the way to get to more of a full automation, you can imagine there's an advisory mode step in there somewhere.","And so we've said now for quite some time that, yes, there's going to be multiple solutions. H&P will, we believe, will be a part of having a solution. At the same time, we also have to have a platform \u2013 our FlexRigs have to have a platform to accept other solutions, because that's what customers are going to work.","So it's a little bit of a plug-and-play type of an environment where you can come in and plug in other apps. Our operating system and set up that we have has that capability. So we're excited about the future as it relates to that, clearly, I think kind of goes back into that Family of Solutions that we've talked about and applying technology to provide a fleet that's going to perform well in the future.","As far as wired drill pipe, wired drill pipe has been around for a long time. We have had wired drill pipe on our rigs. I couldn't tell you if it's happened three times or a dozen times in the last year, but we do have \u2013 we have had exposure to wired drill pipe. Obviously, NOV is a big player in that space and we've worked with NOV for many, many years. So I think we'll continue to see opportunities to work with companies like NOV to develop that kind of technology going forward.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful just to touch on that. Okay, great. Thank you. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Brad. Thank you.","Operator","","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Aaron, this is Juan Pablo, given that there are no other questions, John would like to make a few concluding comments.","John W.

The speakers today will be John Lindsay, President and CEO; and me, Juan Pablo Tardio. Also with us today is Dave Hardie, Manager of Investor Relations.","As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call this morning.","At the time of our last call in July, the industry rig count was nearing the low levels reached during the 2009 recession and we were witnessing a second round of declining oil prices and increased volatility. The question on everyone's mind then was are things going to get worse from here. We know that the fundamentals had continued to deteriorate. And today, U.S. land drilling activity is at the lowest level since January of 2003.","For many, the major theme across the industry is survival. Service pricing continues to decline and this has led to sharp reductions in personnel, expenses and investments across the board. While no company is immune to these conditions, fortunately, a cornerstone of our strategy has always been physical conservatism. Our strong balance sheet and long-term contract coverage continues to serve us well. We also believe our advanced rig fleet, strong customer base, and best-in-class reputation for customer service and value creation position us very well in this difficult environment.","In many respects, this downturn has been indiscriminate of rig quality as evidenced by the number of Tier 1 rigs on the sideline. Even with some of the best rigs idle, there is still evidence that replacement cycle is ongoing. A year ago, approximately 41% of the active rigs were AC drive. And today, approximately 58% of the active rigs in the U.S. are AC drive rigs, with the remaining 42% of the active rigs made up of a legacy fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs that continue to be less relevant as the cycle wears on.","H&P's fleet profile is a competitive advantage as it allows the company to provide a family of solutions for customers. We provide FlexRigs that are suited for a wide range of well configurations and well complexities for customers today.","Perhaps more importantly, we believe our fleet provides what customers will need in the future. We have over 340 AC drive rigs in the U.S. market, including more than 310 FlexRigs rated at 1,500 horsepower, the optimal horsepower for the more difficult and complex horizontal extended reach laterals being drilled today.","Over 180 FlexRigs are capable for multi-well locations and many of those rigs have additional capability, like 7,500 psi pump systems. Our ability to design and build means that any FlexRigs in our fleet is a candidate for an upgrade to meet the customers' needs.","We have a long history of innovating during down cycles and having customers reward those efforts as conditions improve. That commitment to design and innovation continues to be a focus in this difficult downturn.","Another competitive advantage is the organizational infrastructure that we have built over the past 10 years. This infrastructure allows us to leverage the learnings we capture from the fleet, and to partner with customers to provide greater efficiencies, reliability and safety, all aimed at drilling the lowest cost well for that customer and maximizing the number of wells they can deliver in a budget year.","We've extended these advantages to international markets and we'll continue to push to expand our footprint. In short, we believe that our people, our fleet profile, and our systems are unmatched in the industry.","To summarize, we are in the midst of a very challenging market. Our efforts will remain focused on adding shareholder value by prudently allocating capital to provide innovative solutions that help our customers reduce their total cost and be more competitive in the global market.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, John. The company reported $422 million in net income for fiscal 2015 compared to $709 million for fiscal 2014. The average annual level of drilling activity for the company declined by over 20%, but the decline is closer to 50% when we compare this fourth fiscal quarter, for fiscal 2015 that is, with last year's fourth fiscal quarter. This, of course, is the result of a market environment that, as John mentioned, presents serious challenges in terms of generating earnings for our shareholders as reflected in our fourth fiscal quarter results.","Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $64 million in segment operating income during the fourth fiscal quarter, excluding abandonment charges related to old SCR rigs. The number of quarterly revenue days declined by a little over 5% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of approximately 147 rigs generating revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter. On average, approximately 118 of these rigs were under term contracts and approximately 29 rigs worked in the spot market.","Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day slightly decreased to $26,218 in the fourth fiscal quarter, and the average rig expense per day decreased to $13,823, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $12,395 in the fourth fiscal quarter. The decline in average rig revenue per day was again attributable to softer market conditions. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was primarily a result of a reducing volume of rigs becoming idle and requiring attention as compared to the prior quarter.","During the quarter, the segment generated approximately $33 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contract. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate about $13 million during the first fiscal quarter, about $45 million during the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2016, and over $10 million thereafter in early termination revenues.","Since November of last year and excluding some rigs working for customers that decided not to early terminate the contract after prior written notice to us, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 60 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment.","Total early termination revenues related to these 60 contracts are now estimated at over $270 million, approximately $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow previously expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $123 million during fiscal 2016, and $62 million after that.","As of today, our 344 available rigs in the U.S. land segment includes approximately 132 rigs generating revenue and 212 idle rigs. Included in the 132 rigs generating revenue are 108 rigs under term contracts, 104 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 24 rigs are currently active in the spot market for a total of 128 rigs generating revenue days in the segment.","Some rigs that generate revenue days are on standby type day rates. Rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include four newbuild rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.","Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to decrease by about 11% to 14% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to slightly decline to roughly $26,000. The average rig expense per day level is expected to also decline to roughly $13,600.","Subject to additional early terminations and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, the segment already has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 107 rigs during the first fiscal quarter, let me repeat that, 107 rigs during the first fiscal quarter and an average of about 102 rigs and 77 rigs during all of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, respectively.","Some of the mutually beneficial negotiations of long-term contracts that resulted in reduced day rates in exchange for additional term durations at fully-priced levels have now transitioned back to those fully-priced levels. As a result, the average pricing for rigs that are already under term contracts is expected to slightly increase and remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and newbuilds are deployed.","The average pricing for H&P rigs in the spot market declined by approximately 5% from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and is expected to continue to at least slightly decline during the first fiscal quarter. Average spot pricing today is over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak last November.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $12 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days slightly increased, but the average rig margin per day declined from $14,265 to $13,296 per day during the fourth fiscal quarter.","As we look at the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue days to be relatively flat and the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $9,500 during the quarter. The expected average rig margin decline is primarily attributable to most rigs not performing operations and simply generating relatively low margins under standby-type day rates.","Management contracts on platform rigs continued to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately $7 million. But that is now expected to decline to approximately $3 million during the following quarters, given that customers suspended a couple of projects.","Moving on to our international land operations, the segment experienced a significant operating loss of $38 million during the fourth fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of non-cash impairment charges of approximately $39 million related to several conventional land grades and approximately $5 million in charges related to an allowance for doubtful accounts associated with customers that we are no longer working for. These charges were partly offset by early contract termination compensation of approximately $9 million during the quarter.","Excluding the impact of $4,658 per day and $5,535 per day corresponding to early contract termination compensation during the third and fourth quarters, respectively, as well as the impact of $3,021 per day corresponding to charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth fiscal quarter, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $13,086 to $7,856 per day.","The decline as expected was influenced by expenses corresponding to several rigs that became idle and to two rigs that were demobilized out of Tunisia. The decline was also attributable to day rate adjustments for two active rigs that rolled off long-term contracts.","Revenue days sequentially decreased by approximately 12% to an average of about 18 active rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 16 active rigs including 11 in Argentina, 2 in the UAE, 1 in Colombia, 1 in Ecuador and 1 in Bahrain. 14 of the 16 active rigs are under long-term contracts. 22 rigs are idle, including 8 in Argentina, 7 in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador and 2 in Bahrain.","We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be down with an average of approximately 15 rigs active during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The average rig margin per day is expected to slightly increase to close to $8,000 per day and no early termination revenues are expected during the first fiscal quarter in the segment.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our liquidity position remains very strong and we expect no change to our regular dividend dollar per share levels in the foreseeable future. We reported capital expenditures of slightly over $1.1 billion for fiscal 2015 well below our $1.3 billion estimate for the year.","Although almost half of the reductions relate to timing differences of spending that moved to fiscal 2016, we were pleased to see the effect of several capital preservation initiatives result in reduced spending during fiscal 2015. Including the spending that moved from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million.","Roughly 70% to 80% of the spending estimate includes the remaining commitments related to our newbuild program and other special projects mostly related to the further enhancement of our existing fleet. The remaining 20% to 30% of the spending estimate is related to maintenance CapEx and other miscellaneous items.","Our FlexRig construction cadence plan remains generally the same, with 6 new FlexRigs to be completed between now and the end of March of 2016. As has been the case, with over 330 new AC drive FlexRigs on average over the last decade or so, every new rig that we are scheduled to complete is sponsored with a three-year term contract that is expected to generate an after tax payback of close to 90% during the duration of the contracted term.","Including these remaining contracts and combining all three of our drilling segments, we have an average of 118 rigs under term contracts to be active in fiscal 2016, 93 in fiscal 2017, and 52 in fiscal 2018. Given the soft market conditions and the mentioned early termination of long-term contracts, our backlog decreased from approximately $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2015 to approximately $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015.","We expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. Interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to be approximately $25 million for fiscal 2016.","The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 36.6%, which was higher than originally expected as a result of adjustments mostly related to foreign taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be approximately 36%.","Our non-current deferred income tax liability as of September 30, 2015 was slightly under $1.3 billion, which is lower than previously expected, as a result of non-cash adjustments related to abandonment and impairment charges and to the lower market pricing of our holdings of investment securities. We expect this liability level to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during the next couple of years.","With that, let me turn the call back to John.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Juan Pablo. And before opening the call to questions, I want to reemphasize our 2015 fiscal year has been a very challenging year, but even the most difficult of market conditions will provide opportunities. As the industry's high grade process moves forward, our ability to respond with the right rig, the best people, and in a timely and efficient manner will position the company for more opportunities and will ultimately allow us to provide greater value to customers.","Finally, I want to thank our employees and management teams for stepping up to the challenges that we have faced, embracing change in a positive way, and responding in a remarkable fashion. We aren't finished with the work at hand. In fact, we won't ever be finished. It is a long march, and I truly appreciate everyone for contributing to the efforts.","And Tanisha, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks. Your margins are actually holding in quite nicely. The one thing I wanted to ask about is in the spot market where there just seems to be a lot of confusion on where rigs are being priced. But if I'm doing the math correctly, you did 25 rigs that you have in the spot market. Is it correct that they're working at just under $20,000 a day?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Dan, this is Juan Pablo. I think that's a fair assumption.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And just so I understand...","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","High teens in general would be our description.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. So despite these tough market conditions, you're actually still able to reprice in this current market at that rate. Correct?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Dan, this is John. That's where our spot market pricing has been averaging. But clearly, as this market has moved forward, I mean, they are higher \u2013 high teens, but they're in a range, $17,000 to $18,000. I mean, it's job-specific, area-specific. But clearly, with oil pricing and the range that it's been, there's not any \u2013 number one, there's not much of a spot market out there to compete in, but that's kind of the average pricing that we've been seeing.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks. And can you just give us some \u2013 you still have a number of rigs on term contracts internationally and I believe a bunch of those are in Argentina where you had some nice contract awards, I think, about a year ago. Can you just give us some color on the roll-off schedule over the next fiscal year and how margins might progress? Because I believe those contracts were also at pretty attractive margins?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I will mention that the Argentina contracts were \u2013 those 10 rigs were five-year term contracts. I think Juan Pablo has more details on the overall international fleet.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Dan, if you take a look at the next four years for international and determine what is the average number of rigs that we already have under term contract for those following years, the numbers would be respectively beginning from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2019, 14 rigs, 13.2 rigs, 11.8 rigs, and 10 rigs. Of course, as John mentioned, the base of that represents the rigs that we have active in Argentina.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Thanks. And then just last one, just how low are you willing to take the cash balance to maintain the current dividend?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Dan, this is Juan Paulo. We fortunately don't have to be worried about that at this point. As you can see, our level of liquidity is very high. We would prefer to have a high level of liquidity over downturns, as we've mentioned in the past. We will just continue to monitor the cycle and make decisions as we go. But at this point, as we've said, we do believe that we are in position to sustain the current dividend levels.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","My back of the envelope math points to somewhere around $150 million in CapEx associated with upgrades. Is that in the ballpark?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","This is Juan Pablo. Scott, we're not providing that level of detail. I think that we provided a broad range of $300 million to $400 million. A lot of that will be determined by market conditions and opportunities as they emerge. So a lot of moving parts and we can't you give a specific number on that.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's fair. Is the upgrade portion, though, a primary driver of the delta between the low end and the high end?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Scott, this is John. There is a portion of that, there is also a portion related to just maintenance CapEx in general. As Juan Pablo said, there is a wide range of potential outcomes in terms of activity for 2016. And so that's the reason for the broad range in the CapEx.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And how much of the planned upgrade spending is on active rigs versus idle rigs?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, that's a hard one to nail. Obviously, that's going to be a function of the type of environment that we see. I mean, the fact is we have very capable rigs that are sidelined right now that don't require any sort of an upgrade. But again, there's 7,500 psi, there's third mud pump. There's just other upgrade opportunities that we have as customers begin to exploit some of these unconventional resources maybe in a little bit different way.","So not a lot more color we can add to that, but it would probably be a little bit of an all of the above. I think we would probably have some upgrades for the rigs that were working, and then assuming that we were able to continue to take market share going forward, it would also be some rigs that would be coming out of idle condition.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And one last one. Earlier in the year, you're performing some maintenance on the idle rigs in order to keep them ready for reactivation and this was leading to a bit of a rise in your daily OpEx. You guided for $13,600, which is down quarter-on-quarter. What are you seeing with this strategy in terms of spending some money to keep the rigs ready to try to take some share as when we see an inflection in demand?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, your description of maintaining, I mean it was \u2013 mostly, it was a preservation. I think historically, the industry hasn't done a great job related to when you idle a rig in performing some of the preservation that needs to happen and actually idling the rig in the proper fashion in a lot of cases because, a lot of the expectation would be, will the rigs going to go to work in the next month or so? So there is some additional cost upfront on that.","Clearly, there's some ongoing cost associated. Some of it is a fixed cost that we really don't have much control over. That's most of the cost that you see today. I think we're in a really good position with the fleet status, and that we're ready to go back to work at a moment's notice and we could put rigs back to work very quickly and, I think, at a fairly, fairly low cost.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Appreciate the color.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, Scott. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. If I heard you correctly, there's about 128 rigs that's generating revenue days currently?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In the U.S. land segment, yes, Waqar.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In the U.S. land segment, yeah. Okay. And you're guiding to about 126 rigs for the fourth \u2013 for the December quarter. So, the exit rate in the December quarter, you think is, what, 124 rigs, 125 rigs, in that kind of range?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure what your assumption was to come up with 126 rigs. We provided a wide range of 11% to 14% decline. You may have taken the highest number there. I'm not sure how you got to that number. But, I think in general terms, it's probably fair to assume that the number of rigs that we have active or generating revenue days, as you described it, 128 rigs, that's probably going to be flat to slightly down through the remainder of the quarter.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's good. That's interesting. Now, we hear a lot about industry just dropping rigs post-Thanksgiving and then sharp decline in the December timeframe. You'd certainly get the first indication of the plans. Do you hear \u2013 what are your clients telling you about post-Thanksgiving activity for them?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Waqar, this is John. We don't have that indication. I've heard and read some of the same that you've described. At this stage, we're not getting that indicator from our customer base. We have been successful on putting a few rigs to work. Our hope is that we could continue to put a couple of rigs to work during the rest of the quarter. But I think in general, what Juan Pablo said is right on track. It's rig count flat to slightly down. But we don't see a dramatic reduction, based on what we've heard right now, in our rig count.","I do, however, think that there are continuing to be other rigs that are in the industry that are on term contracts that are rolling off, and so that could have an impact. I think there's also, obviously, this possibility of customers just running out of budget dollars due to the low oil price environment.","So we've heard some of the same thing. Fortunately, we don't see it with our customers at this stage, but I know that's definitely a possibility.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then is this still too early or what are you hearing from your customers regarding the March quarter or first calendar year quarter what the plans are? Do you expect the rig count to bottom around December and then start picking up in the March quarter? You think the bottom is more like, need to be some times in the first quarter or second quarters?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We sure don't have a good feel on that other than, again, just talking with our customers. Again, it's too early to call right now, but our hope would be is that we would at least be able to maintain our activity set that we have today going into at least the first part of the first calendar quarter of 2016. But, of course, that's not what we're hearing. We're hearing that overall, the rig count, a lot of folks are expecting it to continue to decline.","And again back on the point I made earlier, we know there are rigs that are going to continue to roll off of term contracts in the industry and our sense is that rollover rate seems to be gaining a little bit of steam. So, it's hard to say. I mean, we don't know the answer to it. We sure don't see any indicators that it's going to bottom out and then respond and start going back in the other direction at this point, not at $42, $43, or $45 oil pricing.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And you mentioned that a subset of your rigs, AC rigs, have 1,500 horsepower and 7,500 psi equipment. What is that number and what is the utilization of that fleet or otherwise how many such rigs are idle right now?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Off the top of my head, I don't know if you have...","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I'm not sure if I followed your question, but let me give it a try in terms of answering at least part of it. We have over 180 rigs in the U.S. land segment that are pad capable, and about 88 of those are active or contracted. So that represents close to a 50% utilization. As it relates to rigs equipped with 7,500 psi systems, several of those, or a good number of those, do have those systems. I can't give you a number right now. I don't have that.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Does that answer your question, Waqar?","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. No, I was interested in the utilization of such rigs that have 7,500 psi systems on them.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We have \u2013 I think there's a few 7,500 psi systems on rigs that are idle. I think the majority of the 7,500 systems are active today. And we continue to high grade rigs to 7,500 psi systems where needed. I mean, the fact is not all basins need 7,500. Not all customers within the same basin require 7,500. It's a little bit of a mixed bag.","But as I've described in my comments, that's one of the significant advantages that we have is this ability to add upgrade kits, if you will, to FlexRigs, both rigs that are working as well as rigs that are idle that could respond to needs. I mean, we're still seeing examples of high grading where we're putting rigs to work for customers and that rig is high grading or replacing a competitor's older rig or underperforming rig. So that continues to be an opportunity for us.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In your international business, you guided to about $8,000 a day margin. I suspect some of that margin decline has to do with extra cost that you're carrying as you maybe stack some equipment. Can we go back to kind of more normal kind of margins even if the rig count doesn't go up internationally, and when can that happen, and what is that kind of nominal kind of margin?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Waqar, this is Juan Pablo. Yeah. You make a good point. When you have that number of idled rigs, it does represent a burden, but in addition to that, we're down to, I believe, five countries where we're active and three of those only have one rig that is active. And the basic cost of maintaining an operation in a particular country is something that does impact the average rig revenue and average rig expense \u2013 pardon me, the average rig expense per day, not the rig revenue per day and, of course, the margin per day.","So having a significant impact on that, while we can't spread those fixed costs, so to speak, among a larger number of rigs, is challenging. We are certainly looking at ways to try to be more cost effective internationally as you can imagine.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So is $8,000 a day margin, is that a good run rate then or where can we go up to like \u2013 or is it still there's potential to still come down as we go into the March and June quarters?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, as always, Waqar, that will depend on market conditions. If market conditions remain the same, I think that is a fair assumption. But as we know, we are in very volatile times and, hopefully, we'll have much better news in the following quarters if we see a recovery. But it's tough to tell at this point.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Waqar, we're obviously spending a lot of time and effort on this and, as Juan Pablo just said, we'll have more to report and we'll be more clear here in the coming month or so into the next quarter.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then just one last quick question. Do you expect working capital to be a source of funds going forward as well in the next, let's say, next fiscal year as well like it's been this year?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It certainly has been a very significant source of funds over the downturn. Going forward, it all depends on what happens in the market. It's going to be interesting to see that. But nonetheless, we don't expect that to be a driver in terms of liquidity for us and our ability to remain very strong in that regard going forward. And, of course, as we mentioned before, the ability of the company to sustain the dividend, we believe, is very strong at least for the foreseeable future.","Waqar Mustafa Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Waqar.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we can go ahead and take our next question from Rob MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Thank you. John, I wanted to come back to some of your prepared remarks on \u2013 and good at that on your historical propensity to innovate during cyclical downturns and being rewarded for that. Your CapEx budget doesn't seem to include anything along those lines for this quarter. Can you give us some idea as to what you're thinking about and where that might take H&P?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Rob, it's really \u2013 it's an ongoing effort at the company and it's a big part of our culture. We continue to work on a lot of things, most of which we're not going to go into any great detail and talk about it. But I can tell you, there's a lot of things related to the organization, related to rig, equipment and upgrades and just generally working on continuing this value proposition for customers.","So we're obviously working with customers on various things and trying to figure out how we're going to continue to provide the greatest performance possible in the safest way possible for our customers. So we obviously are spending a lot of time and effort on that.","If you think about what has really driven our CapEx over time is when we're building a lot of newbuilds. And, of course, last year we've built \u2013 we were building four rigs per month. And so that was really what drove that initial, what, $1.3 billion CapEx. So you shouldn't see that CapEx range being something that's messaging that we're not investing in the business and we're not innovating.","Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Great. Thank you. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. So, Juan Pablo and John, I think you mentioned at the early part of your remarks that the AC drive now accounts for 58% of active rigs. And given how much the rates for Tier 1 rigs have come down, AC drive rigs have come down, and I'm sure that the differential \u2013 pricing differential with Tier 2, 3 and 4 rigs has narrowed very substantially. It's a little surprising that there's really still some lower tier rigs in the market. And I just wonder from your perspective kind of what would account for that since \u2013 or am I correct that the pricing differential has narrowed significantly from a year ago?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, Robin, I think your sense is right. There's no doubt that the pricing differential has narrowed. I think a portion of the legacy fleet that's working, of course, we don't have any rigs in that category, so we don't know the contractual situation. But our assumption is there's a portion of those rigs that are under term contract. And so I think, over time, we can probably expect to see some of those rigs roll off. And so I think our expectation would be, going forward, is you're going to continue to see the legacy fleet being replaced by AC drive rigs and, obviously, our vote would be FlexRigs. And we're going to see that happen over time.","You've heard us say this over and over for several years and that is these rigs are working harder than they ever have; they're delivering at a higher level of performance than rigs ever have, the cycle times are increasing dramatically. And that puts a lot of pressure on that older legacy fleet design. And so, again, I think, over time, that'll happen.","The question will be: what about the pricing? But we've heard this for years. You can't reduce the day rate low enough on that older legacy fleet, in many cases, to be able to save money for the customer. I mean, at the end of the day, it ends up costing the customer to go with that older rig fleet. So I think, over time, we're going to continue to see the replacement cycle play out kind of like what we've described. And if you look back over the last five years, you can see it happening.","Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. I'd agree. Okay. Thank you. So just one other question, and this relates to Juan Pablo's mention that there are a few cases where you have agreed to lower the day rate on a term contract in exchange for an extension of the contract, sort of like the blend-and-extend deals we hear more frequently on offshore contractors. But then I thought I heard you say that some of those deals then reverted back to the original contract. And, I guess, my question is, is that kind of deal common because it seems that by far the majority of cases were the E&P companies just want to buy out the remaining term of the contract.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think \u2013 Robin, let me make a couple of comments and John may wish to add to that, of course. But what you referred to as blend-and-extend type contracts, what that typically implies is that the contractor reduces the day rate or the pricing in exchange of increasing the duration of the contract. That is not the case in terms of what we refer to. What happens in the type of deals that we refer to is that there is a period of time for which a customer can get a slightly lower day rate. But then after that, the day rate goes back to the original day rate contemplated in the contract, and the duration once again begins to take into account. In other words, if you have a two-year term remaining or two years out of three years remaining and you have a six-month period where you have lower day rates, then the two years that remain move to the right.","And once you get to the point where a customer is ready to go back to a higher day rate \u2013 which is in a short period \u2013 in the short term in general, then the day rate goes back to the original price, at the higher price. So we thought that that was a mutually beneficial type of arrangement. It's not necessarily very common, but we do all that we can to work with our customers.","Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. I see. Okay. Well, thanks for clarifying that.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, sir.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Robin, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Hey, good morning.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So I was just real curious about when you look forward into next year, difficult market conditions, et cetera. How do you think about the dynamic? Will you be able to fund CapEx and dividends and basically come out in a cash breakeven position, free cash breakeven position in 2016, or is your gating factor CapEx, if you kind of see what I'm saying?","Are you going to reduce CapEx to maintain a positive free cash flow position, or are you going to need to tap a debt market or whatever to keep paying out your dividend? How are you guys thinking about that tactically?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Kurt, this is Juan Pablo. I guess the last part of your question, I'd like to address first. We would not expect to borrow money in order to pay dividends. If we were to borrow money in the future, it probably would be to pursue opportunities or expand the business. It would probably be business-related.","But to the first part of your question, the amount of cash flow that we will be able to generate will depend on market conditions. And of course, we don't provide guidance in that regard. So, we can't provide you a reference there. What we do have, of course, is a significant number of long-term contracts that ensure that we will get a very strong base in terms of cash from operations. And then from that, we think that we'll be able to fund the CapEx level that we commented on and the current dividend level.","We also have, of course, as you know, a very high level of cash and liquidity. In general, if there were to be a negative cash flow position in any of the following years, we would certainly look at that existing cash at the beginning of the year to fund whatever may be pending or may be the difference there. So, hopefully, that helps to answer your question.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Yes. That's very helpful. Now, listening to the entire commentary and having a variety of discussions, you are heading into this fourth quarter period, it's still not quite clear to me whether or not there is going to be or continue to be incremental pricing pressures above and beyond what we've seen? And just wondering if you might have some general perspectives on that and maybe provide a little bit of color to where there is no color right now.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Kurt, this is John. I said earlier there really isn't much of a spot market out there. So, there is not a lot of active bidding for work. I think generally that's when you see a lot of pressure on pricing per se. I don't get the sense that operators, at least, our customers in general, there's not this continual request for a reduction in day rate because I think, number one, because we're working together very well. We're delivering a lot of value. The cost of their wells continue to come down. I mean, you just look across the board in the E&P space, and that's a pretty common theme that well costs are coming down.","So, I just think it's not something that's out there being talked about because we're really not out there bidding much in the spot market. I don't have \u2013 I don't get a sense that there's going to be this huge push to continue to reduce pricing, but that \u2013 we're making an assumption that the market looks like it is now and that oil prices are in the $40 range. And if something crazy doesn't happen and prices go lower, I'm not expecting that, but in that event, maybe you would see some additional pricing pressure. But that's about as clear as we can make it right now, Kurt. We just really don't have any more visibility on that based on what we see right now.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. And if I may kind of sneak one follow-up in the comment you mentioned about some newbuilds. Now, I wasn't quite clear on whether those newbuild deliveries were being canceled or were putting on hold as your potential customers are deciding when they're going to be ready to take those new rigs. Can you help clarify that for me?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Kurt. In some cases, over the last several months, we have had some customers that have requested a delay in terms of the delivery of the newbuild in exchange for compensation to H&P. And again, we try to work with the customers as best we can and we've accommodated in a few cases and I think those are the four newbuilds that we made a comment on that you're probably making reference to.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So they're not cancellations, they're just delays in delivery?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me \u2013 I think we have time for one more question please, operator.","Operator","Okay. Perfect. We'll go ahead and take our last question from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Byron.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Byron.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","John, you touched on the indiscriminate laying down of rigs irrespective of rig quality and we've certainly seen an overall rig count. Your Flex5s have held up remarkably well from a utilization point of view. My gut would suggest that part of that is a function of when newbuilds came onto long-term contracts. But I was just wondering if you could comment on that.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, no, that's exactly right, Byron. I mean, they are a great rig and the reality is most of the Flex5s had a \u2013 they have a large amount of term contract remaining on that, so the early termination fee is significantly higher. You look at the Flex3s, we've been building new Flex3s, but the majority of the Flex3s that were on term contract, a lot of them weren't still on their original newbuild term contract, if that makes sense.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Sure. Okay. And then second quick question. It's \u2013 despite the decimation to the overall U.S. land rig count, you guys still have the most rigs working in two key areas, the Eagle Ford and the Permian. So could you speak to, at a high level, what you're seeing in terms of footage per day, just trying to think through the order of magnitude of drilling efficiencies that we still might be seeing?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's a great question, Byron. As we look back all the way to 2010-2011, we've had double-digit improvements in productivity footage per day year-over-year, maybe with one exception, and that was going from 2013 to 2014, I think, because of the level of activity that the industry experienced. But we're obviously seeing a lot of performance improvement this year.","Obviously, you would expect that with having all of your people \u2013 you have a lot of experience on rigs. But we're continuing to see 15% to 20% performance improvement year-over-year in 2015 versus 2014. And when you, like I said earlier, these rigs are performing at the highest levels ever. There is still some opportunities ahead, but clearly, when you start looking at, as an example, a 7- or an 8-day well compared to a 25-day well, the opportunity set obviously gets a little smaller every year.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Sure. Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thanks, Byron.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And before we finish the call, we have a couple more comments to make, please.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I just wanted to thank you all again. I want to leave you with one last thought and that is, we continue to work very hard to improve the capabilities of the company. HP has a solid track record of coming out of these downturns as a stronger company. Our management team has experienced many downturns.

[Operator Instructions] And please note today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO of Helmerich & Payne.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO; and John Lindsay, Executive Vice President and COO. As usual and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment's operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to Hans Helmerich.","Hans C. Helmerich","Thank you, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report the company achieved an all-time record level of quarterly income from continuing operations. This is a nice milestone made possible by, literally, thousands of H&P employees who work hard every day to exceed our customers' expectations. We have discussed on a number of these calls the impressive rotation from dry gas direct drilling to oil and NGL directed targets. There's been a steady 3-year upward march in oil directed drilling that had been more than enough to offset a slowly deteriorating dry gas drilling rig count. Then, a couple things happened earlier this year. Natural gas prices plunged beneath $2 per mcf and the gas directed rig count dropped by over 1\/3, reaching a 13-year low. Next, the oil rig count received a jolt at the time of our last call. WTI prices were over $105, but by the end of the quarter, the oil prices had fallen to $77 and changed. While both oil and gas prices have recovered some lately, the $100 question focuses on what happens next, particularly to the future price of oil. Certainly, that answers entangled with macroeconomic headlines of the euro crisis, the ongoing Middle East turmoil and the sense for a slowing world economy, but the volatility and uncertainty is weighing on the minds of our customers and impacting their spending in the field. I think the right question to ask at the onset of what appears to be a somewhat softening cycle is how deep and will the pain go and how long will it last. While our sense is that the duration and the depth of this slowdown will be on the milder side, I can't think of a time in the company's history that we've been better positioned for the uncertainty ahead. In addition to our quality fleet profile and strong balance sheet, we've never had a more robust term contract coverage. Today, 157 FlexRigs or about 2\/3 of our active fleet are under long-term contracts in the U.S. land market. Moreover, we already have in place today an average of 136 FlexRigs under term contract during fiscal 2013 and still an average of 95 FlexRigs under term contracts during fiscal 2014. These rigs are expected to generate average daily rig margins that are higher than the average reported in the segment during this third fiscal quarter. In addition, today, we have 13 rigs under term contracts internationally, as well as 2 platform rigs. Most of these 15 rigs are already contracted through fiscal 2014.","Turning to our new build effort. We continue to make deliveries on time and on budget, including 11 new FlexRigs since our last webcast. We have 25 rigs that remain under construction that will roll off at a pace of 4 per month. As we mentioned on the last call, the ongoing rig rotation in the oil patch represents a kind of competition for new build orders as customers have taken a wait-and-see approach in terms of what rigs may become available. The added volatility and uncertainty we are discussing today has further quieted conversations at least at this point, and this is not a big surprise. Our experience reminds us that this also can turn around very quickly. In the meantime, our ongoing construction effort buys us some time. We suspect that the entire land industry is dialing back on new builds, resulting in around 150 AC drive rig deliveries for 2012. It's too early to predict 2013 except to say that the number of industry deliveries will be significantly less. Our own expectations after our last scheduled delivery in February 2013 are for things to start slowing but find traction as the year progresses. Our integrated effort affords us an important flexibility that should serve us well.","Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, you may have seen where we repurchased 1.75 million shares of stock during the last quarter at an average price of $44.40 per share. We believe the implied market value of the fleet at those levels makes it an attractive option. As we go forward, our preference would be to focus on building iron and what we believe is an ongoing replacement cycle. At the same time, we'll try to find the right balance in managing our expectation for future excess cash flow in a manner that maximizes shareholder value by returning funds through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.","At this point, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Hans. Our record result during the third fiscal quarter were primarily attributable to our U.S. Land segment, where we experienced continued improvements in average pricing and activity levels along with better-than-expected daily rig expenses. At this point, however, and given the mentioned uncertainty around current market conditions, we are not expecting additional growth in income from continuing operations during the fourth fiscal quarter.","Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and total depreciation for the year is expected to be slightly under our prior estimate of $380 million.","Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year remains at $110 million, and our interest expense estimate, which is net of capitalized interest, remains at $10 million during fiscal 2012.","Our income tax rate for continuing operations for the first 9 months of the fiscal year and for the third fiscal quarter were at 36.2% and 35.1%, respectively. We expect the tax rate for the fourth fiscal quarter to be between 36% and 37%. The slightly lower effective rate for the third fiscal quarter was due to an increased level of operations in states with lower tax rates and an increase in a tax benefit due to revised annual income estimates.","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight the third fiscal 2012 results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, Offshore and International Land, as well as the outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter of '12.","Beginning with our U.S. Land segment, third fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2.5% to 21,977 days, representing 241 average active rigs in the third quarter as the U.S. Land segment took delivery of 11 of the 13 new build FlexRigs completed during the quarter. The other 2 FlexRigs were mobilized to the Middle East, and I will update further in the International segment. In U.S. Land, an average of 160 rigs were under term contracts, an average of 81 rigs were in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $471 from the second to the third quarter to $28,096 a day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $140 a day, and average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the third fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Average rig expense per day decreased $489 sequentially to $13,337 per day after experiencing higher-than-expected daily cost levels during the first part of the quarter even in the midst of an ongoing cost management efforts. We were pleased to see favorable results during the latter portion of the quarter. There were no significant onetime adjustments in our U.S. operating cost. Average rig margin per day increased by $960 sequentially to $14,759 a day. As a result, U.S. Land operating income increased 12% to $236 million. As of today, the company's U.S. Land segment leads the industry in active rigs with 241 contracted rigs and 38 idle rigs. The 241 contracted rigs include 157 under term contracts and 84 operating in the spot market. Of the 84 rigs in the spot market, 82 are FlexRigs. Only 2 of the 84 rigs in the spot market are drilling wells targeting dry gas. Also, we estimate 15 of the 157 rigs under term contracts are drilling wells targeting dry gas, but none of these 15 rigs roll off of their term contracts during the remainder of this fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter U.S. Land activity outlook begins with the scheduled construction and delivery of 4 new FlexRigs per month. Overall activity outlook is dependent upon the direction of oil and gas prices and their impact on the drilling market. The number of revenue days for our U.S. Land segment may increase or decrease by a few percentage points during the fourth quarter as compared to the third fiscal quarter. We would expect a slight increase in quarter-to-quarter average activity and revenue days if the drilling market stabilizes, but would expect a 1% to 2% decline if the market continues to deteriorate. In response to softening oil prices, several of our customers have taken an even more disciplined approach to their budgets and are using this opportunity to trim their active rig counts. In some cases, operators are high grading their existing fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs, providing an opportunity for AC drive FlexRigs to gain market share. However, as a consequence of this high-grading trend, we stacked several SCR rigs, which include Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs. With regard to that rigs working on term contracts, we expect to have at least 162 rigs working on term contracts in the fourth fiscal quarter of '12 and 153 rigs working on term contracts for the first quarter of fiscal '13 and an average of 131 rigs working on term for the remainder of fiscal '13. Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we're going to expect revenue per day for our rigs on term contracts to increase by approximately $150 a day on average in the fourth quarter of '12 and by approximately $400 per day in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are as compared to the third fiscal quarter average. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the fourth quarter to remain roughly flat due to spot market pricing softening and term pricing continuing to increase. At this point, we expect early termination fees to be in the $7 million range during the fourth fiscal quarter. We expect average rig expense per day for the U.S. Land fleet to be in a range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. This range of expense levels take in to account seasonality and market conditions, as described earlier.","Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget, including the 3 new builds announced on May 21. 25 FlexRigs remain under construction are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through the end of the calendar year '12 and 4 rigs are scheduled to deliver in 2013.","Since January of 2006, H&P has built a total of 221 AC drive new build FlexRigs3s, 4s and Flex 5s. Our rig construction, safety and operational expertise have allowed us to capture over 40% of the industry AC drive market share in the U.S. The industry AC drive market share has doubled since the 2008 peak rig count to 30% market share today. SCR and mechanical rigs have lost market share during this replacement cycle and the long-term metrics point to that trend continuing.","Now a review of our Offshore segment, third -- for the third fiscal quarter, where Offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.1 million to $7.7 million. And the outlook for our Offshore segment as of today, the Offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs stacked, although one of the stacked rigs is expected to mobilize in the fourth fiscal quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect Offshore revenue days to increase by 10% to 15% and margin per day to increase by 15% to 20%, as one recently mobilized rig goes to a full operating rate in August and an additional rig begins mobilizing in August as well.","The International Land segment, the results from the second fiscal quarter to the third fiscal quarter increased by approximately $7.2 million. The primary factors driving the increase were activity and margins, revenue days increase 5% to 1,852 days, average rig margin per day increased $2,820 to $7,704 per day. Included in this average, rig margin per day is approximately $800 per day of net positive one-off retroactive adjustments.","Now, the outlook for the International segment as of July 27. The company's International Land fleet has 29 total rigs, 23 are working and additional 3 rigs are under contract, with activity ranging from waiting on location to rigging up and 3 conventional 3,000-horsepower rigs are stacked in Argentina. Of the contracted rigs, 7 are in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in both Abu Dhabi and Tunisia. The mobilization of the 2 FlexRig3s from our new build facility in Houston to Abu Dhabi is on schedule.","The first rig has spud its first well and the second rig should spud mid-August. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we expect International Land revenue days to increase by 5% to 10% and average daily margin to be down 10% to 15%, primarily due to the absence of the positive one-offs in the previous quarter. In closing, and as we think about the current uncertainty in the industry, our efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering compelling performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create a competitive advantage for the company. The shift to drilling more complex unconventional resource plays that require the drilling at horizontal and directional wells only magnifies our competitive advantage. There is indisputable evidence that a large percentage of the old conventional rigs and lower-end technology product offerings are being displaced by new technology AC drive rigs. This replacement cycle provides additional market share capture for H&P and especially in a soft commodity price environment.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. And now, Tasha, we will open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Luke Lemoine from Capital One South.","Luke M. Lemoine - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","I guess, Juan Pablo, I'm trying to maybe reconcile some of the U.S. Land margin guidance that was given at the end of June. It's supposed to be flat and had a very nice increase of about $1,000. Was that mainly just maintenance deferral in the fiscal 4Q since the OpEx is kind of bouncing back to fiscal 2Q levels?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Well, John, may wish to add something to this, but it was mostly driven by a very nice decline in operating expenses per day, which resulted from the latter part of the quarter reflecting very favorable numbers. We had seen relatively high numbers during the first part of the quarter and we thought it was prudent to guide accordingly, but the results of later were very favorable. John, would you like to add anything?","John W. Lindsay","Luke, I might add, if you look at, and we've talked about this before, look at the several quarters, don't just look at the last quarter or the last couple of quarters. But if you look at it over a 4-, 6-quarter run rate, you'll see a range of expenses. And last quarter, we were on the high end of that range, and this quarter, we were on the low end of that range. And so just a lot of variables, lot of moving parts quarter-to-quarter, and the field operation and everybody in general, just, they've continued to work the costs side really hard. And as Juan Pablo said, the second half of the quarter, things came together for us.","Luke M. Lemoine - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Juan Pablo, I guess, I'm sorry if I missed this, but what was the after-tax value of the equity portfolio?","Juan Pablo Tardio","As of recent weeks or days, it was $281 million approximately.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robin Shoemaker with Citigroup.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to ask, John, you mentioned you have some early termination fees in the current quarter and how many long-term contracts have you -- do customers want to buy out at this point? And are there any of the rigs currently under construction for customers where there is an indication that they would like to buy that out?","John W. Lindsay","Rob, and I'll start with the last. We don't have any, what I would consider, real long-term contracts and we don't have any that are getting ready to deliver that we've had any customers even hint at being interested in and exiting those rigs. They have plans for those rigs, and in a lot of cases, as I have mentioned before, the plan is to high grade the rig fleet when those rigs are delivered. As far as the other rigs, and it's really very similar in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, you're looking at a relatively small number of rigs, and typically, the rigs have very -- I think last quarter it was 45 days on average and I don't know what the average days are left on for fourth quarter thus far, but they're reaching the end of their term. And so if you think about what our customers are doing in general is, they're looking at their rig fleets and then they're trying to figure out what rigs make the most sense. They have other rigs that are on term contracts as well, and so a lot of times it just happens to be that because of the budget discipline that I described, you just kind of be the one that's left without a contract and they end up early terminating it. So it's a relatively small number of days left on the term contract in these cases. It isn't like what we saw in '08 and '09, where we saw multiyear term contracts being early terminated and there was no work to be done. That's not the case here. There's work to be done, it's just in a different budget cycle. They're just looking at trimming budgets.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. That was really what I was getting to and a few other land drilling contractors have mentioned some early terminations, but it doesn't seem to be anything on the scale of what we saw in 2008 and '09. So I guess my other question then just has to do with the rigs that are -- you have, I think, 157 FlexRigs on term, something like 113 on some kind of spot or related pricing contract is, what kind of -- from let's say beginning of the year, late last year, what kind of percentage decline has occurred in the spot pricing of rigs and maybe it varies by basin, but some kind of general indicator if you can?","John W. Lindsay","What timeframe, Rob?","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wherever -- I mean, before this land rig count started to come down a bit, so maybe toward the end of last year or...","John W. Lindsay","Spot pricing in general for us has been increasing during the course of the year until just recently. We've seen some softness and we talked about that even, I think, in the last call. We said that we saw some softness, but we really hadn't seen spot pricing impacted. But we are starting to see some softness in spot market pricing now, and we would expect again in the current commodity price environment we would continue to expect to see a little bit of softness.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But not, I guess, to the point where you would consider stacking a rig as opposed to working it at some kind of a low spot rate?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I would say, in most cases, the rigs that we're stacking, first of all, we've stacked SCR rigs, we have stacked some AC drive rigs and they're kind of in a transitional period. I think most of those AC rigs will go back to work, but I think in a lot of cases, it's just the work is not there. It's really not a function of pricing. I do see that we have some competitors that are, I think, pricing very aggressively in some cases and in some basins. But I think, in general, in our case, we've been able to hold our spot pricing pretty firm.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Hill with Tudor, Pickering.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I noticed your non-rig operating costs in U.S. Land were pretty high this quarter. Usually, they run around $2,500 to $3,000 a day, but it looks like you hit $4,000 a day. Is there any reason for the discrepancy here?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Joe, this is Juan Pablo. I'm not sure that there's a discrepancy there. It just -- we just happen to see additional costs that actually are at the operator's expense, our customer's expense, but we just happen to pay for them and are reimbursed for those. And so that can include items related to transportation and the other equipment rentals, et cetera. We're just seeing more of that, but there's no discrepancies.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then, if we look at the 4 rigs that got early terminated in the quarter, how many are associated with the $7 million in Q4?","Juan Pablo Tardio","The total number of rigs?","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Joe, there is none of those associated with the $7 million. The $7 million refer to the fourth quarter. I think what you're referring to is what impacted our third fiscal quarter.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Correct. So are we talking about termination payments continuing from the 4? Or are we talking about incremental terminations?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Incremental terminations.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we had 4 rigs terminate in Q3 and then we're going to have incremental rigs terminate in Q4 and I wanted to know the number.","Juan Pablo Tardio","It's another 4 or 5 included in that number.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if we think about the terminated rigs as a group, can we ascribe any particular geographic location to these?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Kind of been across. Kind of been across the board, Joe. That really hasn't been just focused in one area. Again, I think, just consider the number of customers that we work for and the number of rigs that they have working and they look up at a budget and say, well, we're going to have to trim this back. I mean, I didn't mention this in my comments, but part of what's driving this is obviously the commodity prices, but we're also drilling wells much faster than anticipated. So that, obviously, increases your spend during the course of the year. So there's some positive there too, and that we're delivering wells more efficiently and cheaper, but we're just drilling a lot more than anticipated.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","John, are you having trouble taking those rigs that have terminated and turning them and losing to spot market? Are these the ones you're stalking or are these going back to work?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, we've been very successful in putting AC drive rigs back to work, particularly Flex 3s. And as I have said in the comments, we've seen opportunities to high grade. A lot of customers have used this as an opportunity to get rid of underperforming rigs, mechanical and SCR rigs. And so it's been a great opportunity for us. Obviously, we do have some AC rigs that are stacked, and we'll continue to have some at least for the next -- at least what we see the next 30 to 60 days. Again, this is an attractive market for us.","Joe Hill - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one last question for me. John, how do you assess demand? Do you keep track of the total number of bids you guys have outstanding or RFPs or something like that? And can you give us some color on how much that's fallen off in the last quarter?","John W. Lindsay","I don't really have a -- I don't have any specific metrics that I can speak to, but there's no doubt that the bid -- the bid activity is down. What's going on is, it's high grading. There's an occasional bid here and there, but it's kind of this transitional rigs getting released and our marketing guys going after great job and finding opportunities and putting rigs to work. Obviously, on the new build side, there's not a lot of bid activity. We did have one here recently, I guess, in the last couple days for 2013. But I mean, in general, a new bid activity, as you can imagine, is very low right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a general question here. As you guys are mapping out the rest of the year and doing the best that you can to kind of gauge some of the sensitivities [indiscernible] and so forth, what do you think prospect is that from this point through the end of the year that the E&P industry essentially just continues to, if you will due to high grading, just lack a sense of urgency, kind of ride out the rest of the year so that there isn't really much in the way of, I think, demand and that the softness continues. If I put that into context of the fact that there's been a significant bounce, obviously, in oil prices back around the $90 level, the strip price for natural gas is well north of $3, I just want to get a read from you guys as whether or not you think the E&P industry will start to get a little bit more optimistic before year end or this will continue to wade out this year and maybe kind of build up their cash and hit the ground running come the first quarter '13, what's your take on that?","Hans C. Helmerich","Kurt, this is Hans. I think you hit on the most important element in your question in terms of oil prices and what level they're perceived to be at so going forward. So I think, psychologically, when we saw oil prices, WTI get under $80, it caused quite a bit of pause. And I think, certainly, people are looking at the last part of their 2012 budgets, but I don't think it might be as bad as you suggest just in terms of, hey, let's just kind of store up and wait until '13. I think people are trying to wade through the uncertainties, watching oil prices closely. One of the things we do here from customers is they don't want to over correct on the downside where they try to spool up too much. And like I said, over correcting that regard, so I think it's going to be oil price driven but not quite as bad as people might think.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So in that context, once again, it appears that they're going to eventually just kind of glide into year end, reassess their portfolios and their opportunities try to get, as you mentioned, high grade the rigs where they can and then take a look at what the strip pricing, the outlook is coming November, December, then probably hit the ground running. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think that's kind of what you maybe -- hopefully what you maybe alluded to.","Hans C. Helmerich","Yes, I think you said it better than I did, so yes.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I think the other -- the third question I had was in relation to your operating cost management process because, once again, as to the first question on the call, the guidance points for the fiscal third quarter were indicating down and margins were much better and deposit is much better. What is it that you're doing that we would expect -- can we expect another reduced operating expense performance? And what do you guys focus on internally, I think, is really the question? So what's driving this reduction in operating expense?","Hans C. Helmerich","Well, I mean, it's a fair question. And like what Juan Pablo said, when we saw the very early indications in the first part of the quarter, they were at similar levels to the prior quarter and slightly elevated from that. And we knew we had a focus on cost reduction in the field that had not gained much traction at that point. So we elected to let you guys know what we saw in terms of the visibility we had at the time. The last 6 weeks of the quarter, we did get some traction and things improved. And so there's a little bit of we'll do more of that and that's our intention, but we've also tried to make clear for the last couple of calls that the volatility and the rig rotation, it can drive some higher cost for us and it's not so easy to predict. And so if we have more rig rotation than we might have anticipated, like we mentioned before, you're going to have some issues on crew retention, you're going to take advantage to spend some money on a rig that's been working all out and it's going to drive some expenses. But clearly, we're being more focused and disciplined on that now and we would expect those efforts to continue to pay dividends. So the ranges that we gave going forward, again, I think John put it in the proper context, you look over a number of quarters and there are 240-plus rigs running out there and there are lots of moving parts, but I think we are gaining traction on improving on MNS and purchasing and cost management. And so we think that, that will be a benefit, but we also know that there's still some rotation and uncertainty. And so it's just we're doing our best to give you guys the best feel of what the go forward looks like, but that's the best we can do.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, can you address the willingness to re-up on term, what the appetite looks like for 3 year, 1 year kinds of work or is everything essentially rolling over into spot and was spot holding up relative to contract?","John W. Lindsay","Yes. I think things were rolling into spot at this stage of the game unless they're just special situations.","Hans C. Helmerich","We have in a few cases, Michael, we've got 6-month term. Obviously, you don't see anyone going in for 2 or 3 year, but there are some. Some of our customers that as rigs are rolling off or as they're contracting rigs that have gotten released, then they're looking at 6-month term contracts but nothing major.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And given where gas and NGL prices are, are any of your customers talking about moving the rigs from the Eagle Ford to the Permian?","John W. Lindsay","We have seen some of that over the course of the summer we've also seen some of that moving out of Oklahoma, moving into the Eagle Ford or moving into the Permian. Those were heavily influenced by NGLs.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Hans or Juan Pablo, how much of the buyback is left? How much dry powders are left in the program?","Hans C. Helmerich","We have authorization for 4 million shares, and typically, what happens is that gets renewed with board meeting cycle. We've got board meeting in early September, so that's been our historic experience.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So $4 million is what's left outstanding or $4 million was the program we should back out this quarter's purchases.","Hans C. Helmerich","Yes, back out this quarter's purchases from the $4 million.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the last question for me is probably is for Juan Pablo. If we look at the pace of new construction slowing down into 2013, how does that impact your cash tax rate?","Juan Pablo Tardio","There are many moving variables, so I'd hate to give you any particular guidance there. We do expect to continue to benefit from accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, for cash tax purposes. But I couldn't give you a specific answer at this point. It will vary depending on many moving variables.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But the 2 big pieces are accelerated depreciation and the capitalized interest, right?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Well, the capitalized -- the latter is -- excuse me, the former is really what drives it, not the latter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Curran with Wells Fargo.","Tom Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Hans or John, as the largest landlord in the Eagle Ford, I think you are in a unique position to best understand and proper insight into that market. So 2 questions there. First, on the demand side, about how much of that demand at this point do you estimate is NGLs driven, and what would seem to be the price thresholds below which you would expect to see a significant cut to activity? And then on the supply side, how far along are we with the influx of Tier 1 rigs from both the dry gas markets that have been in down trend for some time now, as well as possibly the northeast where the Marcellus has been overwhelming the Utica","John W. Lindsay","Tom, this is John. I think on the Tier 1, from our perspective, most of the move from dry gas to oil and liquids rich, I would say most of that transition has taken place for us. We don't have much exposure to dry gas today, and most of that has already taken place and a lot of those rigs moved to the Eagle Ford and to the Permian, a few into Oklahoma. We have had a couple of rigs move out of the Marcellus into the Utica, but we never had a large footprint in the Marcellus to start with. So does that answer your question on...","Tom Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","We'll, I actually meant at the industry level, so looking at the Eagle Ford market as a whole, what is your sense of how many more Tier 1 rigs we might see enter from competitors, particularly out of the northeast where rig releases in the Marcellus had been occurring at a pace of 3:1 with regards to additions in the Utica.","John W. Lindsay","Well, it's a natural place to source going from Marcellus to Utica. I don't really have a feel for it. I think it's going to be demand based on what the Utica is needing. I mean, the Utica seems to be moving a little slower than what I had anticipated, and so that's a kind of a tough one, but that's where you're logically going to get the rigs sourced from is from the Marcellus to go to the Utica. But I don't have a real feel for it. As far as you had mentioned, sourcing into the Eagle Ford, again, I think that's relatively small at this stage based on the rig count. I think there's some high grading going on as well in the Eagle Ford. We've seen quite a few examples where we've high graded competitor rigs when we've had Flex 3s or Flex 4s come available.","Tom Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And have you gotten any read on the demand side when it comes to the NGL directed activity as to significant price levels for your customers?","John W. Lindsay","We haven't seen that much. I think most of our rigs are -- a greater percentage of the production is oil in the Eagle Ford, and so we don't have as much exposure to NGLs. I do recall some time during the summer earlier in the year that we moved a few rigs out of the Eagle Ford that were in NGLs to the Permian, but I don't really have a feel for overall in the industry. I just really have a feel for what we have.","Tom Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I'll just conclude with U.S. wide. How much additional Tier 1 capacity seems likely to come into the market between now and year end that's not in the hands of the big 4? And have you been recently seeing any of those rigs entering without contracts?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think we know, Tom, that our new builds are going in without contracts. And as we look at AC drive rigs, I think we gave a number out of 150 in 2012. You're asking now kind of outside the big 4 and are there some private guidance. Our sense is that's pretty de minimis and maybe it's 20 or less and how many of those are really AC drive rigs versus some refurbished effort is hard to know. So that number may even trend further downward as the rest of the year plays out and maybe those rigs move to the right and find deliveries in 2013.","Tom Curran - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So an already relatively small number that could get even smaller as you might have cancellations or deferrals?","John W. Lindsay","Yes. I think that's right. And then, I think, it sets up for a very modest number of new builds at least in the first part of 2013 just because of this present climate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Fomuk with Wolverine Asset Management.","Michael Fomuk - Wolverine Asset Management, LLC","I understand it's a different business, contract durations. They're a little bit shorter or a lot shorter and smaller, but I just wondered if you could tell me if you're watching the sea drill proposal with more than a passing interest?","John W. Lindsay","Well, hey, look, a little attention to offshore peers, but you're talking about their MLP?","Michael Fomuk - Wolverine Asset Management, LLC","Yes.","John W. Lindsay","No, not really. I mean, I think that they're a unique player in that space and I don't know if it translates, at least to this point, it's the land side.","Michael Fomuk - Wolverine Asset Management, LLC","Is there a point clearly when there's an up-cycle again where you could foresee visiting something like that?","Hans C. Helmerich","I think we're pretty open minded, but we expect for there to be an up-cycle, and I think we've got a pretty good approach in model for attacking that. So that would be our intent at least at this point.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brad Lundy with Ivory Capital.","Bradley M. Lundy - Ivory Investment Management, L.P.","Just on a quick follow-up on the buybacks. Did you guys repurchase any shares following the quarter end?","Hans C. Helmerich","Well, no, we have that blackout period that we abided by, so we've been out of the market.","Bradley M. Lundy - Ivory Investment Management, L.P.","Okay. So it's fair to say there's still 2.25 million shares left on the authorization?","Hans C. Helmerich","Correct.","Bradley M. Lundy - Ivory Investment Management, L.P.","Okay. And then the context of the board meeting in early September, is this just a normal meeting or is there a more in-depth evaluation of the capital structure at that point?","Hans C. Helmerich","No. It's really an ongoing conversation we have with our board and they're engaged in these issues and so there's nothing special about it.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time.","Juan Pablo Tardio","All right.

The increase in dayrates speaks to the high value our teams are providing and the strong partnerships we continue to nurture with our customers.","There are four areas of discussion I want to focus on this morning. First is the pricing and market share success we've delivered. Our U.S. Land operations benefited from higher activity and pricing as we continue to capitalize on our superior position in the sold-out super-spec market. H&P's leading-edge spot pricing is approaching the mid $20,000 per day range and average stock pricing is nearing $22,000 per day.","In addition to our success in obtaining better dayrates in commercial terms, we have also been able to improve market share in both the overall rig count as well as the super-spec fleet where we believe we have approximately 42% market share today. Further, we have leading market share position in the top three most active basins in the U. S.","Looking forward and provided that the strong oil price environment persists, we believe we will maintain pricing power and would expect the average spot market pricing to close the gap with today's leading-edge pricing over the next few quarters. I'd like to take this time to give our account managers and our sales and marketing group a lot of credit for their efforts to improve pricing to better reflect the value proposition we provide customers. I want to thank each of you for your efforts.","My second area of focus this morning pertains to the super-spec outlook and the metrics that drives super-spec demand. We maintained the leadership position in the super-spec rig market. Throughout the first nine months of the fiscal year, we upgraded 38 FlexRigs to super-spec capacity, bringing the total to 191 super-spec FlexRigs in our U.S. Land fleet.","As I mentioned earlier, the market is tight for FlexRigs and we expect this trend to endure as more customers embrace the technologies that drive unconventional drilling economics. On the drilling side, the primary markers for well complexity in U.S. Land are the increased lateral length, multi-well pad drilling and tighter well spacing. The average lateral length today is slightly over 8,000 feet, which is a significant increase from 6,000 feet that we had in 2015.","The primary attraction of a super-spec rig are the benefits of the incremental performance capability it delivers and the positive impact that has on the cost and, therefore, the risk and economics of a project. A few of the performance factors include faster rig move time, mud pumping capacity, multi-well pad capability, setback capacity and just an overall more efficient drilling operation.","We plan to continue our current upgrade cadence, which has averaged 12 rigs per quarter. If the demand from customers remain strong enough to command a two-year term contract in mid 20s dayrates, we will maintain the cadence.","In addition to the Flex3s we have available for upgrade, we have also identified seven FlexRig4s that we can convert to FlexRig3 walking rigs with super-spec capacity at a similar investment to the FlexRig3 upgrade.","With all the super-spec FlexRig getting all the headlines, it's our people leveraging the technology and their attention to safety, customer service, process excellence and delivering value that differentiates the H&P brand from the others.","My third point today is on the strong market demand, but I also want to give you our perspective on the Permian transportation bottleneck that is causing concern in the industry. Oil prices have hovered in the mid-60s to low-70s during the quarter and we believe most E&P budgets in the current year reflect a $50 to $55 per barrel oil price. Therefore, we are optimistic that E&P spending in 2018 is not yet fully reflecting the potential increase in CapEx and rig count in 2019 and we are bullish on the prospects for continued momentum into the new year.","The Permian issue has clouded the near-term outlook somewhat, but H&P continues to experience strong demand and we are adding rigs accordingly. Our rig count in this basin today is at 114 rigs, up from 107 rigs at the end of the second fiscal quarter. And we continue to have customers committing to super-spec FlexRigs in calendar Q4 and Q1, in addition to a few standard service FlexRig3s and FlexRig4s. With the commitments we have in hand today, we could reach roughly 120 rigs in the Permian by fiscal year-end.","So we hear all of the looming concerns surrounding takeaway capacity in the Permian. Though we are seeing indications of a pullback and the strong oil price environment that we've experienced of late, we're also seeing improved rig activity in other plays as well.","So another part of the growth story for H&P is our strong footprint in each of these top four activity basins. We currently have 24% market share of active rigs in the Permian, 37% in the Eagle Ford, 25% in the SCOOP\/STACK play and 14% in the Bakken.","We believe that budget dollars could shift from the Permian to other basins, if needed, with a plus $55 oil price. Higher crude oil prices have also positively impacted our International and Offshore businesses as additional rigs were contracted during the June quarter. We are actively pursuing opportunities in these segments and will hopefully begin to see additional growth in fiscal 2019, especially in Argentina with its unconventional resource plays.","My final point is an update on our technology subsidiaries and our continued advances in drilling automation. We are gratified to see increasing numbers of customers realizing the long-term value proposition and the services provided by our new technology subsidiaries \u2013 MOTIVE Drilling Technologies and Magnetic Variation Services, also known as MagVAR.","Driven by industry trends toward longer laterals and tighter well spacing, both companies are growing activity at impressive rates on both H&P FlexRigs and on other contractor rigs. These technologies are leading-edge, create additional opportunities to utilize our digital FlexRig platform and provide an important driver in the evolution of drilling automation.","As a compelling update to that evolution, we are currently delivering very promising results in our next stage of directional automation. Field trials are underway in the Permian Basin on several FlexRigs and it has successfully drilled multiple extended reach horizontal wells including all sections of the well, namely the vertical, the curve and lateral sections.","These drilling trials were accomplished autonomously over the majority of the drilling process of the well. Using proprietary algorithms enabled by combining our MOTIVE value-driven automation platform with our FlexRig digital control system, automated slides were accomplished with accuracy and performance that often exceeded those executed by the most experienced human directional drillers.","As the directional drillers remain an important part of the rig operation, these tools are enhancing the quality of the wellbore. Using the autonomous car analogy, this would be similar to level three out of five levels, where there is still a driver but he's not required to touch the steering wheel except in rare occasions. More to come on this, but we are pleased with the progress in these trials.","MOTIVE and MagVAR continue to lead their respective market segments with MOTIVE actively steering over 500 horizontal wells and over 7 million feet of guided footage and MagVAR is active on over 240 rigs and continuing to grow its leadership position in the survey correction market.","Before turning the call over to Mark, we achieved another milestone in addition to drilling automation. In June, we activated our first multiple-activity FlexRig and you may have seen that on Instagram or Facebook. The new multi-FlexRig design is easily distinguished by the rig actually having two derricks, also maybe called a mast, but in general I think people will refer to them as derricks. This rig is the first of its kind in onshore U.S. and it's another good example of our family of solutions that H&P is capable of offering to customers.","This particular project is the result of H&P collaborating with a longtime customer in pursuit of creating additional value to their well programs. Our engineering group did a fantastic job in listening to the customer, working with the customer and delivering on the vision.","The new prototype rig design is a combination of a FlexRig5 and a FlexRig4, allowing the customer to perform multiple functions safely, efficiently and simultaneously. We've had several inquiries about the multi-FlexRig and we will be analyzing reliability and performance over the next few quarters.","And now I'll turn the call over to Mark Smith.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thanks, John. Today I will review our fiscal third quarter's operating results, provide guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year and comment on our financial position.","Let's start with highlights for the recently completed third quarter. The company generated quarterly revenues of $649 million versus $577 million in the previous quarter. The increase in revenue is primarily due to the increase in revenue days and average quarterly revenue per day in the U.S. Land segment. Operating costs correspondingly increased to $445 million for the third quarter versus $386 million for the previous Q.","General and administrative expenses totaled $52 million, higher than our prior guidance due primarily to additions to our employee counts and partially to nonrecurring professional fees.","Our income tax provision from continuing operations consists of discrete tax items that are approximately $9 million related to state and international jurisdictions where we operate.","Concluding this quarter's results, H&P incurred a diluted loss per share of $0.08 in the third quarter versus a loss of $0.12 in the previous quarter. Both quarters were adversely impacted by a $0.07 per share of selected items, as highlighted in our press release. Absent these items, the diluted loss per share for the quarter was $0.01 in Q3 versus a loss of $0.05 during the second fiscal quarter.","Now turning to our three segments, beginning with the U.S. Land segment. We exited the third fiscal quarter with 224 contracted rigs and had an increase of approximately 5% in the number of active rigs quarter-to-quarter. We continued to experience growth in activity from beginning to end of the quarter and expect a similar increase through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Since the last earnings call on April 26, our activity has increased by 11 rigs. The Permian once again led the way with a seven rig increase.","As John mentioned, H&P has leading market share in the top three U.S. basins \u2013 the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the SCOOP\/STACK. Our activity levels in each are at 114, 37 and 33 rigs contracted, respectively. We have 43 idle FlexRigs in the Permian, 18 of which are upgradable to super-spec; 25 idle FlexRigs in the Eagle Ford, 21 of which are upgradable to super-spec; as well as 2 idle FlexRigs in the SCOOP\/STACK, both of which are upgradable.","The favorable market conditions that John mentioned continue to allow pricing improvements. Excluding the early termination revenue, our average rig revenue per day increased to $23,400 for the quarter. The average rig expense per day increased to $14,934 due in part to the Permian wage increase mentioned in the previous quarter's earnings call and in part to higher pass-through costs and other one-time costs.","Now looking ahead at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 for U.S. Land, we expect a sequential increase of approximately 6% in the quarterly number of revenue days, representing an average rig count of approximately 230 rigs. Compared to the third quarter at $23,400 per day, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to increase to approximately $24,000. The expected increase is driven by market dynamics as customers continue to contract for super-spec FlexRigs across numerous basins due to the differentiated value they deliver to our customers. We will, however, continue to see the rollover of legacy new-build term contracts partially offset these increases.","The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to approximately $14,700, absent one-time costs that affected the current quarter and as our idle rig count continues to decline. The normalized average rig expense per day directly related to rigs working in the U.S. Land segment is approximately $13,700, an increase of $200 per day sequentially due in part to higher auxiliary expenses. This per day estimate excludes the impact of expenses directly related to inactive rigs and the upfront reactivation expenses related to rigs that have been idle for a significant amount of time.","Historically, the company has stated its normalized average rig expense per day as $13,000 and now that level is $13,700. It's very important to keep in perspective that the recent increase in this normalized operating cost is mostly margin neutral as it is comprised of costs that are passed through to the customer. Part of the higher normalized cost relates to the Permian wage increase, with most of the remaining relating to some of the auxiliary services our customers demand.","We had an average of 131 active rigs under term contracts during the third quarter. Today, 129 of our 227 contracted rigs are under term contracts and all but 26 were priced in the post downturn market. We expect to have an average of 126 rigs under term contract in the fiscal fourth quarter, earning an average margin of $10,500 per day. For the seven new rigs we already have under term contract in 2019, we expect to average margins to expand to approximately $11,500. For the 14 rigs under term contract in fiscal 2020, the associated margin is $14,100.","Turning to our Offshore Operations segment, we reactivated one platform rig during the third quarter, resulting into six rigs contracted at the end of the third quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially, which was driven primarily by higher than expected rig startup cost to put that sixth rig back to work.","As we look forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 for the Offshore segment, we currently have six of our eight offshore rigs active. While there are opportunities to put additional rigs to work over time, nothing is imminent at this time. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to a more normalized level of approximately $13,000 during the fourth quarter versus the last few quarters.","Regarding our International Land segment, as expected, the number of quarterly revenue days increased sequentially in the third quarter by approximately 15% due to three rigs reactivating in the Colombian market. We expect to end the fourth quarter with 19 to 20 active rigs in this segment, including 15 in Argentina, 3 to 4 in Colombia and 1 in Bahrain. We believe our market share in the overall Argentina rig market is about 20% while our share of the unconventional drilling market there is much higher. Given our relative scale and strong footprint, we believe we are positioned to grow as the Argentina unconventional market continues to develop.","Now let me look forward on corporate items for the remainder of this fiscal year. Our CapEx investment strategy this fiscal year has resulted in increasing market share for H&P in the Permian and other U. S. basins. Our FlexRig upgrades enhance the capabilities and useful lives of our existing fleet and enable us to provide value and meet customer needs today and into the future.","Given H&P's increased level of contracted rigs and the opportunities we are seeing to upgrade FlexRigs to super-spec capacity, we have adjusted our capital expenditure estimate to be at the high end of our previous range of guidance at approximately $450 million. Note that approximately 40% of standard CapEx \u2013 of the estimated CapEx range is attributable to maintenance CapEx, including tubulars.","Depreciation is still expected to be approximately $550 million, plus an additional $35 million or so in abandonments that are primarily related to super-spec FlexRig upgrades. The total depreciation estimate is $585 million for the full fiscal 2018 year.","Our general and administrative expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $200 million. We have significantly enhanced our technology and innovation capabilities with the acquisitions of MOTIVE and MagVAR. In addition, as John has mentioned in prior quarters, we have added expanded capabilities in Tulsa to support our growing rig fleets with the goal to reduce certain field expenses. Also note that when we built our original fiscal 2018 budget, our U.S. Land rig count was 190. And today it is 227 operating rigs and growing.","As we mentioned last quarter, the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate for our September 30, 2018 fiscal year-end is approximately 25%. In addition to the U.S. statutory rate we are expecting incremental state and foreign income taxes to impact our tax provisions.","Now looking at our financial position. Helmerich & Payne had cash on hand of approximately $306 million at June 30, 2018 and short-term investments of $44 million. Including our revolving credit facility availability, our liquidity was approximately $611 million. Our debt-to-capital at quarter-end was 10%, a best-in-class measurement amongst our peer group. We have no debt maturity until 2025.","Our opportunistic reinvestment in our FlexRig fleet serves to strengthen our asset base and position H&P for the continuing onshore and conventional up-cycle. Our goal is to increase market share while effectively utilizing our existing FlexRig asset base. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity level and term contract backlog provide H&P the flexibility to pursue that goal while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders through our very longstanding dividend. Therefore, our free cash flow generated from operations continues to be reinvested in the fleet and return to shareholders.","As we pursue our market share growth goal through existing FlexRig reactivations and upgrades that remain available to us, we will consume a portion of our cash on hand. We do not expect to have to utilize our revolving credit facility availability. Looking ahead in the planning horizon, this investment in our fleet coupled with the disciplined and centralized cost focus will yield expanding positive free cash flows.","That concludes our prepared comments for the third fiscal quarter. Now let me turn the call over to Wendy for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we will take our first question from Tommy Moll with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Tommy.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","I wanted to follow up on your comment about the Flex4 upgrade potential. I think you called out seven Flex4s where you think there's a potential upgrade to super-spec with the capital investments and were in line with the Flex3 walking upgrades. Am I right that that's about the $8 million range under the two-year term and mid-20s provide efficient returns or with the basic parameters that the contract need to be more attractive?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. Tommy, that is, so it's a Flex4 that we're doing a conversion on. So we're converting the Flex4 to the Flex3 walking. And yes, that is ballpark $8 million. And our expectation would be that it's in line with how we've described these upgrades two-year term contracts and mid-20s pricing.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","Great. And just as a follow-up, have you peeked at the remainder of the Flex4 fleet to think about how deep you could go in there for upgrades? Or was it just at first look you found seven, but could potentially go back later?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. I think we've kind of talked about this over time. We haven't spent a whole lot of time on this just simply because we haven't had the time and we've had, of course, all of the upgrades on the FlexRig3s. So, our engineering group did some work, came up with these seven. We haven't done any additional work on the others. There'll be more to come on that, but it's kind of hard to say what the timeline would be.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","Fair enough. And then shifting to technology, your advantage there goes back a number of years with the original FlexRig capability. More recently, we've seen it with the acquisition of MOTIVE of MagVAR, which suggests now the curve is more in terms of data and automation. Can you update us on how those integrations are going? What anecdotes you're getting from customers? And do you see other kinds of technological capabilities you might want to add to the portfolio? Thanks.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","You're welcome. Sure. The integration of both companies has been really good. It's been a strong integration. Really similar cultures, which is important I think to success. I think what really speaks to the success is, if you look at the rig count growth, MOTIVE is I think around 30 or so rigs and I think when we made the acquisition, we were probably at 10 or so.","So there is some adoption. As you know, in our business, technology adoption can be somewhat slow. But it's got some real upside, it's got some real opportunities. You heard us talk about wellbore quality and wellbore placement being more and more important. So MOTIVE plays a big role in that, as does MagVAR. And again, MagVAR has over 240 rigs that they're working on today. I want to say H&P is about a third of both the companies in terms of FlexRigs. So that's important.","And then to kind of highlight the automation piece, MOTIVE is playing a large role in that in working with the H&P team and getting, like I said, to kind of that level three automation, so we're excited about that as well. So I think both acquisitions have been strategic. Are there other opportunities out there? Obviously, we're always keeping our eyes open looking for other opportunities. The data side is an important side of the equation as well. So, yeah, we're feeling pretty good about it.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you. That's all for me.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Take care.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Brad.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","I guess, let's talk some numbers, please. So, with 126 rigs contracted versus the 106 that you talked about in mid-May, can you tell us a little about the term on those 20 rigs and some color on the rates as they may have compared with contracts earlier in the year?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yes, Brad.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Okay. I was afraid for a minute I got cut off.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","The average term of those is really about a year, I would say. And our rates, as John had alluded to in his prepared comments, are approaching mid-20s.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Presumably I think we're supposed to believe that they were higher than contracts made through, say, the first calendar quarter or even in April or something? I mean, have we seen progression through the course of the year?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We have, Brad. I think Mark's reference to one year is the average that's on those 120. The most recent contracts we're entering into are between one year and two year. If there are upgrades, we're requiring two years. So that's obviously a factor. The most recent term contracts we're entering into are higher than the average for those non-new-build term contracts.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay, thank you. And then, I guess, I'm going to ask for your perspective on some of the industry and the upgrade opportunities to super-spec. I'm actually just coming off a call where we've heard about one of your competitors taking 1,000 horsepower rigs and putting a fair amount of capital, I guess, it was about $15 million apiece to upgrade four rigs to super-spec capability. How much are you hearing that around the industry? And has it changed your perspective? I think if we rewind to your recent comments, we were still talking about roughly 100 rigs that you thought could be upgraded fairly easily to super-spec. Is that number growing now? Again, I reference one example from today and your own example, of course, from the Flex4s. But is that number starting to grow? And if so, have you tabulated it?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Brad, I don't know that that number is growing that much. And the reason why is because in our calculation, if you're using the pure super-spec definition that we use, we think there's around 450 that are running today that have been upgraded. There's another 200 or so that we think can be upgraded. We have I think around or close to half of those, maybe it's 40% now, and I think half of those 200 are working. So I think the question still remains, outside of the H&P fleet, which of those rigs that fit kind of the description are actually going to be able to be upgraded at a reasonable price.","And then to the rest of your question is, well, what about the 1,000 horsepower. So it's interesting that some contractors are taking I think the strategy of looking at some of the lower-end horsepower rigs and upgrading them to a higher capacity. And then others, some of those 1,500 horsepower rigs they may deem are just not economic to upgrade to put back into the marketplace. I'm not certain we have enough information right now. I still think \u2013 I think we've been pretty consistent in saying that the total upgradable fleet we thought was probably in the 600 to 700 range. In the pure kind of classic definition, like I said, is anywhere from 600 to 650 and then there's another 50 to 100 that are out there that I think are probably captured in the rigs that you're describing.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Got you. Got you. Okay.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Brad, I would just remind that the place we're in and the market here at Helmerich & Payne is a good place to be relative to the numbers you threw out. With essentially 75 FlexRig3s and the 7 FlexRig4 conversions John mentioned in his prepared comments, we have 82 that we can take to super-spec that cost us $8 million or less essentially depending on the type of multi-pad capability that we put on the vessel.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","I understand that point, for sure, but thanks for pointing that out. Okay. Very good, guys. I'll turn it back. Thanks.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thanks, Brad.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Colin Davies with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Colin.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just I'd like to talk a little bit more about this Permian issue. And obviously, it's very encouraging in the prepared remarks that you've got line of sight to increased activity in the next quarter and beyond as well. But as we think about this fundamentally temporary phenomenon in the play with the takeaway capacity issue, can you give some color as to sort of where does your line of sight or confidence in that outlook start to wither a little bit? I mean, are we talking middle of next year or beginning of next year or the end of next year?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Colin, I don't know that we have enough clear insight and to go out that far out into the future and which is why we try to keep our prepared remarks to the rest of this quarter, the rest of this calendar year, I even mentioned I think Q1 of 2019 and primarily the reason with Q1 \u2013 calendar Q1 of 2019. And the primary reason I mentioned that is because we have some customers that are committing to and contracting rigs, super-spec rigs that are taking upgrades in that first calendar quarter and in the Permian Basin.","So we haven't seen any behavior change from customers. Again, we think that today's activity is a function of a $50 to $55 oil price, not a $65 to low $70 oil price that we've actually been experiencing. So our customers have been very disciplined with their capital. They haven't adjusted their budgets upward. We think that there's a possibility that budgets could be adjusted upward and higher numbers of rigs working in 2019. How that all shakes out through the Permian bottleneck issue is really kind of hard to completely get your arms around, but really what we're speaking to are behaviors and commitments that customers are making.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. And just one follow-up, if I may. Perhaps related to that, when we think about the growth that you're starting to see around the super-spec demand, even within the Permian, can you give some color as to how much of that is, if you like, net growth and how much of it is displacement of perhaps rigs of non-super-spec category that those customers are now drilling, taking that programs and displacing with a super-spec rig?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think it's probably a mix is probably the right answer. We do know that there are examples that will have a customer pick up a super-spec FlexRig with the intent of displacing a lower-performing rig. Sometimes that rig is an AC rig and sometimes that rig is an SCR rig. One thing to keep in mind, you may have heard us say before, I think there's still around 270 legacy rigs, SCR mechanical rigs that are drilling horizontal and directional wells today. When you start considering the lateral length trends, the well complexity trends, those older rigs are going to \u2013 I think it's going to be harder for them to continue to compete. So I think that the cycle remains \u2013 the upgrade cycle remains \u2013 I think that's going to continue to happen. But I do think it's a combination. I think both replacements and additional rigs are taking place.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Is there any sense that that dynamic of demand displacement is higher in the Permian, given the Permian has just different maturity relative to some of the other basins?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think there's some reasoning behind that. I don't have the facts to support it. But I think it does make sense because that basin has been in terms of years in the unconventional play, particularly the longer laterals, it's not as mature as, say, the Eagle Ford or the Bakken maybe, but I think there is potential there.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right, Colin. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Kurt.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey Mark. And welcome aboard, Mark.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you. It's good to be here.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, hey, John, obviously, I think you definitely peaked my interest in what you said about launching a dual-derrick land drilling rig. Obviously, the dual-derrick concept has been deployed on drillships primarily offshore. So it's kind of the first foray of that into the land drilling business. So maybe give us some context, John, if possible, to kind of get a sense as to what kind of adoption rate you might expect for the dual-derrick concept over time? And do you see it evolving potentially in the same way that the FlexRig evolved when Helmerich & Payne first launched that concept back in the early \u2013 in mid-2000s?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Kurt, I think it's very, very early in the game to try to really understand what kind of application it's going to have onshore. This is something that we've kind of talked about internal for a while. We had a customer that had a lot of interest in trying it and I think we kind of work together and help make that happen. I think there's still a lot of \u2013 again, the rig's just been out since mid-June, so there's still a lot of opportunity for learning. But when you start thinking about some of the advantages that \u2013 minimizing flat time, NPT, some of the economics and just some of the simultaneous operations that might be able to go on have some capability. But again, I think they're looking at as kind of multi-functionality, the rigs can work together, they can also work offline from one another.","So I think it is different than the Offshore model. There's probably some similarities, but I think there's also some additional capacity. Obviously, we're not limited by a footprint of the structure, of the ship, whether it's a drillship or whether it's a platform. We do have the ability to have those rigs work together and then also kind of independently. So it's got some features.","I think from an H&P perspective, it's a FlexRig5 and a FlexRig4. We obviously have the capability to do more of those \u2013 these types of rigs, these type of projects with the fleet that we have. But again, I think we're probably a couple of quarters in trying to figure out what that's going to look like. We thought it would make a lot of sense to get out and talk about it. Again, it hit Instagram and Facebook pretty hard, so we thought we'd at least get out there and talk about it a little bit.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Interesting. Interesting concept. Okay. That's great. So, I guess, my follow-up question would be along the lines of \u2013 outside the Permian, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of potential rig demand? And I just wondered if you might be able to put that into context I think there's been some discussions that I've had with varying investors that say, okay, it's unlikely to see any increase or potential significant increase in drilling outside the Permian because E&P companies have pretty much bet the motherload on acreage in the Permian and don't have a whole lot to kind of go after outside the Permian. I just wondered if you could provide some perspective on that.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yes, Kurt. Our rig count is up slightly in the Eagle Ford, a couple or two or three rigs. We got a couple rigs that went to work in SCOOP\/STACK play. We've had some commitments in the Bakken, which are positive. Again, I think kind of the underlying theme here is that with budgets set with a $50 to $55 oil price environment and with budgets being reset towards the end of the year going into 2019. And if it is a $60 to $65 or $65 to $70 oil price environment outlook, I think you have to believe that you're going to see some additional activity in many of these basins that have oil production.","And again, the great news for H&P as part of the growth story is that we have rigs in those basins that are idle that can be upgraded to super-spec and then some that are idle that probably won't need to be upgraded to super-spec in some cases because that's part of what we see today. I think we still have 26 or 27 FlexRigs that are running today that aren't upgraded to super-spec and we have I think eight Flex4s that are running that, again, in a stronger oil price environment probably find their way into finding additional work. Because, again, if you think about that Flex4 rig competing against an SCR or a mechanical rig drilling a horizontal well, I like our chances to be able to compete in that sort of environment.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And if I just may close out with one additional follow-up on the operating cost side. I know, Mark, you went through and gave us a revision on kind of the normalizing operating cost around $13,700 per day. I just wondered if you guys can put that into a context as it relates to at what level or what number of working rigs would it take to get that operating cost to that normalized level? How should we think about that?","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","The $13,700 normalized is, I mean, we're there. The incremental cost or essentially the reactivation costs and the idling cost approximately $1,000 that get you from $13,700 to $14,700. So we think the $13,700 is a number where we will hold.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So that would assume no additional upgrades, you'd be kind of maxed out on what you could provide to the market. I guess, that's what I was trying to \u2013 I was just trying to kind of get that into \u2013 trying to figure out that concept. Is that right?","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I don't know if I'm following that last part of your question, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's all right. That's all right. I'll follow up offline. That's fine.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you, Mark.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Appreciate the call.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thanks, Kurt.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Daniel with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Guys, just a couple hopefully easier ones for me. John, can you just provide a bit more color on customer demand and ideally share with us what you perceive to be the mindset of the sort of customer sub-segments, private versus small cap versus large cap E&P players? I mean, I know it's a generalization, but any color would be appreciated.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","John, I don't know that I have a clear differentiating view between one versus the other. I think clearly what the larger companies, the public companies, it's clear that they're having a high level of capital discipline and they've made their budgets, they're sticking to their budgets, they're being very thoughtful in their decisions and what they're doing.","I think what the smaller companies and you probably heard me say this over time is that one of the only good things about the downturn is it gives us an opportunity to work for customers that we previously never would have had an opportunity work for. So I think we have 70 customers today. We didn't have 70 customers when we had 300 rigs running in 2014. So we've expanded our customer base and we do have exposure. But I don't really have a sense for really anything other than that. Is there anything, Dave or Mark you can think of?","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","No, I think the new rigs that we've been putting to work this last quarter and some of the commitments we have, as John had alluded to, into the next couple of quarters, we still see a mix across various types of E&P clients. So no discernible differences I would say between the type of client.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Because there have been some speculation that as you get in the back half of the year, those that would be more likely to potentially release rigs would be the smaller, less well-capitalized customers, okay. Nice to know. It sounds like you're not seeing anything that would suggest that that basket of clientele is looking to drop rigs?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I sure don't think so. I mean, the fact of the matter is there's always a certain level of churn in the rig count. I think the reason that customers wouldn't begin to release rigs at the end of the year, particularly if they have a high performing rig and a super-spec rig is if you're going to then get back into the business in the first quarter of 2019. Now you're going to be in line and you're going to have to go contract a rig and then you're more than likely going to have to pull it out of STACK and you're going to have to go through the whole upgrade process.","So I find it a little challenging to consider that they would release a rig thinking that they're just going to turn around, pick it back up in a quarter or two because it just isn't going to \u2013 I don't believe it's going to work out that way. So I think most of the operators know that. I think if they've got a good rig, they've got a quality rig, I think they're going to hang on to it. I'd be surprised that they would release it. Now if it's not a high performing rig then you might as well roll the dice and see what you come back up with later.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Okay. And then just \u2013 thank you for that \u2013 last one for me and this is probably an off-the-wall comment or question. But do you guys still maintain operations in California? And if so, what's the outlook for that market?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","John, we don't. We exited I think in 2015 \u2013 2015 or 2016. We worked there for many, many years. We worked offshore. We had platform rigs offshore. We had a big land presence there, but it just \u2013 the environment, it's very, very challenging to work in from a personnel perspective. We have great people in California. As a matter of fact, when you go to our West Texas operation and you visit rigs, it's highly likely you're going to run into some of our employees that are still living in California and working for us in West Texas. They work on two and two schedule \u2013 two week on, two week off. Great employees, very, very good workforce. But it's not very business friendly, at least it wasn't friendly for the land contractors in California. So I really can't speak to what's going on out there.","John Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Fair enough. I probably should have remembered, but forgot. Thank you, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","No, no problem. Thanks, John.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Taylor Zurcher with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead.","Taylor Zurcher - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Sure.","Taylor Zurcher - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","John, in the period from June 30 to today, your contracted rig count in U.S. Land has obviously moved higher, but it seems like there's been a slight mix shift from term contracted rigs, some of those rolling to spot. And so just curious if you think that's indicative of some customers trying to preserve some flexibility into year-end or perhaps just noise in the numbers or some underlying dynamic at play?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","In terms of having more rigs under term contract?","Taylor Zurcher - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","In terms of having less rigs under term contract. If I look at June 30, you had 136 rigs and today, looks like 129. So just curious if that's just some noise or if you...?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, it's just a little bit of noise. I'm sure it mostly had to do with just a large number of rigs that rolled off during the quarter and we just didn't enter into as many rigs that were rolling off as we were entering into. That's really what the function was. So I think we went from 60% of our rigs term to 55% or 56%. I mean, it's very, very small change.","Mark W. Smith - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","And some of those rolling off, I'll just add, were some of our older contracts that were actually entered into pre the downturn.","Taylor Zurcher - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. That makes sense. And then last question for me is on International. I mean, you've obviously added a few rigs over the past several months. As we look forward, you still have some idle rig capacity in Latin America. And specific to Argentina, just curious, I mean, it seems like that will be a hotspot moving forward or continue to be a hotspot moving forward, how you're viewing that market moving forward? And if we might see you guys move rigs from other regions in Latin America potentially to Argentina or even from the U.S.?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, I think there's an opportunity for us to continue to put rigs back to work in Colombia as well as in Argentina. And I think it is. I think there's a high likelihood or at least our hope would be is that we can continue to build on our strong market share in Argentina. We're in a great position there. We've got a nice customer base with YPF and other IOCs and NOCs there and hopefully we'll have an opportunity to do that. We have Flex3s here in the U.S. that we can move down there, both standard Flex3s as well as the opportunity to upgrade to super-spec, which I think that's what we're going to see. I think we're going to see more of a super-spec type offering required in Argentina because the laterals are starting to begin to trend longer. You're going to have a lot of the same opportunities that we've seen here in the U.S. So that would be our expectation. I think in our comments we had talked about 2019. As you know, if you pulled the trigger today, you're still going to \u2013 you're probably six month out before you can get the first rig in the country.","Taylor Zurcher - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Hi Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","John, I wanted to ask about super-spec rigs either upgrades or those that can roll off contract. Just at this point, can you talk about your appetite for greater term versus higher rates as you're signing incremental contracts? And how you view your customers in terms of how they value that same trade off in terms of you're looking for lower price versus the optionality of shorter term? Just how do you characterize both sides of the table?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, I think we've got a balanced approach. I mean, we've talked about on the last call \u2013 last couple of calls, I guess, that we're in a position where as kind of the swing producer in the super-spec, we don't want to overbuild it, if at all possible, so we want to make certain the customer actually needs a super-spec and not just wants a super-spec and actually that's what we're seeing. We have high levels of demand. We also have high levels of usage. The customers that have super-spec are \u2013 85% to 90% of the wells they're drilling are super-spec requirement type wells. So that's a good thing. So, at this stage of the cycle, we think two years and the mid-20s is a great place to be. And I think that would be our pricing model. For right now, that's our strategy right now. We're really not in a position to share anything past that. But I think that's a good place to be.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And how about customers?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","In terms of their desire for?","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, the similar tradeoff on their side, yes?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. I think most of the customers we're working for have multiple rigs running and they have their rigs staggered on term. And so I think it's a good balance on their part as well. The fact of the matter for us is, is that we're not going to put a super-spec rig out without a two-year term contract and attractive pricing. And if they need that sort of a rig and capability, they're obviously willing to pay that.","I think maybe another part of your question is they're thinking about this longer term, I don't get any feel that, oh my gosh, I'm really concerned if I got to lock into a two-year term contract. They've got a pretty long horizon. What they wouldn't want to do is, of course, lock every rig in their fleet up on two years. But to have a mix I don't think is not problematic at all.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. That makes a lot of sense. Just, obviously, you've your hands full in the U.S. right now, but the International Land cycle maybe just getting some momentum here. We just discussed Argentina a little bit. But thinking about the rest of the world, is there appetite for you to at some point really scale up your International fleet or any markets that are \u2013 you think are particularly attractive to target in the next cycle here?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, you followed us a long time, you know we have the desire \u2013 we have the desire, we have the capability, we have the balance sheet to do it. We have skill sets to do it. It's just finding those right markets where you can get a reasonable rate of return for the capital that you are investing. And then also I think it's important when you're investing the kind of money that some of these projects require is that you do get a firm term take-or-pay type contract. Sometimes that's problematic internationally.","If we can get that then I think there is a high likelihood that H&P grows. That's why I think Argentina is probably the most logical place right now. I do think there's some opportunities in the near future in the Middle East. But again, I think those are 2019, 2020 type opportunities. We've got a long view on it. We've been working on this for a long time and want to continue to exploit those opportunities. But the fact of the matter is that the best area to invest your capital from a drilling contractor perspective for the last 10 years has been in the U.S. market and it's still a good place right now. And like you say, hopefully, there's opportunities internationally as well.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No doubt. That's very helpful. Thanks, John.","John W.

With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO. John and Juan Pablo will be sharing some comments with us, after which we'll open the call for questions.","As usual and as defined by the U.S. Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations in today's press release.","That said, I'll turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone.","Our second quarter operational results were strong and our team continues to execute in superb fashion in this steadily-improving market. Higher crude oil prices bolstered increases in the U.S. rig count, which in turn supported rig pricing improvements during the quarter.","In the current oil price environment, we expect pricing to increase for rigs and auxiliary services according performance and H&P's unique value proposition.","Today, I'll focus on four areas: what we're experiencing as it relates to market demand; our work in the Permian Basin, which is the epicenter of the industry's recovery; what we're seeing in International and Offshore markets; and finally, how our leading-edge technology is addressing the trend toward increasing well complexity throughout the industry.","The demand for super-spec rigs persists and the industry's fleet remains nearly 100% utilized. H&P continues its leadership position with more than 40% as a super-sec market share in U.S. Land unconventional plays.","We also have about half of the industry's idle rig capacity that is viable for upgrading to super-spec classification in this current pricing environment. This factor, combined with our robust financial position, the composition of our fleet and the infrastructure supporting the FlexRig value proposition, will continue to enable the company to respond to current and future demand for super-spec FlexRigs.","The Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico is the most active basin in the U.S. and has really been the focal point for the industry's recovery since the downturn in 2014. Today, H&P has 107 rigs operating in this region and we have a leading market share of over 20%, which we expect to grow further over the next several quarters.","The tightness of labor in the Permian is well-documented, but our attention to work for staffing during the downturn, as well as the quality reputation H&P has earned as an employer is enabling us to attract and retain experienced individuals, build high-performing crews that are focused on safety and put rigs to work quickly.","Strengthening crude oil prices have also been encouraging for International and Offshore markets, and we've started to see a long-awaited increase in the number of inquiries and bid opportunities in these segments. Juan Pablo will provide additional context to this improvements during his prepared remarks.","Well complexity defined by longer laterals and tighter well spacing is underscoring the importance of the quality and placement of a wellbore for the success of our customers' operations. As a result, our subsidiaries, MOTIVE and MagVAR, which remain at the technological forefront for these capabilities, are experiencing impressive growth in activity.","A few examples of expansion during the past quarter is MOTIVE's rig activity has doubled to approximately 28 rigs and approximately 40% of their activity is on FlexRigs. They also announced in March that they achieved an industry-leading 5 million feet of guided wellbore and with the increased activity are already nearing 6 million feet in total. MagVAR's activity has improved by 25% during the quarter and they corrected surveys on more than 800 wells.","While MOTIVE and MagVAR will continue to operate independently with a variety of rig contractors and directional drillers, these technology offerings, combined with our digital FlexRig platform, are a significant value-add for our customers that clearly are being recognized.","In fact, as an example, both companies collaborated on the FlexRig platform and helped deliver record well performance in both the Midland and Delaware Basin for several operators during the last quarter. We believe this collaboration creates a path towards automation.","Our ongoing effort to provide the right rig for our customers from our family of solutions enables H&P to serve a wider segment of the market and further enhances our market share. As we've seen in other industries, as complexity grows, combining the best equipment with the best technology creates an unmatched competitive advantage. We believe these competitive advantages will serve us well, both now and in the future.","And I will now turn the call over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I will expand on some of the announced information on each of our three drilling segments, followed by some comments on corporate-level details.","On our U.S. Land drilling segment, let me first highlight some of the details related to our growth in activity during the last few months. Since the last earnings call on January 25, 2018, our activity has increased by 10 rigs. The Permian again led the way, with a 5 rig increase. The Eagle Ford followed with a 4 rig increase, along with other minor up and down movements in other basins.","Our three most active basins today are the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the SCOOP and STACK play. As John mentioned, the Permian remains our most active operation with 107 rigs contracted. In the Eagle Ford and SCOOP and STACK today, we have 35 and 30 rigs contracted, respectively. We still have 47 idle FlexRigs in the Permian, 26 of which have 1,500 horsepower drawworks ratings. We also have 30 idle FlexRigs in the Eagle Ford, 29 of which have 1,500 horsepower drawworks rating.","As for the overall U.S. Land segment results corresponding to the second fiscal quarter, we exited the period with 213 contracted rigs and had an increase of approximately 4% in the number of active rigs quarter-to-quarter. We continued to experience growth in activity from beginning to end of the quarter, and now expect an even higher increase through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018.","Increasingly favorable market conditions continue to allow pricing improvements that more than offset the decreasing proportion of rigs under long-term contracts that were priced years ago during strong markets and that continued to roll off during the second fiscal quarter.","We also experienced a higher level of revenue from auxiliary services or what we have also referred to in the past as ancillary services. As a result, the adjusted average rig revenue per day increased by $544 to $22,711 for the quarter. Auxiliary or ancillary services provided to our customers include trucking, casing running tools, other equipment rentals, additional crew members, et cetera. The average rig expense per day increased by $540 to $14,086, which is generally in line with previously stated expectations.","Looking ahead at the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect a sequential increase of roughly 7% in the quarterly number of revenue days. Compared to the second quarter at $22,711 per day, we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to increase to approximately $23,000. The expected increase is primarily related to wage increases in the Permian that are effectively absorbed by our customers through day rate adjustments. We expect the underlying dynamics of new-build term contract roll offs to continue to at least partially offset increasing spot pricing.","Although our average day rate in the spot market remains in the high teen and now only slightly under $20,000, leading-edge super-spec FlexRig pricing is in the low to mid-20s. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to approximately $14,400. The expected increase is primarily driven by the mentioned wage increases in the Permian.","The normalized average rig expense per day directly related to rigs working in the U.S. Land segment was only a couple of percentage points over $13,000 during the second quarter, mostly as a result of expenses related to growing revenues for auxiliary services. As we also include the impact of the Permian wage increase, the average expense per day for rigs that are actually working is now expected to increase to roughly $13,500 per day going forward. This estimate excludes the impact of expenses directly related to inactive rigs and upfront reactivation expenses related to rigs that have been idle for a significant amount of time.","We had an average of 119.5 active rigs under term contract during the second quarter. 128 of our 216 contracted rigs today are under term contracts. And 33 of the 128 rigs under term contracts were priced during strong markets before the 2014 downturn. The remaining rigs under term contracts were priced since the downturn and have a remaining average duration of less than one year.","The expected average rig margin per day for all of our rigs already under term contracts in this segment during the third fiscal quarter is roughly $10,200 for an average of 124.5 rigs. The expected average rig margin per day numbers for rigs already under term contracts for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, for all of fiscal 2019, and for all of fiscal 2020 are roughly $10,500, $11,500, and $14,500, respectively.","The average number of corresponding rigs that we already have under term contracts for each of those three time periods is approximately as follows: 103 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, 52 for fiscal 2019, and 11 for fiscal 2020. No early termination notices for rigs under long-term contracts in this segment have been received since mid-2016, but given prior terminations, we expect to generate approximately $2 million during the third fiscal quarter and a total of approximately $3 million during the following two quarters in early termination revenues.","Let me now transition to our Offshore Operations. We had five rigs contracted through the quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by $2,871 to $9,504. The greater than expected decline was driven by self-insurance expense adjustments in the quarter. Management contracts contributed approximately $5 million to operating income.","As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2018, quarterly revenue days are expected to increase by approximately 15% as one previously idle rig is returning to work during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $10,500 during the quarter. Management contracts are expected to contribute approximately $4 million to $5 million to the quarter's operating income.","Moving on to our International Land Operations, as expected, the number of quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 4%. The average rig margin per day in this segment decreased by $2,818 to $8,533. The decline was lower, that is more favorable, than expected considering non-recurring items included in the prior quarter and better than expected performance during the second fiscal quarter.","As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2018, quarterly revenue days are expected to increase by about 5% to 10% as three rigs in Colombia are scheduled to return to work during the third fiscal quarter. Accordingly, we expect to end the quarter with 20 active rigs in the segment, including 16 in Argentina, three in Colombia and one in Bahrain. The average rig margin per day is expected to be approximately $9,000.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. We have been pleased to see an increasing level of activity and continued opportunities to upgrade FlexRigs to super-spec capacity and have adjusted our CapEx estimates, accordingly, during the last few months to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. Roughly 40% of that estimated range is attributable to maintenance CapEx, including tubulars.","Our balance sheet, liquidity level and term contract backlog remains strong and provide great flexibility to pursue plenty of opportunities, while at the same time sustaining current dividend levels. Our increasing CapEx level, along with corresponding FlexRig upgrades, resulted in some adjustments to our depreciation estimates for fiscal 2018. Depreciation is expected to increase by approximately 2% to $550 million, plus roughly $35 million in abandonments primarily related to super-spec FlexRig upgrades. The total depreciation estimate of $585 million compares to an original estimate of $560 million, including roughly $20 million in abandonment charges.","Our general and administrative expenses for the second fiscal quarter were higher than expected, primarily as a result of a greater level of resources and initiatives in support of our increasingly differentiated offering. We believe that there is great value in enhancing our organizational capabilities and promoting innovation and applied technology. We now expect fiscal 2018 G&A expenses to be approximately $190 million.","As mentioned in the press release, we made a slight and favorable adjustment to our deferred income tax liability, as we continue to work on the impact of the new federal income tax law. As we mentioned last quarter, the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate for our 2018 fiscal year, given our September 30 year end, is approximately 25%, and is expected to move to 21% for our 2019 fiscal year.","In addition to those statutory rates, of course, there are state and foreign income taxes to consider. It is not useful to provide an overall income tax rate estimate for fiscal 2018, given that income before taxes is expected to be a relatively small number. Nevertheless, and as also mentioned during the last quarter's call, we would not be surprised to have a total blended statutory income tax rate of around 25% during fiscal 2019 and beyond.","Let me now turn the call back to John.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Pablo. The market for super-spec rigs remains very tight. We believe the available super-spec fleet is effectively at 100% utilization, and the industry super-spec capable fleet, which includes both upgraded and readily upgradable rigs, is over 80% utilized. And this high level of utilization should continue to drive higher day rates.","As we discussed on our January call, our return requirements for FlexRig super-spec upgrades require a 12 to 24-month term contract and day rates in the low to mid-$20,000 range. We have been investing significant capital in upgrading our FlexRigs since the fall of 2016, along with also investing in the capabilities of our operational support services for the purpose of delivering even higher value to our customers. As we move forward, our expectation is that our super-spec FlexRigs, including those in the spot market, will have day rates in the low to mid-$20,000 range within the next few months.","Before opening the call for Q&A, I would like to acknowledge that this will be Juan Pablo's last call as CFO of H&P. And everyone at H&P would like to extend our blessings and thanks for his contributions to the company for the past 16 years. For those of you that followed the company before JP, we call him JP around here, not Juan Pablo, before JP took over as the IR director, you would remember the lower profile IR effort we had 13 years ago. Juan Pablo took that effort and transformed it into a key differentiator that has been recognized as industry-leading and award-winning.","He took over as CFO in 2010 and has been at the helm during one of the company's most prolific growth spurts. Those were fun times, and equally prolific industry collapse. Through it all, he provided a steady hand. JP, we appreciate your leadership and we appreciate the tone that you set for employees, the IR community and long-term shareholders. We wish nothing but the best for you and your family as you set out on this new journey. So, thank you very much. We appreciate that.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you very, very much, John. Very much appreciate that.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","And, Erika, we'll now turn the call over to you to open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to the line of Byron Pope from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Byron.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Juan Pablo, I'm sure you'll obviously be missed there at Helmerich & Payne, but those of us on the sell side will also miss you. You're a good man, so congratulations on your retirement.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you very much, Byron. Very much appreciated.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","John, just one question for you, as we think about the Permian market, and you guys have the leading market share, obviously, and so you made a comment about expecting to continue to grow your market share over time. And it makes sense, given that you've got the lion's share of the idle and super-spec capacity there, upgradeable to super-spec capacity in the basin. But could you just speak to \u2013 as you have your customer conversations in the basin, do you see that customer mix shifting more toward the larger independents or maybe some of the smaller? Just speak to the customer mix, how you think that evolves in the Permian as you place incremental rigs?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Sure. Byron, I think one of the things \u2013 and you've heard us say this several times, the only good thing about a downturn that I can see is it gives you an opportunity to work for a lot of customers that you didn't previously have the opportunity to work with. And I think we have 70 customers today in U.S. Land, which is more than we had at the peak in 2014 when we had 300 rigs running. And so I think, really, it's going be a combination of both, I think, fortunately for us. We're seeing our traditional customers, and they're adding rigs, but we're also seeing a lot of new companies, smaller companies, companies that previously didn't have access to FlexRig technology, and in some cases, didn't really need the FlexRig technology because the types of wells that they were drilling then versus the types of wells we're drilling today.","So, I see it as a great opportunity to continue to grow. And as you've heard us, again, talk about for years, it's not just the rig, it's not just having a super-spec classification rig, it's also the organizational support structure that we have built at H&P that we've spent a lot of time and effort to construct, to support performance in the field and to provide the highest levels of value that we can for our customers. So, I think that also gives us a good competitive advantage. And particularly, as you think about some of the smaller companies that haven't invested as much in new technology, because \u2013 either because they're just smaller or because they just don't have the resources and the STACK to do that. So, I think that gives us an opportunity as well.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Appreciate the color. Thanks, John.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Colin Davies from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, let me echo Byron's comments. Juan Pablo, it's been great working with you and wish you all the very best for a very long and happy retirement.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you so much. Colin.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just talking about the CapEx guidance, the CapEx guidance obviously moved up steadily as the pace of upgrades continued. If I work through the pace so far, it seems like the upgrade is about 80% still the cheaper, skiddable upgrades. Is that a fair comment?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","We certainly have upgraded more rigs with skidding packages than with walking rigs. We have upgraded more walking rigs this fiscal year as compared to last year. And so, the rate of increase there is encouraging. We're seeing demand. We expect to continue to gain market share with that type of offering.","As we move forward, as we've mentioned in the past, it's been good to see the 30 that we have upgraded so far. In the past, we've mentioned that we were more or less expecting a cadence of 12 per quarter. I think we continue more or less in that direction, but most importantly, well prepared to react to a potentially greater level of demand and be able to put more rigs out. And so, our CapEx level remains flexible at this time. Certainly, expect to be in that range, but if conditions improve, that CapEx estimate might continue to increase going forward.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. And just as a follow-on, if we expect that cadence of around 30 through the first half of the fiscal year to continue through the second half for the \u2013 against the CapEx, but the percentage of the walkables to go up, is the CapEx likely to creep up against that?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I'd hesitate to give you a firm answer on that because we do have some assumptions related to that. Competitively speaking, we prefer not to provide that level of granularity. But to your point, I think that we will have a continuing level of increase in demand for walking upgrades. But at the end of the year, we certainly expect to have more skidding upgrades than walking upgrades.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Colin, I might add a little additional color that we talked about on the last call that's still valid today, which is what we want to avoid is overbuilding that super-spec capacity. And so, while we're projecting the amount of rigs we're going to add per quarter, we're assuming that there's going to continue to be high levels of demand for that type of rig. I don't see it. I don't see that that demand goes away, but that's one of the things to make certain that we keep in sight as well.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","And just to give you a sense, this is Juan Pablo, if I may add to that. About a third of the 30 upgrades, probably a little under a third, have been walking rigs, and then more than two thirds skidding package upgrades.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful, Juan Pablo. Thank you. Is there any difference in where the walkables are going? Are they still going into the Permian or are they going into other plays?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think just by virtue of the Permian being where the majority of the demand is and the draw is for super-spec rigs, most of those are going to Permian, but we do have them in other areas as well. We have some in the northeast. We have Haynesville. So, I mentioned Utica. Three or four in the Eagle Ford. So, there's definitely some demand pull. I want to say about half of them are probably going into the Permian.","Colin Davies - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you very much. I'll turn it back.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Tommy Moll from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning, Tommy.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","So, you said you think the market is about 80% utilized in terms of the current super-spec fleet, plus upgradable rigs. Where do you think that 80% needs to go before we get a next leg up in day rates to where we're firmly in the mid-20s?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, that's a great question. I'm not certain what the number is. I think if you look at, historically speaking, when \u2013 the utilization of the fleet, and I think in previous cycles, we would typically look at the overall fleet, available fleet, but clearly, this market has a bifurcation with super-spec capacity and that's where the demand is. And so, I think recognizing in past cycles when you reset 80% or so hurdle is when you really begin to see pricing power.","So, I think it's just a function of that and a function of time. I think we've mentioned on previous calls, coming out of a downturn, it's challenging to get rates moving off of the bottom, but in a stronger environment, it's obviously a little bit easier. I think the other thing for us that we continue to drive home internally and externally is, not only are we investing a lot of dollars, a lot of capital, we're also providing very high levels of value for customers. And I think that's the part that we have to make certain that we don't lose sight of. And so, our experience is, customers are willing to pay for that value proposition.","So, I know it's not a direct answer to your question because I don't have the exact timing or answer, can't go into a whole lot on the strategy behind our pricing strategy in general, but we recognize that pricing needs to improve.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And if I could ask one follow-up. I wanted to talk about the daily OpEx for the U.S. fleet. Did I hear correctly in the prepared remarks that the primary driver of the increase, both in the past quarter and in the current quarter, is related to labor, particularly in the Permian? And also, do you have any visibility into when, at the gross profit level, we could get back into the $9,000 a day range? Thanks.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Tommy, this is Juan Pablo. The expected increase from the second quarter to the third fiscal quarter, which would be a little over \u2013 I guess, a little under $14,100 to approximately $14,400, that difference is driven primarily by wage increases in the Permian. The wage increases did not apply until the beginning of this third fiscal quarter, so that does not apply to the difference that we spoke about or the transition between Q1 and Q2.","So, I think that addresses your first question. Of course, let me also clarify that those increases in our total expenses are, in essence, passed through to the customer, through day rate adjustments. And so, as we mentioned during our comments, we expect the increase in average rig revenue per day to also be affected by this wage increase.","As relates to your second question, we do not provide guidance into future quarters other than the immediately-following quarter, which would be, in this case, the third fiscal quarter; so, I cannot answer your question directly. What we try to do is provide the foundation of all the information that anybody would require to model, accordingly. And depending on what somebody's assumptions might be related to continued improvement in pricing or activity, that allows the analyst to be able to come up with average margin expectations during the next two, three years and the corresponding quarters, of course.","So, do we think that that is possible? Absolutely. I mean, we've been at much higher levels in the past and we hope that continuing market improvements, as we have seen and continue to see, may certainly drive to that. We're encouraged with the continued pricing increases in the spot market and, as John mentioned, the expected acceleration, given tightening market conditions. So, we're very pleased to see that, and we see that as very favorable in terms of the rest of the year.","Tommy Moll - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you. That's all for me.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Michael Lamotte from Guggenheim.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. And, Juan Pablo, let me also offer my congratulations. You're going to be missed.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you so much, Michael. Appreciate that.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Of course. And the question, John, is on rig performance. If I look at prior cycles, rig performance is largely measured by ROP and the reduction in days per well. And rightly or wrongly, you and your peers were often criticized for not capturing that value because day rates generally reflected new build costs for rigs. As the definition of rig performance shifts from efficiency more towards wellbore quality and placement, how does HP protect itself from losing sort of the value capture there and better insulate itself and share the value capture more effectively with the customer?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Michael, that's a great question. No doubt the day rate model and the performance that we've seen over the last five years has been impressive. We do have different business models that we're looking at; obviously, not in a position to talk in great deal with that. But I think the facts are, there's still a lot of opportunity on the drilling side, on the ROP and the days per well. Now, not in any basin. Some basins that \u2013 use the Eagle Ford as an example, we've been drilling horizontal wells there for a long, long time and it's a very fast drilling environment. But in other areas, and Permian being one of them, there's still a lot of opportunity.","So, I think the combination of high ROP, lower days per well, in combination with higher levels of wellbore quality, less tortuosity, better wellbore placement combined together is very \u2013 I think is very important. I think, overall, as an industry, there's not a great recognition overall of just wellbore quality and placement in terms of actual. So, I think that's an opportunity.","So, I hear your question and not a direct answer that I can provide here, but we do recognize it and see it as an opportunity.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And I think that's \u2013 opportunity versus risk, I think, is sort of the key differentiating point there, because I think it is an opportunity to price a service that's effectively separate and discrete from day rate, whether it's performance or fixed fee, whatever.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Right.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","It'll be interesting to see how that unfolds. As a quick follow-up, or maybe it's not so quick, I don't know, on the International green shoots, can you speak a little bit more specifically about where and order of magnitude?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Michael, most of the immediate opportunities, International, that we see are in South America. Argentina, no surprise to anyone, is probably the number one opportunity, in terms of sending additional FlexRig3s into Argentina. I think that's a great opportunity for this, this year and into 2019. Colombia is a great opportunity in terms of getting rigs back to work, get them reactivated. I'm not quite as clear on if there's great opportunities to send additional rigs into Colombia. I think we still have a little bit of time to go there. There are some Middle East opportunities, but at least our experience, and you've probably seen it as well, is those opportunities take a very long time to materialize, and we see opportunities, but it's really hard to see \u2013 well, I think we can safely say that's not going to happen in 2018. It would be a 2019 event at least for H&P.","Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, appreciate it. Thanks.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to the line of Blake Hancock from Howard Weil.","K. Blake Hancock - Scotia Howard Weil","Thank you. Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning Blake.","K. Blake Hancock - Scotia Howard Weil","John, maybe first, can we talk about the activity increases? You're maintaining kind of the same cadence of upgrades. On the 12 rigs kind of that we're net adding here in this quarter and going forward, can you talk about the visibility? Are those all net in your opinion to the rig count or are they kind of replacing competitors' rigs either from performance or because you do have this super-spec? Just trying to couch that for us on what you're seeing?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. It's interesting because the rig count's up, what, 80 or 90 rigs, I think it's 80 rigs this year, this calendar year. And we have actually seen a slight increase in some of the legacy rigs that may be as a result of \u2013 I think, it's primarily SCR rigs, being able to go to work because we can't provide \u2013 the overall industry can't provide enough AC rigs to satisfy demand.","I think what you've described is, no surprise, it's a mix. I think we see examples where we're adding a rig or two to a customer's \u2013 or in some cases even more than a rig or two to a customer's overall fleet. In other cases, we are replacing lower-performing rigs. And then, the question then becomes that rig that gets replaced, where does it go? And depending on the quality of that rig, it may end up bumping additional rigs. But in a flat, kind of a flattish outlook, even with the rig count fairly flat, I think you still see high-quality rigs, super-spec rigs coming in and displacing some lower tier rigs and they ultimately would fall off the bottom.","Now, if the rig count needs to grow another 80 to 100 rigs through the rest of the year, then I think the industry will be responding with whatever we can bring to market. Obviously, for H&P, we're very well-positioned in that we can respond with AC drive super-spec rigs and others will have to go a different route.","K. Blake Hancock - Scotia Howard Weil","That's perfect. And then to follow-up on the International questions or the commentary, do you view those Latin American opportunities still in 2018 or \u2013 we're already halfway through the year, would that be more 2019? Kind of help us with the timing there and maybe from the magnitude of the number of rigs that you could see added potentially.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think if we can make it happen \u2013 well, we could make it happen, I think, in this calendar year, probably not in this fiscal year in terms of rigs moving out of the U.S. to \u2013 say, as an example, to Argentina. I think we do reactivate additional rigs in South America this fiscal year, but in terms of getting additional rigs into country, that's probably at least a \u2013 I would imagine, a six month type of effort. So, it would be towards the back half of this year and then hopefully into 2019.","K. Blake Hancock - Scotia Howard Weil","That's great. Thank you, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, morning, everyone.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Morning, Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And Juan Pablo, best of luck in your next steps. Really appreciate all the insights over the years.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you very much, Sean. Appreciate that.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So just a couple smaller items here. Just thinking about your contracted day rates in the fleet today, just how much dispersion would you say there is in your book of contracts? And then just thinking about the upgrades that are \u2013 I'm sorry, the new contracts on upgraded rigs, 12 to 24 months, are the rates firm or are we building any ratchet provisions in either direction for those contracts?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Sean. This is Juan Pablo. Yeah, we have a wide array of rigs under term contracts in the U.S. Land segment. As I mentioned during my comments, I think we have a little over 30 of rigs that are still legacy type rigs, meaning new build type rigs that we contracted \u2013 that we've secured pricing on, at least, before the downturn in 2014. And the rest of the term contracts were negotiated after the downturn. Those have less than a year duration, on average, remaining. We'll see some favorable impact from the roll off of those contracts negotiated after the downturn because, obviously, we expect those to be rolling off of those term contracts and going into higher day rates.","So, that is great. We're pleased with that. In general, we're pleased with the overall trajectory, even though the average rig margin and average rig revenue per day has been coming down for rigs under term contract. As a result, that is a result of great news and that we continue to contract rigs at higher than spot pricing, as John mentioned. When we upgrade rigs, we put those rigs to work in the low to mid-20s. Many of them, if not all, are under term contracts. And so, those term contracts continue to get better and better.","In terms of the new contracts having fixed day rates, I believe that most of those new term contracts have fixed day rates. There may be a few that have some fluctuation, depending on certain variables, some performance-driven contracts. I'm not prepared to comment on those. I'm not sure if we have many of those. John, you may have a (48:29).","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah. I think there may be some performance upside on some and there may be some oil price metrics, (48:37) as well, but that's a very small number. In general, they're kind of a standard term contract provision.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. No, that's very helpful. Thank you for that feedback. And maybe just thinking about capital allocation, right now, you're focused on capturing market share, meeting customer needs, which make sense, and obviously, you've been executing well. So, near-term looks promising, but I guess the further out we go, certainly there's more uncertainty. So, looking forward, I'm just curious if any updated thoughts on how you see cash flow progressing towards dividend coverage and how you think about balancing growth versus dividend coverage in your capital allocation?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Sean. This is Juan Pablo again. As we've mentioned before, we are optimistic in terms of the trajectory of market conditions during the next year, and actually, during the next few years. And so, as we look at how our cash flow of generation potential might evolve and what our CapEx level might be, and of course, the current liquidity level that we have, we're pleased to see that we are prepared to \u2013 and in good position to continue to sustain the dividend and potentially even increase it as we have for so many years on an annual basis.","On the other hand, we have great flexibility not only to continue pay the dividend but to pursue a significant amount of opportunities through capital allocation, through growing the business. Obviously, what we've been focusing on so far over the last few years are upgrades, but who knows what other opportunities might emerge. Of course, we've acquired two technology companies that complements our offering very, very well. As we move forward, we don't think that we are capital-restrained. We have a great balance sheet that we can tap into. And given the right opportunity, we'll be glad to do so. So, very pleased to see our position in that regard and only favorable expectations as we move forward in terms of the possibilities.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, Sean, I couldn't agree more. I think we're in a great place and looking forward to continuing to grow the business. And again, hopefully, there's some additional opportunities for acquisitions in the technology space that we'll see.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. That's all fair. Thank you very much.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Marc Bianchi from Cowen & Company.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Hi, Marc?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Hi, Marc. Are you there?","Operator","Marc, your line is open. And looks like he may have left the queue. So, we'll go next to the line of Tom Curran from B. Riley FBR.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning. Tom.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Good morning. Tom.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hey, Juan Pablo, please add my voice to this call's chorus. Thanks for everything and all the best.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Tom. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","John, I just want to try to put some crisper fine-tuning around how you believe the super-spec market has evolved. So, if we were to go back to the end of fiscal 2017, you put the total industry super-spec fleet at that time at around 400 total industry potential upgrades at 250 and then HP with over 100 eligible upgrades. It sounds as if now you estimate that the total industry fleet has grown to it sounds like around 445 and that we know HP has upgraded 30. Does that mean that the rest of the industry, since September 30, has essentially added just about 15 rigs?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Does that \u2013 that sounds low to me.","Dave Wilson - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, it sounds \u2013 yeah, I think \u2013 I'm not sure. Tom, are you talking from December year end or from September 30?","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","I'm talking from September 30, right? So that's what you highlight in the press release, right? That since October 1, you've added 30 upgraded super-spec rigs to the industry super-spec fleet. Correct?","Dave Wilson - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Correct. And then, so others in the industry have also added as well. But as we said before, their capacity to add as many as ours isn't as great. So, you're seeing less adds to the super-spec classification from them versus \u2013 compared to us.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","That makes sense.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Tom, this is Juan Pablo. If I may add, conceptually, I think your assumption is in the ballpark in terms of what we've seen and that is that H&P continues to upgrade rigs to super-spec capacity at a much greater rate than anybody else can because of the availability of rigs that we have to do that as compared to others that are, as Dave just mentioned, very limited.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Okay. And I can take this offline with Dave after the call to try to fine tune these numbers. I just want to make sure I was in the ballpark. John, you mentioned how the collaboration progress occurring between HP's Center of Excellence and broader digital platform in MOTIVE and MagVAR is creating a path towards automation. What would be the next major steps, technologically, on the path to automation, both on the hardware and the software sides? And at this point, does it seem as if you're more likely to pursue those steps, the internal R&D, additional acquisitions or a combination?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Well, Tom, I think with the current \u2013 with MOTIVE and MagVAR and our current capability, I think there's a lot of the steps of automation are there. You probably heard us say that automation is a iterative step. It's not entirely unlike the autonomous vehicles where you don't remove the steering wheel in step one or two. It's step six or seven down the path.","And so, I think we are in that position with the capacity to get to the point where we're automating more of the functions that are today done by human. That, of course, will enhance reliability, will enhance performance in a pretty large way. So, I think we have that capacity internal. The question is how does that automation package change and, over time, based on what kind of demands customers have? I think that's ultimately the question, which would address the what other technologies do you need. I think where we are right now, we feel pretty good about where we are.","Thomas Curran - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate the answers, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Chase Mulvehill with Wolfe Research.","Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Juan Pablo, enjoy retirement. Hopefully, you get to move south and get to spend some time in some warmer weather.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right. Thank you, sir. I look forward to that, Chase. Appreciate it.","Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC","I guess, the first question kind of on super-spec, if we think about what's driving customer demand for super-spec, if you had to rank it in order of importance, would it be wellbore quality, rate of penetration or lateral length?","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I think the lateral length and the rate of penetration, as well as pad capability, are the primary drivers for super-spec rigs. The average lateral, I believe, is around 8,000, maybe a little over 8,000. I think that's where you begin to see the traditional 5,000-psi mud-pumping system kind of get to the point of being maxed out. And so, that's when you need to really have 7500-psi. And your rate of penetration drops off, your risk associated with getting stuck because you can't circulate the well like you should be able to. And then, the other piece is, like I said, the pad capability. Those rigs, if designed right and run properly, you're lowering risk and you're enhancing reliability associated with the offering.","The other portion that you mentioned, Chase, as far as wellbore quality, that probably isn't talked about as much as what I think it will be going forward. And so, I think that's one of the things we're really excited about with MOTIVE and MagVAR is the ability to work with customers to not only drill highly-reliable, high ROP wells, lower-cost wells, but also do it with better wellbore quality and better placement.","Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. That's great color. Appreciate all that. I guess, one quick follow-up, since we're a little bit over the hour. Your rig count today, I didn't see that in the press release anywhere. Could you give us the rig count today and kind of where you think it'll end the quarter?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","So, you're talking about our U.S. Land segment, Chase?","Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC","Sorry. Sorry. Yes, U.S. Land.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","I believe we are at 216. And what we mentioned is that we \u2013 I think we're excited about, of course, a 7% increase quarter-to-quarter in terms of revenue days. What that would suggest is an average close to 220 rigs for the third fiscal quarter, and hopefully, an exit number that is closer to 230 or between 225 to 230. So hopefully, that helps.","Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC","That helps. All righty. We'll turn it over.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","All right. Well, thank you very much, everybody. I think we are out of time. So, we'll turn the call back to John for some closing remarks.","John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Yeah, just real quickly. Again, thank you all for attending. I wanted to, first of all, thank our people for their commitment and focus on safety and driving high level of performance for customers. You heard us say before. We think we're very well positioned to continue to grow the business by upgrading our FlexRigs to super-spec. We're going to continue to invest in our support services, going to continue to innovate to drive new technology that are differentiating and add value to our customers. So, thank you again.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to the Vice President and CFO of Helmerich & Payne, Mr. Juan Pablo Tardio. Please go ahead.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Priscilla, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Hans Helmerich, Chairman and CEO; and John Lindsay, President and COO. As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to Hans Helmerich.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the results of another record quarter announced this morning. I'll leave it to John to describe the particulars highlighted by our securing an impressive number of 35 fully contracted new build orders since the beginning of our current fiscal year last October 1. In light of this being my last earnings call prior to my retirement as CEO in March, I hope you will indulge me in a few personal comments.","On each of these calls, we receive a list of names that are signed on and will participate in our Q&A session. And I'm really taken back by how many of you I have known for a good number of years and have developed friendships with. I spoke at my FirstEnergy conference and started engaging with investors over 25 years ago. Those were simpler times. It was way before PowerPoint presentations and webcasts, and more than once I was on the phone trying to secure us a slot in the program. Today, we have 27 analysts that cover us, and we can't attend all the conference invitations that we would like to.","The process has changed a lot. The level of engagement, the amount of information and sophistication has all dialed way up. In many ways, it seems your jobs have gotten a lot tougher. But behind all the changes, over the years, some of the fundamental drivers do remain the same. One of the basic building blocks for successful investing is establishing a working knowledge of management and understanding how they think, where they want to take the business, how they intend to spend the owner's capital and the manner in which they will exercise their duty of care over the company's resources. How will they shape the culture and establish the tone at the top? What level of talent will they surround themselves with, and how deep is the organization's bench strength [ph]?","I get it that these things don't matter to everybody, but to many of the names on this call, they matter a lot. And the answers don't just pop off the computer screen or always reveal themselves through the financial modeling. The answers come out the old fashion way. Having frank conversations with management, asking the tough questions, applying the right amount of skepticism at times, requiring proof, testing for trustworthiness, validating the execution and then tracking the results.","I've seen the rigor of the process up close and have a huge respect for the hard work that it requires. At the end of the day, you're trying to answer the million dollar question. Do I want to recommend you guys to my clients? Do I want to own you? Can you deliver the real, long-term value going forward? So all of this is to set up and say a couple of things.","Thanks for your engagement with us. It's helped make us a better company. And as I look back, it's certainly made me a better manager. Thanks for scrubbing through the numbers, for visiting our rigs, for touring our manufacturing facilities, for making that pilgrimage to Tulsa, talking to our customers, suppliers and peers. Thanks for digging hard for the answers to your questions.","Will I miss all this, the one-on-ones, the non-deal roadshows, the tours, the conferences? It's not a rhetorical question. I've been honored to be the company's chief spokesman, knowing all the while, the more compelling case for the company was made when you guys went out and met our folks in the field, our rig managers, superintendents, interacted with our management team and any one of the thousands of H&P employees that make us the world's best at what we do.","It's never been lost on us that we work for you, the owners of the company. That won't change. So while you'll see me around in my ongoing role as Chairman, I'll miss the direct engagement. The relationships, the mutual respect and the personal friendships that are forged over the years of working together, sharing meals and getting to know one another.","Let me close with one of those quintessential questions we often hear from investors. It usually follows the question, \"what didn't I ask that I should have?\" And it goes like this. What about the company, do you not think Wall Street and investors fully appreciate? The short answer has been the same for a long time. It is the strength of our culture and the quality of our people. Their loyalty, hard work and buying into our values help drive our quest for a sustainable advantage over our peers and our ability to drive measurable value to our customers.","Our value proposition breaks down this way: 1\/3 grade iron, 2\/3 organizational excellence. We're a 94-year-old company, and I've had the rare opportunity of pledging my best efforts to my grandfather, the Founder, when I started work with the company. Then I had the great pleasure to work for over 30 years with my dad.","During my 25th year as CEO, it's satisfying to manage the succession effort that will build on our successful track record. John Lindsay is the right leader for the company's next chapter. I have full confidence in him and our management team, and has never felt better about the future of the company.","Over the next 35 days, I'll have a chance to express my appreciation to coworkers, some of our customers, suppliers and others. But here's a sincere thanks to you, for your support and confidence.","Juan Pablo, I'm going to turn the call back to you.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you very much, Hans. The company reported a quarterly record level of $264 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We also reported record revenue levels at $889 million for the quarter. Given the announced new FlexRig commitments from customers and our increased rig construction cadence to approximately 3 per month beginning in April, we now expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 to total approximately $950 million. Approximately 60% of this estimate corresponds to our new build program, 30% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to other projects. We expect at this point to be able to fully fund our fiscal 2014 CapEx program, as well as other scheduled commitments from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities during the fiscal year.","We are pleased to have seen a significant increase in the number of term contract commitments from customers. The average number of rigs that we already have under term contracts for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2014 is now 160, and the average number for all of fiscal 2015 is now 106 rigs. About 90% of these rigs correspond to our U.S. land segment and provide the company with the benefit of an average pricing level that is still about 5% to 10% higher than current spot market pricing. Moreover, as some of our rigs that are under term contracts roll off of these term contracts, and as announced, new builds are deployed under new term contracts for new builds, we expect the average pricing of remaining rigs on term to slightly increase during fiscal 2014.","Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations during the fiscal quarter was reported at approximately 34.1%, that's for the first fiscal quarter. And accordingly, we now expect the effective income tax rate for the rest of the fiscal year to be between 34% and 35%. As it relates to our investment portfolio, the holdings remain unchanged compared to the prior quarter.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning to everyone on the call. We have long believed the legacy rig replacement cycle in the U.S. would last for many years, and we see today it continues to gain strength. Since the peak of activity in 2008, when AC drive rigs had a 15% market share, AC drive technology has continued to capture market share through the cycle.","Today, with AC drive rigs commanding 41% market share in the U.S., which is approximately 700 active rigs, the outlook for AC drive rig growth remains positive. Not only our old conventional SCR mechanical rigs challenged to keep up in the world of unconventional resource plays because of horizontal well complexity, in addition to complexity, well depths and the lateral length continue to increase and customer expectations for drilling performance and safety are elevated to new levels.","Those are among the many reasons we believe H&P, with its industry leader FlexRig, is well-positioned to continue to take market share in the U.S., as well as in international markets in the future. As customers increasingly differentiate between efficiencies among service providers, H&P continues to demonstrate a tangible value delivered by our people, technology and systems.","Now I will discuss our results for each of our operating segments, beginning with the U.S. land segment, where operating income increased by $15.1 million sequentially to $251 million. Revenue days increased over 4%, representing approximately 255 average active rigs in the first fiscal quarter as compared to 245 rigs active in the prior quarter. An average of approximately 157 rigs operated under term contracts, while an average of approximately 98 rigs were active in the spot market.","Excluding early termination revenue, average rig revenue per day was in line with our expectations, and decreased by $275 in the fourth fiscal quarter to $28,046 per day in the first fiscal quarter. Average rig expense per day decreased by $704 sequentially to $12,934 per day. Also excluding early termination revenue, average rig margin per day increased by $429 to $15,112 per day for the first quarter.","As the U.S. land market improves, we are encouraged by increasing customer demand for new FlexRigs. We have announced 35 new AC drive FlexRigs since the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year, and 22 since our last earnings call in November. The 35 new rigs were contracted with 9 exploration and production companies. Seven of the new rigs were delivered in the first fiscal quarter of 2014, 6 have been delivered in January and we expect the remaining 22 rigs to be delivered in fiscal 2014. A few additional details on the 35 new builds: 23 are FlexRig3s, 11 Flex 5s and 1 Flex 4; 70% of the new FlexRigs have skid systems for pad drilling. The rigs are scheduled to work in the following basins: 16 in the Permian, 8 in Oklahoma, 4 in the Eagle Ford, 2 each in the Bakken and Utica, 1 each in the Haynesville, Niobrara and Woodbine.","We plan to continue our FlexRig new build cadence of 2 rigs per month through the end of March and then increase the cadence to 3 rigs per month beginning in April through the end of the fiscal year. We benefit greatly by having the ability to adjust our cadence of new builds in response to market demand and by using accumulated capital spares to quickly respond to market demand, all at a reasonable cost.","Today, our U.S. land fleet attained another all-time high level of 269 contracted rigs, including 155 under term contracts and 114 operating in the spot market. All active rigs are AC drive FlexRigs. Our U.S. land fleet utilization is 85%, with 46 idle rigs. However, our AC FlexRig utilization has improved to 95% with only 13 idle AC drive rigs today.","We remain the most active contractor in the 2 highest activity basins in the U.S., with 82 rigs in the Eagle Ford, which is approximately 35% of the market share, and 63 rigs in the Permian, which is approximately 15% market share.","We expect our second quarter operational outlook for our U.S. land segment to continue to improve assuming oil prices remain strong. Revenue days should increase by approximately 2% as compared to the first fiscal quarter. Excluding early termination revenues in the prior quarter, we expect the average rig revenue per day to be relatively flat during the second fiscal quarter. In addition, we do not expect any early termination revenues during the second fiscal quarter.","Our U.S. land operation has been an excellent job managing expenses, and I fully expect them to continue. However, I believe it is important to put in perspective the seasonality of the second fiscal quarter expense volatility we have experienced in the past. In addition to the seasonality, we also expect a higher than normal number of new build FlexRig activations, and relocating several existing rigs from basin to basin in order to meet customer demand.","With this in mind, we expect average rig expense per day to increase to slightly over $13,000 per day, plus potentially a few percentage points for quarterly expense volatility.","With regards to term contracts, we have already signed commitments for an average of 150 rigs during the second fiscal quarter of 2014, an average of 145 rigs for the remaining 3 quarters of 2014 and an average of 96 rigs for fiscal 2015.","We are pleased with the outlook of the U.S. land market as day rates continue to strengthen for both term contracts, as well as the spot market. And moving into the discussion of our offshore segment results, where operating income increased by approximately $8.2 million to $18.5 million as compared to prior quarter as a result of better average margins for active H&P rigs and greater operating income from management contracts.","Revenue days from our rigs remained unchanged sequentially at 736 days as utilization remained constant at 89% for the segment. Excluding the $6.4 million charge that negatively impacted our fourth fiscal quarter, average rig margin per day increased by $772 sequentially to $27,449 per day.","Our offshore outlook remains solid. As of today, we have 8 of our rigs active and 1 rig stacked. We expect 8 rigs to remain active through the second fiscal quarter of '14. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to decline by 2% with margins declining to approximately $26,000 per day. In addition, we expect operating income from management contracts to reduce from approximately $4 million to $2 million as compared with the first quarter.","As we look at future quarters, however, we do expect our offshore management contract operating income levels to be in the range closer to $6 million by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, as a result of new contracts. I'll now comment on our international land segment, where operating income decreased by approximately $1.1 million to $12.8 million.","Revenue days in our international segment decreased 7% to 2,156 days, as overall segment utilization decreased from 87% to 82% sequentially. Average rig margin per day decreased by $292 to $10,342 per day. As of today, the international land segment has 21 rigs working, 12 of which are AC drive FlexRigs. Of these active rigs, 8 are in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Colombia and 2 each are in Bahrain and UAE. A total of 8 rigs are idle in the following countries: we have 3 in Colombia, 2 in Tunisia, and 1 each in Argentina, Bahrain and Ecuador. As a result, we expect international land revenue days to decline by approximately 5% to 10%. We expect international margins to be relatively flat in the second fiscal quarter of '14 as compared to the previous quarter.","As we have mentioned previously, we believe the primary driving force behind international land expansion will be an increased global adoption of horizontal drilling in unconventional resource plays. Looking forward, we remain optimistic on long-term international growth opportunities.","In closing, and in the midst of an improving with market, and an increasingly competitive landscape for contractors, we are well-positioned with the industry's most capable fleet of AC drive land rigs. Our manufacturing capability allows us to grow our fleet at a faster rate than our competitors, and because of our customers continuously demonstrating their preference for our service offering, safety, performance and value proposition, we are able to deliver better returns for our shareholders.","This completes my operating segment remarks. And prior to turning the call back to Juan Pablo, I would like to recognize Hans for 25 exceptional years of service as CEO. On behalf of the 10,000 plus employees at H&P today, the thousands of H&P retirees and our Board of Directors, Hans, we want to thank you for your leadership and for the example you have set for us all. The great news for us, this isn't a good bye. We are pleased and very blessed that you'll remain as our Chairman, but this isn't a good bye, just an opportunity to write another chapter.","And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you very much, John. And Priscilla, we'll now open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from [indiscernible] Patel with Clarkson Capital Markets.","Unknown Analyst","And I guess if I could start by saying congratulations to Hans. You've been a classy man and a brilliant leader over the years. So I wish you all the best in your retirement.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thank you. I appreciate that.","Unknown Analyst","And I guess, turning to the business at hand. I'm sure you guys have noticed the move in gas prices. Are you starting to see an emergence of some demand from some heretofore sleepy basins? I did hear that, that there was 1 rig earmarked for the Haynesville, but maybe just a little more color around that.","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think it may be a little early for demand really to be responding in terms of incremental drilling to gas prices. You are seeing some hedging activity and some guys taking advantage of that. And that ends up being positive because it drives activity even if you'd have gas prices back off after the winter. Having said that, we're encouraged that gas prices have responded to cold weather, and we'd love to see the type of price levels be sustainable.","Unknown Analyst","Great news. I guess, on the accruing front, as you start to -- as you continue the growth in the fleet, could you speak a little bit to the dynamics there in terms of labor cost, escalation, prices and scarcity of putting good people on the rigs?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, John can add to this. We haven't seen a lot of labor cost pressure. I think our guys have done a great job over the years, and I go back -- we've had 2 different phases where we were in a 4 rig per month cadence. So we had the challenges of crewing up and training and bringing those guys up to a performance level where they hit the ground, satisfying the customer. So we have not only a great track record, but I think we've got a system that allows us to do that as we transition to 3 rigs per month. I think that will go smoothly, and our expectation is not really to have a bump in the road in that regard.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brad Handler with Jefferies.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Please let me echo my congratulations and best wishes, Hans, for your retirement.","Hans Christian Helmerich","I appreciate it, Brad.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","If I could turn to, I guess, I could turn to your new build orders, maybe some insights that you're deriving about the market from the 35. Do you have a sense as to what extent your -- the orders are for incremental rigs versus replacing, say, an SCR or even mechanical rig that's trying to do an operator's work today?","Hans Christian Helmerich","It's hard to draw a bright line between those 2. I think that it is a function of what you've heard us talk about where, as customers move into this development phase of their effort, they become more discriminating and maybe, another way to say it, less tolerant of underperforming older rigs. And so now, they have -- they are not doing delineation wells, and they're not doing drilling that holds leases. They really have a farsighted plan and that effort around, kind of a factory-type approach. And that just is a great match with having better equipment, having better organizational competency driving that effort and partnering with them to get the best efficiencies available. So that's our sense. It's hard for us to know, I think some will be incremental. But clearly, you think today, they're 700 plus SCR mechanical rigs still out there fighting for whatever is in their remaining life, and they're under the pressure that we help to bring with our AC rig offering.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. It makes sense. Okay. Maybe a complementary question in terms of your own impact on the market. Do you -- what proportion of the 35 were competitively tendered? Do you know?","John W. Lindsay","Brad, this is John. I don't think -- I would say very few. I mean, historically, at least in the U.S. land space, we're not doing a lot of major bids, particularly when you're looking at our long-term customer base, they recognize the value. They like the consistency of the offering, and they have enough exposure to the market. They know what the market should bear and so most of the new rigs have been negotiated contracts.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understood. That's helpful. And maybe just to sort of related, and then I'll pass it on. But the 9 customers you referenced include some new ones, right? How many are new?","John W. Lindsay","There's a couple out of the 9. I believe that's right, a couple, that are new.","Hans Christian Helmerich","I think I'd add just one thought, which is this -- the size and scale of the new orders and it reflects a choice that customers are making, knowing the other race cars on the track. And they understand the offering that our peers are bringing to the table. I think it's a compliment to our guys that we're seeing the proportionality of new build contracts that we're seeing.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Juan Pablo, I appreciate the color during your prepared remarks regarding average day rates, and just wanted to get a sense for the commentary about improving spot market day rates. I mean, you're down to a handful of battle AC rigs. Could you give us a feel for the order of magnitude that you're starting to maybe see upward pricing momentum for your AC rigs working in the spot market?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, Byron. This is Juan Pablo. I have -- I think what we have seen so far and what we expect for the second fiscal quarter as we provide the outlook guidance operationally is a slight increase only. Let me make sure that I turn it to John and see if he might have additional comment. Going forward, of course, the market is going to determine what incremental pricing we can attain. We're optimistic in that regard, but I'll yield to John.","John W. Lindsay","Byron, one thing that we've experienced over the years, of course, and you've seen it in your career, rigs always drop a whole lot faster than they are -- then you're able to push pricing later. Fortunately for us, we didn't have a dramatic correction off of the current peak spot market pricing. So our correction delta isn't quite as much as what a lot of our peers. But we're continuing to see some strength. We're continuing to see rigs move out of gas basins and move into some oil basins, and moving rigs around. And we're still seeing some churn, even though our idle fleet -- AC fleet capacity is only 13, there's still some churn. We still have -- some of those 13 will go to work, and then some of those will get released. So that churn tends to have a little bit of a downward pressure. And I think the other thing is just competitor pricing. There's still, at least in some areas, what we would consider somewhat irrational type pricing behavior on SCR and even some AC rigs. And so I think that all has an influence on, yes, spot market pricing is improving. It's not improving dramatically, but it's improving.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then just a second question. I'm thinking about the cost side of the equation. On the far side of the seasonal impacts in the March quarter and thinking about the startup costs associated with the new build FlexRigs and maybe mobilizing some rigs between basins. My suspicion is that there is -- shouldn't expect any structural migration upward and that fleet averaged daily cost, I realize it's not easy to -- just maintaining it flat. But again, I wouldn't think that there would be any structural trend where those costs would necessarily fleet average costs would migrate higher over time.","Hans Christian Helmerich","That, I would agree with you, Byron. As you are moving rigs from basin to basin, you've got some personnel expenses associated that. When you have new rigs coming out, you've got personnel expenses associated with that. And so those are somewhat one-time. And so I would agree with you. It's not structural. And then, of course, just the second fiscal quarter volatility we've experienced. Again, I give our guys all the credit in the world, they've done an excellent job on that. And last year, the costs were much improved over the year before. So I just wanted to prepare everyone, make certain you realize that there's that possibility for at least in that next quarter to have some potential cost increase.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Hans, all the best to your retirement.","Hans Christian Helmerich","I appreciate it. Thanks, Byron.","Operator","We'll go now to Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Hans you had said couple of quarters ago that you got 57 customers who were just fine with the fact that your rigs skid instead of walk. And we continue to hear more and more about pad drilling in 40 wells off 1 pad, as an extreme and stuff. Are you studying or contemplating or doing some work on whether or not H&P needs to come up with a walking system?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, John and I'll both take a shot at that, Jim. I think -- and you've heard us and we've talked about it, where all of the rigs we built were sitting around with the best and brightest of the customer, and what they're wanting to accomplish, and there's no secret of what designs are available out there. And so what result you've seen with our skidding system is what the customers has asked for. Our capacity to put out a walking system is certainly within our reach. And again, it's going to be customer-driven and directed. I think that what may be missed sometimes in the conversation is the customers really looking at the overall performance and what the well cycles are and what the efficiency drivers are. And that's where we're focused as well. But sure, the skidding type and skidding system is important, and we'll be responsive to the customer on it. But I think you saw just with this last group of 35 that all of those will have our traditional skid rail system.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I was just looking at it for an update and if you've got 35 good customers and you've got the good customers. If they're okay with it, who are we to complain?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Yes, I think it's an element of a validation in that regard.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I would agree. In talking to some of the private rigs companies out there, the outlook is that for the top tier rigs, you could see a couple of thousand dollar day rate improvement through this year industry-wide. And it strikes me, Baker Hughes comes out and says the rig count's going to be flat. NOV's [ph] got their system that upgrades SCR rigs pretty well, and we're still adding top tier rigs. Do you guys subscribe to the view that the industry overall could see a couple of thousand dollar increase in day rates through '14?","Hans Christian Helmerich","I'm going to let John answer that. It's going to be great for the next 30 days. But it's going to be harder. I'll let John answer this going forward.","John W. Lindsay","Well, Jim -- thank you, Hans, I appreciate that. Jim, I think to forecast a $1,000 to $2,000 a day, I think, is a little premature at this stage of the game, and particularly when you say the guys predicting it are the smaller contractors that probably don't have the types of rigs that we're talking about that are really in demand. I don't know. It'd be hard to see that right now. But you how these markets work. You've been in this business a very long time and it can change -- the question earlier about natural gas. Do we see an improvement in natural gas drilling as a result of higher prices? That would be one of the things that could increase rig demand -- the worse thing, nice rig demand for FlexRigs. I think overall, we would expect to see some rig count increase at current oil prices. I think we'll continue to see the rig count trend up slightly. And again, it's very hard to predict. Is it 50 rigs or 100 rigs? It's difficult to predict.","Operator","We'll move now to Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All the smart questions have already been asked on the U.S. land side. And I'll again throw in a congratulation on the retirement for Hans. Well done, Hans.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thanks, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You\u2019re welcome. Let me ask on the international front. We talk about -- service companies talk about the potential for increased unconventional activities throughout the international marketplace. You guys indicated it in your conference call as well. Can we talk maybe timing and potential magnitude of that increase in activity? Is that a 2014 event or a '15 event or is it a 5-year event?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, we've handicapped it over the proceeding quarters. And I think, if you look back, we're really just at that inflection point now where the prospects for international drilling have significantly improved. If you go back over the recent years, it's been a tough slug out there. But Kurt, I'm inclined to think it could potentially be impactful even towards the end of this year, but I think it's just hard to imagine that there won't be traction. We just have a great customer roster that we know has keen interest in executing in a way that is similar to what they've accomplished with their supplier complement here in the U.S. So I think we're going to have an opportunity to participate there, and it could be sooner than you think. But certainly, it'll be in the timeframe that you outlined there.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My follow-up would be, and you talked about returning cash to shareholders through your prepared commentary and so on. Press release indicates an increase in CapEx related to the new build type of programs. You have one of the highest dividend yields, or highest dividend yield of a land driller and one of the highest and related to other larger cap diversified service companies. What's the thought process as you get through this year in terms of the dividend, more modest increases than we've seen in the past?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, I think, yes. We've hit some nice step change increases, and the last one being as recent as December, where we raised it to $2.50 per year. But I would say the modeling Juan Pablo does and what our projections are, are very much in line with what we're seeing now. And it kind of reflects this comment you've heard us make about an \"all of the above\" strategy, where we believe we've got the capability to grow the company, to add to the fleet, to look hard at international opportunities and then, at the same time, return meaningful cash to shareholders, and that will be through, I believe, additional opportunities to grow the dividend, and it could also come in an opportunistic way on share buybacks. And so we're in a great spot to be able to do a lot of these things. As you know, Kurt, our balance sheet would easily lend itself to some leverage with the right opportunity. So all of those things are in front of us, and it gives us a great position to look very hard at the opportunity set ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, very good. And I just want to make sure that I'm understanding some of the commentary that came out from John and Juan Pablo. So to be clear, you are the company starting to see price increases for the rigs that are rolling off contract, as well as when you bring the new rigs in, the price point on those new rigs are above the, say, the last, what 3-month, 6-month period? Is there a way that you could provide a little more color around that?","Juan Pablo Tardio","This is Juan Pablo. In looking at how our term contracts affect the average pricing or average rig revenue per day, we have these roll off during the next several quarters of what we, in general, see is rigs that were contracted in average in a better pricing environment. So it is not surprising to see in many cases where we have a term contract that rolls off and is contracted at a spot rate at a slightly lower day rate, reflecting the current spot market. In average, however, in addition to that, what we see, at the end of the day, as these rigs that are on term contract roll off, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we do see that the remainder of the term contracts, those that are already in place, yield an average that is slightly higher than what the current average is during the next couple of quarters. As we look at the spot market itself, as mentioned by John, we have seen rigs -- and the better example is, for a particular rig that is in the spot market, that is working under the same condition, same region, et cetera, we have seen a slight improvements in average. And so as we enter into new build contracts, we are taking advantage of that -- of those slight increases. Overall, it really doesn't impact the total average in general. As we mentioned, we expect quarter-to-quarter to have a flat transition in terms of average rig revenue per day.","Operator","We'll go now to John Daniel with Simmons & Company.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","John, real quick, can you review again the longer-term outlook in offshore? You made a comment on operating income, and I didn't catch it.","John W. Lindsay","John, we are -- we've had additional operating income as a result of our management contracts. We've taken over a management contract for one of our customers that will begin to deliver more operating income as the year transitions. And then we have an international platform rig that's also a management contract, we'll continue to see higher operating income there, again, as the year transitions. So that's the reason for the increases.","Juan Pablo, anything else to add?","Juan Pablo Tardio","[indiscernible]","John W. Lindsay","Does that help?","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes. I thought you said it was going down. I just want to make sure that was the case.","John W. Lindsay","Well, it's always possible. I didn't...","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","No, no. Okay. I was taking copious notes but not good enough. You mentioned that of the new builds, I think 70% will have the skidding system and 30% won't?","John W. Lindsay","Yes.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","We hear about...","John W. Lindsay","Go ahead.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I was just going to ask, why would someone not want that system and where would those type of rigs go?","John W. Lindsay","Well, it's a great question. It's really not basin-specific. It's more related to timing of development of the resource if you want to think about it that way. Effectively, what we had at the 23 Flex 3s, I believe 13 of those had skid systems and 10 didn't. And the 10 that didn't are drilling at least, at this phase, at this time, the customer is drilling typically well-to-well. They're drilling 1 well on a pad and moving. And so they're delineating, they're holding production, there's a lot of different reasons why. One of the real advantage of course of the Flex 3 is that, at a later time, when the customers says, \"You know what, we want to go into development mode. We want to drill 2 or 3 or 4 wells on a pad.\" Then they can add the skid system at a later date. So that's the reason for and of course the Flex 5s are purpose-built pad drilling applications.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. Alright. And then just one final one for me. Someone had asked earlier about your views on the idea of new builds continuing to displace legacy rigs, and I just want to follow-up on that being specific to H&P. If you look at the 35 rigs that you are building right now, or any of those replacing rigs that you currently have operating for the customers that have signed contracts for those 35 rigs?","John W. Lindsay","No. That would not have been the intent with 1 exception, and that would be if a customer would use a FlexRig as a bridge rig, as an example. They've got to start in -- they had to start in November, and we had an available Flex 3s, so the Flex 3 went in and drilled until the new build can be delivered. But it's not a replacement for technology reasons. It's a replacement in terms of convenience for the customer and having a rig sooner than what the new build could deliver.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Fair enough. And then the last one for me, just in terms of as we try to model trajectory here. Are you aware of any customers at this point that -- whether they'd be a new build or an existing rig, whatever, where they intend to drop a rig in the next 3, 6, 9 months? Or do you feel like all these rigs are ultimately incremental to your current working count?","John W. Lindsay","Well, here's to follow-up on the example I just gave you. The customer picks up a Flex 3 and then they have a new build that's going to replace it. A couple of things that can happen. One is they replace it and then that rig goes to work for someone else, that rig that had been working as a bridge rig. The other example is, a lot of times, the customer decides, \"You know what, I need to keep that rig.\" So they bring the new build in, and they keep the rig that was being used as a bridge rig. But we're going to continue, John, to see some churn where customers are making decisions, for whatever reason, which is why you're seeing some rigs move from one basin to the next. Obviously, our rig count in the Permian has grown dramatically. I think we're going to continue to see Permian -- the rig count for us grow in the Permian. So there's not any examples of those besides that.","Operator","Well go now to Tom Curran with FBR Capital Markets.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I've read that the U.S. companies who rely on family members for leadership succession, less than 30% remain viable by the third generation. Those that make it, though, then go on to perform well over time compared to their peers. So congratulations on beating the odds, and best of luck in this next chapter.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thanks for the comment, Tom.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","John, wanted to return to the 35 FlexRig new build awards since the end of the 2013 fiscal year. Sorry if you already touched on this, but could you tell us how they breakdown by model? And then the total number of customers you've won those 35 from?","John W. Lindsay","Yes Tom. 23 are Flex 3s; 11 Flex 5s; and 1 Flex 4. And those 35 have -- are contracted to 9 different customers.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Great. And I did hear correctly earlier that all 35, do have the skid rail system?","John W. Lindsay","No, 70%. So I believe 13 of the 23 Flex 3s were ordered with the skid system, there were 10 that didn't. And the Flex 4 does not have a skid system.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So the Flex 4 -- okay, great. And then when it comes to the indications you've gotten from customers about if and where they might look to first respond, activity wise to the continued uptrend in natural gas prices, where most likely would you expect to first deploy rigs as a result? And would you expect to have to upgrade any of the conventional idle FlexRig 3s to pursue these opportunities, or would you expect to be able to deploy them as is?","John W. Lindsay","The Flex 3s are all very suitable for drilling in any of the unconventional plays, whether they're natural gas or whether they're oil. So there wouldn't be any needed upgrade at all. I think the Haynesville would be a logical choice. The Eagle Ford, obviously, there's a lot of different reservoir in the Eagle Ford and some are higher in gas concentrate. And so you -- I think you could probably see that, that customers would potentially moves some rigs over into the Eagle Ford. It would be fairly easy to do that. But again, I don't have a sense. I haven't heard anything directly from customers at this stage saying, \"Hey, our natural gas is about $5, and we're going to ramp-up our drilling program.\" But most of what you we're hearing about is directed towards oil basins.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","But if we were to start to see that and they requested a skidding system on one of the idle FlexRig 3s, would you be able to upgrade it?","John W. Lindsay","Yes. Yes. We continue -- over the last 3 years, I don't have the numbers right here in front of me, but we've added significant number of Flex 3 skid systems to Flex 3s in the fleet, both that were idle and then putting to work, and then those that customers were using, and their program changed to the development mode, and they wanted to begin, like I said, drill 3 or 4, 5 wells on a pad.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me, John. When you look beyond the Big 4 land drillers, how many total Tier 1 rigs would you estimate are out there now and across how many different contractors? When I say Big 4, I mean, yourselves, Patterson, Nabors and Precision.","John W. Lindsay","Right. Well, I think, first of all, for us, at least from our perspective, Tier 1 is an AC drive rig. I just -- for me, definitionally, to put an SCR rig in the Tier 1 category, to me, it doesn't make sense from a technology perspective and down hole what we're able to deliver and the drilling advantages. We know there's approximately -- in the Tier 1 category, there's approximately 700 AC rigs that are active today and another 70 or so, so 10%, that are idle. And we think, maybe as many as half of those 70 aren't necessarily well-suited for the types of wells that are being drilled in unconventional plays. So outside of the Top 4, it looks like approximately 200 AC rigs are out there owned by smaller companies that are both public and private, best we can tell. So 200 out of the 700, we have 275 of those today.","Operator","We'll go now to Scott Gruber with Bernstein.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Hans, let me reiterate the congratulations and best of luck in retirement.","Hans Christian Helmerich","Thanks, Scott.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Juan Pablo, I think it was you who mentioned that average rate for rigs under term contract should continue to tic higher as contracts roll. Does that reflect the positive mix shift in terms of more rigs or skidding systems remaining under contract, and they generate higher rates?","Juan Pablo Tardio","That is one of the moving variables, Scott, yes. You know that you have a -- you have pricing considerations, you have a mix consideration in terms of the type of rigs that are out there, including whether or not they have skidding systems. You have different regions, that command different pricing levels because of their cost structures, et cetera. But yes, that is one of the reasons.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So overall, you could summarize it by saying positive mix shift on the remaining contracts for a variety of reasons?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then the early termination fees realized during the quarter, does that reflect contracts that were scrapped during the quarter?","John W. Lindsay","Well, it just -- what it reflected is some rigs that were that were in excess of what the customer's needs were going forward. And some of that's related to natural gas, moving rigs around. But the rigs, obviously, they still exist and we contract the rigs at a later date.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It's very customer-specific -- it was just an interesting phenomenon, given that the spot market is tightening up.","John W. Lindsay","Right. But we've seen this now, what, 3 quarters, 3 or 4 quarters in a row. We've seen customers that are either coming up on the end of their contract or, again, they've got more rigs in their fleet than what they need going forward. So they're really just balancing their portfolio.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from the Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Let me join everybody else in saying congratulations to Hans on your retirement, and thank you for your friendship and support all these last 10 years. And look forward again to maybe seeing you as you still make the rounds.","Hans Christian Helmerich","As is well. Thanks, Waqar. I've enjoyed it.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just following up on that. Ten years ago, you were originally -- you thought that the market needed a new type of rigs, and that vision is proven right, and has been instrumental in the shale revolution. Now as you look forward for the next several years, maybe next 5 years or so, do you see any other next step in this innovation? Do you see any other hardware that could be put on the rig that could make a difference, be that maybe integration of the road [ph] receivables, or is it even providing phasing [ph] services through a driller? Or what do you think the next steps could be in this innovation on the drilling rig?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Well, the better person to answer is John, of course. But I think, the way you posed it, Waqar, I'm not sure there's a hardware bolt-on, although we continue to look for ways to improve the FlexRig. And, as you know, today's Flex 3, which still represents the largest share of our new order book, has improved and incrementally been made better over time. So that can continue to happen, and we'll be anxious to try to find ways to do that. I think on the software kind of knowledge capture part of the equation is where a lot of opportunity still lies ahead, and to drive a consistency across the performance range is still something the customer's very interested in. So if you look at a typical field, we have the uniformity of our offering, and you have the opportunity to put the right people in place. But even so, you have this scattergram of results and how do you tighten that up? How do you reduce the delta of why one rig is still performing better than its twin rig? And that's just done through better performance and knowledge capture. It's working with the customer in collaborating on where are we introducing human judgment where we can really fine tune that. And it sounds maybe simpler than it is, and you've seen our setup and followed us closely and know what our capabilities are, and I think we're in the best position to deliver those incremental improvements and efficiency. And I think that's being reflected even today in our new build awards.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Thank you. But just the last question on the gas markets. What is the lead time from [indiscernible] wants to pick up rig and when they call you to inquire about a drilling rig for gas drilling? Meaning that if they want to pick up in the third quarter of this year, fourth quarter or first quarter next year, when would they give you a call to say, \"Hey, we'll be needing a rig\"?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Yes, that's a good question. We have lots of just overall inquiries along that line now. They don't necessarily say we're sitting on the fence waiting to drill a gas-directed target, but they are asking about when is our next available slot open. They know that we have fewer and fewer available AC rigs on the sidelines. So we're getting those calls now. But your question's a great one in terms of what's the tipping point psychologically when the industry begins to say, \"Hey, these gas prices provide us an opportunity to go back in the field and drill gas wells.\" And that, of course, makes a large impact on the prospects of our business.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So in terms of the volume of incoming calls on for gas-directed drilling, has that picked up in the last month or so, or no, not yet?","Hans Christian Helmerich","Not yet. And they're not saying to us, \"We have this group of gas wells.\" Having said that, we've got a big customer that has 8,000 known locations that when gas prices improve, they're going to go execute on drilling those. So it's out there, the potential and opportunity set is out there. And you probably understand the dynamics better than I do about what are the pricing dynamics that really trigger that renewed effort.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you very much, Priscilla. And thank you, everyone for joining us.

The speakers today will be John Lindsay, President and CEO; and me, Juan Pablo Tardio.

You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call this morning. Last week, a former oilman and well-known investor dubbed the American oil industry as dead in the water after multiple quarters of capital starvation and deteriorating rig counts. While we don't agree with the characterization of the industry being dead, that shoe may fit non-Tier 1 legacy, SCR and mechanical rigs in the U.S.","We have long believed Tier 1 AC drive rigs, which constitute nearly 100% of H&P's fleet and 64% of the working industry fleet today, are the relevant rig assets for drilling horizontal wells in the U.S. land segment. After hearing many of the comments from this earnings season about the importance of Tier 1 rigs for drilling the most efficient horizontal wells, this appears to be the consensus view today.","Since 2002, our strategy has been designing, building and operating Tier 1 rigs. Over the past five years, the industry has gone through an energy renaissance, and well complexity has dramatically increased right along with efficiency. H&P has led the way with innovative solutions that have set H&P apart from its peers, particularly in how we have leveraged AC drive technology. First, by taking ownership by internalizing expertise in the areas of equipment performance, capital repairs and where practical, vertical integration. Second, providing support services. Our electrical and mechanical staff enable us to leverage knowledge and life cycle learnings of equipment, and our performance groups are proactively engaged in helping our customers to lower total well cost.","Finally, we are committed to a process I will call continuous evolution where in-house technical resources collaborate with their operational counterparts to enhance existing technology by adding new capability and functionality, as well as leveraging data more effectively to the benefit of both our customer and the company.","As in the past, we will continue to invest through the cycles. We have had great success in partnering with customers and moving ideas quickly into operational deployment. We are developing solutions that will add incremental capacity and\/or capability to address market requirements, and we can do this in a scalable and cost effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs to provide value for customers.","We've also taken leadership positions in other areas. Our many firsts include integrated casing running services, scripting of wells for enhanced reliability and efficiency, enhanced software control capability, integrated stick-slip mitigation, and many other technology solutions that today are standard offerings. The industry has also formed a consensus view that 1,500 horse power AC drive Tier 1 rigs provide the best drilling performance for drilling the most challenging horizontal wells. H&P's fleet has over 30% of the estimated 700 rigs in the U.S. market today that fit that description. We believe H&P's rigs are strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly.","Let me use the Permian Basin as the example of strategically placed and ready to mobilize quickly. The Permian, by all accounts, is the premier basin in the U.S., and some would argue in the top three of oil basins in the world. No drilling contractor has a stronger Tier 1 footprint there than H&P. Today, we have a total of 39 FlexRigs on contract in the Permian, more than our top three peers combined. Additionally, we have over 60 idle FlexRigs available with 1,500 horsepower AC drive capability that are ready to work.","Let me also make the point for ready to mobilize quickly. We've made prudent investments and taken great care to idle and maintain the FlexRigs properly. Field-tested processes are used to clean and preserve the equipment. In addition, the rigs have been assembled and maintained as needed so we are ready for the most efficient and cost-effective deployment when the market improves. For good or bad, H&P's Permian facility has become one of the photographic symbols of this downturn. And as many can see, our FlexRigs are standing tall and ready to go to work.","We often get questions regarding how quickly we can respond to demand with our idle fleet of FlexRigs. We feel very confident we are positioned better to respond than others as a result of the investments made in the fleet as described. Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe we can grow our market share in an improving market as a result of the mentioned characteristics, strategic placement and the ready state of our rig fleet.","In addition to rigs being ready, an obvious need and a key advantage in ramping up activity is the availability of quality people. We have done everything in our power to keep our best people. Clearly in a downturn of this magnitude, it is impossible to keep everyone. Like all companies in the energy sector, we've had to make significant cuts in spending and personnel. It has been very difficult to say good-bye to so many, but we are thankful for having such great people today and look forward to the opportunity of bringing back to work many of those former employees once the cycle turns.","Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, I want to recognize that in the face of adversity, I've been very pleased with our folks' response in dealing with the downturn. Our focus has remained on doing the right things and retaining the right people to enhance our competitive advantages going forward.","Juan Pablo?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, John. The company reported $21 million in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compensation from customers corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts, once again allowed us to report quarterly profit. Nevertheless, market conditions continued to deteriorate and drilling activity for the company continued to decline.","Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $63 million in segment operating income during the second fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 20% as compared to the prior quarter, resulting in an average of close to 106 rigs generating revenue days during the second fiscal quarter.","On average, approximately 84 of these rigs were under term contracts, and approximately 22 rigs worked in the spot market. In addition to rigs that are no longer contracted and became idle during the quarter, several more rigs became idle that remain under long-term contracts and that are generating revenue days at standby-type day rates, protecting the expected daily cash margin during the term duration of the contracts. This increasing number of rigs with standby-type day rates represented approximately 17% of the rigs that were generating revenue days in the segment at the end of the second fiscal quarter.","Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 1% to $25,931 in the second fiscal quarter, and the average rig expense per day increased by approximately 10% to $14,139, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $11,792 in the second fiscal quarter.","The increase in the average rig expense per day was primarily attributable to the large number of rigs that became idle during the quarter, generating expenses related to personnel management and rig stacking, which were then allocated across a smaller number of revenue days for the quarter.","It was not a surprise to see our quarter-to-quarter daily expenses increase as we had guided toward $13,600 per day for the quarter. But the increase was higher than expected as we experienced some unfavorable volatility during the quarter related to different type of expenses that we expect will return to more normal levels during the following quarter.","The segment generated approximately $80 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the second fiscal quarter. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate over $80 million during the third fiscal quarter, about $20 million during the fourth fiscal quarter, and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues.","Nevertheless, about 60% of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the second fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that, as of March 31, had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liability section of our March 31, 2016 balance sheet as deferred revenue. We cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options to take that rig back to work at full day rates have expired.","Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 87 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up 10 rigs since our last conference call in late January. Total early termination revenues related to these 87 contracts are now estimated at approximately $460 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $183 million during fiscal 2016 and $189 million after that.","As of today, our 347 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 84 rigs generating revenue and 263 idle rigs. Included in the 84 rigs generating revenue are 77 rigs under term contracts, 72 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, seven rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 79 rigs generating revenue days in the segment.","Nevertheless, approximately 18% of these 79 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates, protecting daily cash margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the five rigs generating revenue and not generating revenue days include newbuild rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers.","Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect a decline in the range of 25% to 28% in the number of total revenue days quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $25,000, partly as a result of the relatively high proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,800. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which is partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs.","Our third fiscal quarter average rig expense per day estimate also includes the impact of a relatively high level of expenses related to a significant ongoing reduction of field personnel positions and employee early retirements. Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs for which we have received early termination notifications, the segment currently has term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 71 rigs during the third fiscal quarter, 69 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 63 rigs during fiscal 2017, and 33 rigs during fiscal 2018.","The average daily margins for these rigs that are currently under long-term contract is expected to remain strong during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed. The average pricing today for the seven rigs in the spot market remains over 30% lower as compared to spot pricing at the peak in late 2014.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income declined to approximately $3 million from $8 million during the prior quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 6%, and the average rig margin per day declined by about 7% to $7,436 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the second fiscal quarter were rigs that remained idle on customer-owned platforms and are generating standby-type day rates.","As we look at the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to decline by approximately 8% as seven of our nine offshore platform rigs generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to increase to approximately $8,000 during the third fiscal quarter. The expected decline in activity is attributable to a rig that was demobilized and stacked onshore during the second fiscal quarter.","Management contracts on platform rigs continued to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the second fiscal quarter was approximately $2 million. Management contracts are expected to generate approximately $3 million during each of the remaining two quarters of fiscal 2016.","Moving on to our international land operations. The segment reported operating losses of approximately $2 million during the second fiscal quarter. The average rig margin per day decreased sequentially from $11,811 to $10,487 per day during the second fiscal quarter. Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 7% to 1,307 days during the same quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days, including 10 in Argentina, two in the UAE, one in Colombia, and one in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under long-term contracts. The 24 remaining rigs are idle. We expect international land quarterly revenue days to be slightly down by approximately 3% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, and the average rig margin per day to slightly increase to approximately $11,000 per day.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. Our strong balance sheet and high-liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contracts and reduced CapEx requirements should continue to allow us to return cash to shareholders by sustaining the level of our regular dividend payments as previously discussed.","Excluding rigs with long-term contracts that have already been early-terminated and combining all three of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 99 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2016, 78 in fiscal 2017, and 47 in fiscal 2018. Our backlog level as of March 31, 2016 was at approximately $2.3 billion. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are now expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, as compared to our prior guidance of $300 million to $400 million.","As mentioned in the past, we expect our total annual depreciation expense for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $580 million, and our general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135 million. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 32.6%, and we expect the effective tax rate for each of the remaining two quarters of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 33% to 36%.","With that, let me turn the call back to John.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Juan Pablo. I wanted to mention a couple of comments before we open it up to Q&A. As you know, the U.S. land rig count today is comparable to the all-time record low that's reached in 1999, and some are comparing the cycle to the 1980s. Even with the recent oil price rebound of $45 a barrel, sharp reductions in personnel expenses and investments are continuing worldwide.","With the market intelligence we have today, we expect to see further deterioration in terms of drilling activity during the third fiscal quarter. That said, we are seeing more indications that the bottom of the cycle is nearing. The question remains how quickly E&P companies gain enough confidence in the market to begin investing back into the business and putting idle FlexRigs back to work.","And now, Tanisha will open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hello. Thanks, guys. You mentioned the advantages of your rigs and the technology that they have. You also have a number of competitors that are coming out with sort of the latest and greatest rig designs. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on are you looking to come out with a new rig design? And at what point do you think you'll start increasing investments to prepare yourself for the next cycle?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Dan. This is John. Well, I think if you look at the investments that are being made, first of all, all of those rigs are AC drive technology and so that's kind of the basis for the design. And a lot of the design criteria on a lot of the rigs are really in an effort to match a lot of the rigs that we have out in the field today. So as far as just pure rig designs \u2013 and I'm speaking primarily to the drilling contractors, I'm not addressing some of the other rig designs out there described as futuristic-type designs. I'm speaking more to the contractors today. We continue to add technology, and we have over the past 10-plus years. We've continued to have innovations that improve our systems, and we're continually upgrading and high-grading.","So I sure wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that we're not looking at other designs and other opportunities. The fact of the matter is I think the industry has all of the Tier 1-type rig assets that are needed, the question is which of those assets are going to work. Obviously, we feel very confident that our rigs are the ones that are going to be most sought after. So we are continuing to invest, but I don't see any real \u2013 based on what I've seen, I don't see any real breakthroughs in terms of technologies that are being talked about out there.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the last point you made about being able to put rigs back to work. There's a lot of moving parts in your daily operating cost. But if you were to add an incremental rig or 10 incremental rigs, what do you think the daily operating cost would be for those specific rigs?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think putting out the next 10 rigs, 20 rigs, 30 rigs would be a very low cost for us. The good news for us, obviously, as you would increase your revenue days so your denominator would increase, I mean that's, part of what's driving our costs up. Costs, in general, and rigs that are actually working are very reasonable, it's the other costs that we have associated. So I think the more rigs we could put back to work, the better off we're going to be in terms of our total cost per day.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right, thanks.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hey, Angie.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","So John, if you think about \u2013 and we've talked about this a little bit before, but maybe you can elaborate the potential day rate outlook in a U.S. recovery and how you think it could play out. Some drillers are saying that push for day rate on the initial rig is activated, but I think you said in the past that you thought maybe the first 100 rigs could be up flat, day rates to maybe bend under pressure, some fight for share, and the second 100 of rigs where you could start to see rates play out. So can you give us your thought?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Angie. I think that what you described, I think, has some merit. I mean, obviously, ultimately if you have folks that are pricing in such a fashion that is outside of the norm \u2013 but I think, in general, what you described makes sense. I mean, early on, I think you're going to see some real pressure on spot market pricing. I mean, as you know, there's not much of a spot market to speak of out there right now. There's not a lot of pressure, there's not a lot of bidding going on.","But I think the other thing to keep in mind is, in contrast to previous cycles where really every rig out there was out there fighting for that type of work for the more difficult, unconventional horizontal wells, that's a fairly small subset, as you know, of the total rig fleet if you were look back to the peak activity in October of 2014. So I think it's \u2013 we've described it as around 700 rigs or so that are 1,500 horsepower. And, of course, you're going to have a subset of those rigs that are going to be the top performers that are going to have the best equipment. And those are the rigs that are going to be those most sought after.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, in conjunction with that is if you think you play through that recovery and you know that a number of rigs are in this ready-state status, and if you think back how quickly you could start to add rigs, is people going to be a bottleneck and have you had any conversations with your E&Ps on what oil price they would need to come back to the market?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we have on the price, and as you know that price is different for different customers. I think in our last call, we described it as a $45 to $55 range. There's been a few E&Ps, I think, recently that have talked about $50. Obviously, there's a lot of confidence that has to be made up between now and then, really beginning to put rigs back to work. But I think that's probably the range that we would need to see in order to see rigs going back to work.","As far as our fleet and related to people, we've had great success in past cycles in attracting people back to H&P. We obviously have a lot of experience on the rigs today, so we have all the drillers and all the skill positions. We would need to be hiring back more jobs related to floorhand-type work. And again, our belief is that once the industry is on a clear path to recovery, I think you have people that would come back to the industry. But again, only time will tell on that.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And one more if I could slip it in, that's really helpful. Can you remind us of your FlexRigs? And you mentioned 700 of the rigs are 1,500 horsepower. How many of your FlexRigs is at1,500 horsepower?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's over 300 \u2013 yeah, 323.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Okay.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","That would be in the U.S.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct. Yeah, that's just in the...","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Wonderful. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Angie, I might also mention when you look at where the rigs are positioned, and I talked about the Permian, if you look at our available fleet, the rigs that are idle, we have a little over 30% in the Permian, a little over 30% in the Eagle Ford. And so those are, from my perspective, two of the lower cost basins that you would expect to see rigs going back to work. So we're positioned really well from that.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then for \u2013 you guys are the leading market share in both those basins, correct?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, got it. Thanks.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Marietta with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matt Marietta - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Marietta - Stephens, Inc.","I wanted to see if I can get a little bit more color on the CapEx reduction. Are you guys seeing greater efficiencies on the maintenance CapEx side? Are you seeing deflation in supplies or labor? Is this more of a function of the overall outlook in the active rig count in the fleet? Maybe help us understand all the different ins and outs there as it is about $50 million or so in savings from the prior guide.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure, Matt. This is Juan Pablo. As we had described in the past, a lot of the $300 million to $400 million that we've previously estimated were related to market conditions. And obviously, market conditions have been soft, even softer than expected and they're expected to remain relatively soft. And so that is driving down some of the maintenance CapEx, and also some of the special projects that would be in response to a potentially improving market. So it's mostly based on market conditions.","Matt Marietta - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you. So I guess there hasn't been a major structural change in kind of a run rate maintenance CapEx as we think about a per-rig basis. We shouldn't think of there being a permanent change there, right?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Not really. It's not a perfect process, of course. Maintenance CapEx depends on a lot of considerations. One important one is what rigs do you have working. If you have mostly newbuild rigs working or rigs that have been built in recent years, then your maintenance CapEx will probably be lower, and that's part of what we're seeing out there. The other consideration relates to a lot of components being available in the existing fleet that we're trying to be as efficient as we can in using that, of course, (33:37) before seeing any deterioration in the field for the lack of use.","Matt Marietta - Stephens, Inc.","I appreciate the color. And then my next question here, really switching to the international fleet, can you maybe help us see the long-term goal internationally? Can you continue to use South America, for example, as kind of a relief valve as it relates to what's clearly an oversaturated U.S. land complex? And maybe talk about the appetite for Tier 1 rigs internationally. Do you see that changing and evolving? I recall you were able to send, I think it was 10, 12 rigs down to South America recently or over the last couple of years. But what other opportunities do you see? Can you maybe expand more in the Eastern Hemisphere? As you look at the international rig fleet, a lot of is in South America. How can we view kind of that international business for H&P in the longer term do you think?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Matt. This is John. And we've talked about this for years and you're right, we did have \u2013 we did send 10 existing FlexRig3s to Argentina a few years ago now. And we have Flex3s in Colombia, and as well as Flex4s both in Colombia and in Argentina. And we have Flex3s and Flex4s in the Middle East. So we've thought for a long time that we could have some significant growth internationally.","As you know, the international markets are struggling right now as well, but we do see the current fleet that we have in the U.S. being able to expand internationally when those opportunities arise. We keep thinking that it will be growth in the international area in terms of unconventional resource plays, and really that's what the 10 rigs \u2013 the growth in Argentina for the Flex3, that's what that was all about.","And so hopefully, we'll see that happen. I think there's nobody better positioned than H&P to take advantage of that. As you know, we've been working internationally for over 50 years, so we have a lot of experience and capability. So we're just waiting for those opportunities.","Matt Marietta - Stephens, Inc.","I appreciate that. And do you think that as you look in the Middle East as maybe an area where you could deploy more assets, is there a hunger for more rig contractors to enter into the market? Or can you maybe help us understand the competitive landscape, how difficult it is to break into certain territories, I guess, in a greater scale if you're already there? That's kind of my last question here, and I'll hop back in the queue.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Well, I don't think there's any doubt that having a footprint there is advantageous. We've got a couple of Flex3s in UAE and we have some Flex4s in Bahrain. So we have some opportunity to expand. Again, we're looking forward to that. We just don't have anything, really, in our sights right now in terms of opportunities. But we believe that there will be opportunities in the future.","Matt Marietta - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Just looking at the guidance here for the upcoming quarter. It seems like the proportion of rigs on long-term contract is going to be pretty high as a proportion of the total rigs working. And then looking at the margin guidance, you have margins going down. I would've thought that margins would move higher if you have a larger proportion being a long-term contract. Can you speak to that, please?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure, Marc. This is Juan Pablo. There are at least a couple of things that are contributing to an unfavorable move. And the first one has to do with the growing proportion of idle rigs and expenses associated with those idle rigs. Some of those expenses are fixed. Some relate to the process that we are going through, the transition. As rigs become idle, as you know, there are stacking expenses. There are personnel expenses that we incur, and so that impacts the average unfavorably.","We also have a couple of other things going on. One is related to a higher-than-normal number of personnel positions in the field and early retirements related to employees. So that's what is impacting the average rig margin, the $13,800 that we've guided toward, in a way that is unfavorable. Hopefully, as John mentioned, as we see more stability and hopefully see rigs going back to the field, we hope to have a favorable movement in the average rig expense per day.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is there anything that's \u2013 you mentioned the personnel cost there that may be perhaps one-time? Is there any piece of this that we can think of as one-time in your fiscal third that won't be in the fourth?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Well, it all depends on what levels of transition we see in the fourth fiscal quarter. Obviously, when we have transitions like these, all of those expenses, we believe, are specific to the quarter and hopefully are non-recurring. But unfortunately, we've been going through this quarter after quarter. During the third fiscal quarter, we expect a very significant decline, as mentioned, of 25% to 28%. And when that happens, those expenses that pertain to the quarter and all the moving variables that are not normal and that are ongoing, that's really what's going on.","Going forward, we \u2013 hold on just a second, please. Yeah. One clarification. I may have related it to a margin guidance of $13,800. I was referring to the average rig expense being $13,800, of course, as we spoke earlier about. But let me stop there. Does that answer your question, Marc?","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. That's helpful, Juan Pablo. I guess, maybe related is \u2013 has there been any adjustment in any of the contracted rates that you have?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Not significant. As we mentioned, some of these rigs are becoming idle, and we are charging day rates that protect us in terms of the expected margin for those rigs. But nothing significant is going on in terms of what we expect to attain from our long-term contracts.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay...","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Marc. This is John. I wanted to also clarify and make certain that the guys in the field have really done an excellent job, we talked about it on the last call, related to expenses and really managing that in a really strong way. So this cost increase really has nothing to do with the rig itself as I had mentioned before.","The leadership team was in Permian Basin a couple of weeks ago, and it was really impressive to see how hard they're working and the attitude that they have in this market. But when you consider all the things that Juan Pablo addressed, that's really what's driving the cost. It's not the actual expenses at the rig side.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks, John. If I could just one more for Juan Pablo, I guess. On the depreciation, been running a little bit lower than the guidance that you provided for the year. Is there any reason to think that on a quarterly basis it's going to tick up here in the back half?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","It may. There are some variables that impact that. Hopefully, we'll see a number for the year that is lower than the $580 million. But we don't have enough information and certainty at this point to provide that guidance. We may update the guidance, of course, during our next conference call.","Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. I'll turn it back.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Marc.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Daniel, John with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Hey, guys. A couple of things for you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hi, John.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International","How are you?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","I'm doing all right. Thanks.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Okay. First question, just based on inbound inquiries from clients, do you believe that revenue days will increase in the fourth fiscal quarter over the current quarter?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, there's not a lot of \u2013 unfortunately, there's not a lot of inbound calls. And I think if we were to make an answer based on a hunch \u2013 if oil prices would remain $45-plus, and I think you could see some confidence in the market, I think you could begin to potentially see some rigs go back to work. But as you know, as we all suffer through \u2013 witness last summer when oil prices were in the $55 to $60 range and then pull back, and so I think it's going to have to maintain a level of consistency for some period of time before you see rigs going back to work. But I mean, I wouldn't be surprised to see rigs going back in the fourth quarter. But at this stage of the game, we're sure not receiving a lot of calls.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Fair enough. Because you did mention that, I think, the fiscal Q3 cost per day guidance does include some rightsizing costs. That would seem to me that you're not expecting a sharp recovery at this point or a quick recovery.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Based on what we see right now for the third quarter, we don't see any recovery. Obviously, it could happen...","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Right.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...it could be ongoing right now, and it would begin by \u2013 one way to think about it is rigs that have been given notification of release. Those notifications get rescinded and rigs don't actually get released. And rigs that are on standby would go back to work, and then ultimately you'd begin to see some rigs being picked up in the spot market. So that could happen. We just haven't' seen it begin at this stage.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International","Fair enough. Just one final one for me, then I'll it over. But I'm trying to just better understand the whole impact of drilling efficiencies and how that'll impact the recovery in the rig count. So just on that point, when you visit with customers and they share with you their rig count needs going forward, let's assume on a higher commodity price deck, do they provide any color to you about what their peak potential rig count may be? And if so, how does that compare with what may have been their most recent peak rig count?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, I think there's a...","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International","I know it's a hard one.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it is a hard one. And I think one of the reasons why it's so hard is because \u2013 I mean, there is that \u2013 really, probably one of the last things anybody is really thinking about right now because they've been cutting their rig counts and trying to figure out how to rightsize their organization. I don't think anybody is really thinking about those types of comparisons. I think, longer term, I personally don't think it's as dramatic as a lot of people believe. But again, only time is going to tell. I sure don't expect to see 1,800 rigs working anytime soon. But yeah, we just haven't heard anything from customers on that point.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International","All right. Thanks, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","May be I can start with just sort of the inverse of Angie's question, which is how much of the fleet today is 1,000 horsepower?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll take a look at it.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And with all the emphasis on the 1,500s, what is the outlook for the 1,000s?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we have around 22 rigs that are 1,000 horse. Those rigs are typically designed for more vertical, shallower type work. We actually have that particular model of Flex4 working in Colombia, in Argentina and in the Middle East. Actually, I'm not certain the ones in Argentina are working right now. But, in any event, we have those rigs. So those rigs are candidates to work internationally. They're obviously candidates to go back to work in the Permian Basin because that's where most, if not all, of those rigs are located.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Vertical is?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","For vertical-type work now, not for horizontal work.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah, okay. So there's no real risk of impairment to those at this point?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I sure don't think so. Again, those rigs have worked recently, and I think that that vertical \u2013 that 8,000- to 12,000-foot vertical-type work in some of the basins in the U.S., and as well as internationally are going to be in existence.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. On reactivations, what do I have to see in terms of term? I mean, sure you're going to have to go out in hard cruise and spend some money to gear up. I imagine you're not going to do that for a well-to-well-type of work.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Michael, I think for anybody to expect that you're going to get term contract work coming off the bottom in this environment, I think that would be a surprise. Again, in order for us to activate a rig and get it out working is going to be very, very low cost for us. We're well prepared, acquiring the personnel. That's not a high cost, so I don't see that as being a stretch. And we won't be going in. And more than likely, you're not going to just drill one well unless the commodity environment were to begin to pull back again. You're going to drill multiple wells. So I'd be surprised to see many of these rigs going back to work with term contract commitments.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. So the decision to reactivate really is a function of nothing else immediately available and you don't want to say no to a client?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's in our best interest to get rigs back working for a lot of reasons related to people and revenue days. And as Juan Pablo described, I mean, that's a part of the challenge that we have related to expenses, is a larger numerator and a smaller denominator. So if we can put rigs back to work, then that's beneficial for us and beneficial for customers, beneficial for our employees.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, for sure. I understand that, I just mean the decision to activate, whether it's really customer driven or you anticipating customer activity.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, yeah. I mean, we have, as you know, really long-term relationships with some really strong customers that would probably be some of those that would respond more quickly than others. So yes, we're going to be there for them and be ready to respond.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Good morning. Wanted to \u2013 most of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to ask you about the status of the facility that you have in Houston, where you assemble and refurbish rigs. And just from the way it looks, I think you had a little bit of a backlog of maybe three or four rigs yet to be built that you've deferred. But what role might that play going forward? It seems like it would be a long time before you would actually build another rig or even refurbish, since you've got some very new rigs, right, ready to go.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Robin, this is John. The facility \u2013 you're right. Don't expect to be building any new rigs anytime soon. We have utilized that facility. You touched on refurbishing. We have utilized that facility to refurbish rigs, getting them ready for international work. We've also used that facility for certain upgrades that we've done to our rig fleet.","And so that's part of the way that, up to this point, in addition to finishing out those newbuilds that we've been able to keep some folks employed. But obviously, it's not going to be turning out the amount of material that it did before, but we'll continue to keep an eye on that. But that's how we would utilize that facility and other facilities is to upgrade and high-grade the fleet.","Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And with the remaining kind of backlog of newbuilds that you had, has that been switched to, like, existing rigs that are available or...","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Robin, this is Juan Pablo. We have a couple or three rigs that are pending delivery. So those are \u2013 the construction for those is ongoing and we expect that to be completed this year. But as John said, other than that, meaning other than the rigs that already have long-term contracts associated with them, there are no plans for other newbuilds at this time.","Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. Okay. All right. Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","All right, Robin. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Close with Oppenheimer + Close. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Mark H. Close - Oppenheimer + Close LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. Just to clarify on the CapEx, the delayed newbuilds, how much of that is included \u2013 I mean, we're looking at, I guess, CapEx for the year ahead of \u2013 I mean, for the back half of the year of $120 million to $170 million. How much, if any, of that includes those delayed newbuilds and how much of that \u2013 how would these delayed deliveries affect your depreciation estimates?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Mark. This is Juan Pablo. Unfortunately, I don't have a specific answer for you. I believe that most of the expenses related to the new builds have already been absorbed during the first two quarters. I'd have to double check on that. And remind me the second part of your question, Mark.","Mark H. Close - Oppenheimer + Close LLC","So if you've got new builds that have been completed but have not been delayed \u2013 I mean, not been delivered and are going to be delayed for whatever period of time, are those depreciating? And...","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you. Yes. We typically depreciate our rigs once they spud operations. And so the delayed rigs have not yet began depreciation from a financial perspective.","Mark H. Close - Oppenheimer + Close LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And so obviously, that's impacting the depreciation number in a slightly favorable way, making it slightly lower than expected. But the impact is not very significant, given the scale of our total depreciation.","Mark H. Close - Oppenheimer + Close LLC","Right. Right. Okay, thanks.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Tom Curran with FBR Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Good morning, guys.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hi, Tom.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll try to be quick. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a few fleet specs ones. John, could you tell us, of your 1,500 horsepower FlexRig segment, what percentage of those have three mud pumps and 7,500 psi capability?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tom, we haven't published that. I know the number continues to grow. We haven't published that up to this point. So it's probably \u2013 hold on, just a sec . Yeah, Tom, we don't have it sorted quite like that. Again, it's probably 30% to 40% of our fleet. But not all rigs that have 7,500 also have a third mud pump. So there's some mix associated with that. Same way with four engines, there's different criteria that customers have had, so it's not as easy to slice and dice.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Understood, John. But that 30% to 40% rough estimate, would that apply to the 1,500-horsepower FlexRigs or your total U.S. land fleet?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I believe the 1,500-horsepower, yes.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And then one more on this line of questioning. Are you continuing to upgrade your idle rigs? And if so, what all are you including in those upgrades? To the extent you're doing it, is it still just adding skidding systems to FlexRig3s that don't have them, or have you now also started to add third mud pumps, and where possible, upgrade the PSI capability?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Tom, we've continued to upgrade the fleet to 7,500 on those that have 5,000, where the customer needs it. We've added third mud pumps. We've added fourth engines. We've increased setback capacity on the rigs in order to handle \u2013 a lot of the rigs already have the capacity for 25,000-foot a setback, but not all of them do and so we're upgrading that. There's just \u2013 there's various \u2013 I kind of addressed a little bit of that in my prepared remarks, that we've continued to do that over time, and we're doing that in this cycle as well.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And I know you spoke to CapEx in the beginning, so I'm sorry if I didn't catch all of this, but could you give us an idea of how much of the CapEx budget is being allocated to such upgrades?","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think we've narrowed it down to that, Tom. I mean, it's not a huge percentage. I don't know that we've updated...","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. We don't have a number for you, Tom, unfortunately.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. All right. I appreciate the additional answers and staying on a bit later. Thanks, guys.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Tom. Thanks.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you. And Tanisha, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Okay, perfect. We'll go ahead and take our last question from Darren Gacicia. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","Hey. Thank you very much for adding me on at the end.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you.","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","My question is around rig margins and the progression they may take in the recovery. I think you said that spot day rates from the peak are down around 30%. I think you said over the course of the call that most of the rigs, if they go to work, at least in the front end of a recovery, will come from spot. So when I think about that, that seems to tell me that even as you recover, your day rates can continue \u2013 your average margin can come down. I guess the question really lies in terms of, A, calibrating that, but, B, thinking about what the absorption offset is from a fixed cost perspective, and just how to calibrate that. I realize you guys have taken a fairly conservative tack on the call, but I'm just trying to get a sensitivity thought process on how to think about that in my model.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yes, Darren. This is Juan Pablo. There are so many moving pieces there that I would hesitate to even start outlining those because \u2013 there's not just one or two that I could mention that would bring clarity to that. I think your overall assumption is true. Obviously, if we enter a recovery and we put rigs back to work, those rigs will probably go back to work at day rates and margins that relate closely to where we are in the spot market today. And as that happens, the impact of that will be probably negative on the margin as we have a high proportion of rigs in the spot market going forward, assuming, of course, that there is that recovery.","The only other factor that I'll mention is what John already mentioned, and that is that as we put rigs back to work and the total number of idle rigs begins to decline, that in general will have a favorable impact on margins as some of those fixed costs related to the idle fleet will start to be reabsorbed. But I'm sorry not to be able to provide more clarity, but hopefully that helps.","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","Well, maybe asked a slightly different way, in terms of the margin degradation we've seen so far, is there any way to kind of get a sense of that? What part of it's been absorption and what part of that is pricing?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Darren, I'm not sure that I understand your question. Could you rephrase it, please?","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","Well, put it this way, pricing declines may roll through and that should impact the margin line directly. Then there's kind of an absorption part of it. So is there a way to think about things on pricing versus absorption in terms of what we've already seen?","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Not a simple, straightforward way, Darren. I think pricing will depend \u2013 the average rig revenue per day will be impacted by the proportion of rigs that are on standby and that have significantly lower day rates as we don't have the rigs working and what proportion that makes up in terms of the total. But that's just one more moving piece as we go forward.","I think what may be an important part of the question is related to the rigs that we already have under term contracts and what those margins might be. And the answer to that is that the margins to the rigs that are under term contracts that are currently operating or that are on standby-type day rates, those are as strong as we expected. We have not seen any deterioration there as expected. Obviously, we've benefited from early terminations in a very significant way.","And so our backlog is a very important piece of the equation for us, and it has been strong and we expect for that to continue to be strong. But other expenses related to transitionary expenses, related to all of the aspects that we've already mentioned are also an important part of the equation.","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Juan Pablo Tardio - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you, Darren. And now, we'll turn it back to John Lindsay for some closing remarks.","John W. Lindsay - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So thank you again for listening this morning. I'm going to close by leaving you with the following thoughts in that our long-term contracts have allowed the company to remain profitable and to protect FlexRig investments. The company's efforts in energy are focused on adding value to our customers and becoming even more efficient and effective as an organization. Whether we see more declines in activity or significant improvement in demand, H&P is well positioned to respond.","As we have described in the past, our strong and liquid balance sheet, robust backlog, and lower spending requirement should allow us to continue to return cash to shareholders. Our strength is driven by our people, and we appreciate their attitude in the face of this adversity and their dedication to the company through these difficult times.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.","And it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Juan Pablo Tardio. Please go ahead, sir.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, and welcome everyone to Helmerich & Payne's Conference Call and Webcast corresponding to the First Quarter of Fiscal 2015. The speakers today will be John Lindsay, President and CEO; and me, Juan Pablo Tardio, Vice President and CFO.","As usual, and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.","We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. We achieved record levels of revenue and operating income during 4 consecutive years as well as record revenue and operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2015.","However, the strong quarter is overshadowed by a rapidly deteriorating energy market. When the oil markets -- with oil markets oversupplied, sluggish demand forecasts, prices at 6-year lows and without confidence that we've reached a pricing floor, great uncertainty exists for our customers. If triple-digit oil prices were unsustainably high, what isn't clear is how far the pendulum may now be swinging to price oil at unsustainable levels on the low side.","As a result, drilling activity and spot pricing has significantly declined in the U.S. Many industry analysts have predicted a 500- to 900-rig count reduction in U.S. land. And since the peak of activity at the end of October 2014, recent rig counts already appear to be down by 300 to 500 rigs. This wide range depends on the rig count source and how inclusive it is of smaller rigs.","So far, however, the burden of the rig count reductions appear to have been shouldered by our competitors' legacy rig fleet. By using third-party rig counts, we estimate that approximately 58% of the sideline rigs are mechanical rigs and that approximately 27% are SCR rigs, while AC drive rigs make up approximately 15%.","We expect the downturn may also reduce the number of planned new builds for 2015. The industry will most likely deliver 100 to 120 new AC drive rigs throughout the year with an expectation that all of these rigs would be sponsored with term contracts. This total would be a much lower number and cadence than originally estimated in 2014.","Looking at past downcycles, the rig replacement cycle usually accelerates. This can be seen most recently during the peak and troughs since 2008 and 2009 in the U.S. land market. The legacy rig fleet, made up of mechanical and SCR rigs, reached a lower-peak rig count in each successive cycle. As an example, using third-party data, we estimate that the peak count for mechanical rigs was approximately 1,000 rigs in 2008, approximately 800 rigs in 2012 and approximately 600 rigs in 2014. Today, we estimate that the mechanical rig count is below 400 rigs, actually lower than the SCR rig count for the first time.","Historically, rig count reductions at this stage of the cycle tend to be indiscriminate. And this downturn is no different. Spot market rigs are the first to go, and even top-performing AC drive rigs have been released. However, once the trough rig count is reached, rig quality, safety and performance are all evaluated to make decisions when putting rigs back to work. Customers have a choice. And H&P is focused on strong field performance, where our people are determined to win the confidence of the customer every day, and that provides us an important advantage.","The rig count reduction thus far has been more swift than many expected. We reported earlier this month that the number of idle FlexRigs was increasing and spot market pricing was down approximately 10%, and we expected additional softness in the market going forward. The outlook for pricing and activity continue to be lower, and we don't see the outlook improving during fiscal 2015.","I heard someone say recently, \"The job of correcting markets when they're oversupplied is to find a price that destroys the oversupply.\" And in this case, the process that is required to destroy the oversupply is for E&P companies including our customers, to side light -- sideline hundreds of drilling rigs in the U.S. including H&P rigs.","Our field employee count is directly proportional to our rig count. Unfortunately, that means we have begun the process of making significant reductions to our workforce as we idle many of our rigs. Based on what we know today, it is possible that we will have approximately 2,000 or more field positions eliminated by the foreseeable rig reductions. This is, without question, the worst part of the downturn.","Nevertheless, we still believe H&P is the best-positioned drilling contractor. Fortunately, we still have 31 new builds to deliver, all sponsored with 3-year term contracts, a backlog of $4.6 billion to start the calendar year and term contract coverage of an average of approximately 160 rigs for the remainder of fiscal 2015.","Before I turn the call back to Juan Pablo, as I think about the outlook, our experience has taught us that in the face of a very negative market like we see today and a growing perception and panic of weaker-forever prices, the market does work, and eventually, all fundamentals improve.","Now Juan Pablo will give you more details on the first fiscal quarter and our outlook for the next quarter.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. The company reported a quarterly record level of $332 million in operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also reported record revenue levels of well over $1 billion for the quarter. Although we are now expecting drilling activity to significantly decline, the number of revenue days during the first fiscal quarter also represented a record level.","Following are some comments on each of our drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations delivered approximately $295 million in segment operating income during the first fiscal quarter, excluding the impact of early termination of long-term contracts. The number of revenue days increased by 2% from the prior quarter, resulting in an average of over 297 active rigs during the first fiscal quarter. Approximately 179 of these rigs were active under term contracts, and approximately 118 rigs were active in the spot market. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day increased by 1.6% to $28,603. And the average rig expense per day decreased by less than 1% to $13,046, resulting in an average rig margin per day of $15,557.","During the quarter, we generated approximately $23 million in revenues corresponding to long-term contract early terminations. Given existing notifications, we may generate over $60 million during the second fiscal quarter from additional early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts.","Since our last conference call in November, we have received termination notices for a total of approximately 22 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, 7 of which were estimated to have under 90 days of remaining contract duration and 7 of which have contract durations that extend beyond September 30, 2015, which is the end of our fiscal year.","As of today, the 340 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include 243 active rigs and 97 idle rigs. All except 1 of our active rigs are AC drive FlexRigs. Of the 97 idle rigs, 73 are AC drive FlexRigs, and the remaining 24 idle rigs are SCR rigs. Included in the 243 rigs that are active today are 162 rigs under term contracts and 81 rigs in the spot market.","Looking ahead at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to decrease by roughly 25% quarter-to-quarter. And given the current trend, we could have less than 200 rigs active by the end of the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early-terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue to decline to levels between $27,000 and $27,500 per day. The average rig expense per day level is expected to increase to roughly $13,350 as we deal with some volatilities and significant changes in activity levels.","Subject to additional early terminations, and excluding rigs that we have received early termination notifications for, we have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 160 rigs during the second quarter and an average of about 137 rigs during the second half of fiscal 2015. The average quarterly pricing level for these rigs that are already under term contracts is expected to remain roughly flat during the first -- excuse me, during the fiscal year as some rigs roll off and new builds are deployed.","The quarterly average pricing for rigs in the spot market slightly increased from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 but is expected to significantly decline during the second fiscal quarter. Spot pricing today is over 10% lower as compared to pricing for rigs now working under term contracts, whic of course, were negotiated over the last few years.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $21 million from $15 million during the prior quarter. Total quarterly days increased by about 10%, and the average rig margin per day declined to $20,732. All 9 of the company's platform rigs were active by the end of the first quarter.","As we look at the second quarter of 2015 -- of fiscal 2015, we expect revenue days to remain relatively flat, along with a decline in the average rig margin per day to approximately $19,500. Given current market conditions and some expected platform-to-platform rig mobilizations, we would not be surprised to see activity levels and average daily margins decline during the rest of the fiscal year.","Management contracts on platform rigs continue to favorably contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Their contribution during the first fiscal quarter including some favorable retroactive pricing adjustments was approximately $8 million. But this is expected to decline to approximately $6 million during the second fiscal quarter.","Moving on to our international land operations. Segment operating income increased to approximately $12 million during the quarter. The average rig margin per day increased to $10,770. And quarterly revenue days remained flat at an equivalent of about 23 active rigs.","As of today, our international land segment has 20 active rigs including 9 in Argentina, 5 in Colombia, 2 in Bahrain, 2 in the UAE and 1 each in Ecuador and Mozambique. 14 rigs are idle including 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in Tonisia -- Tunisia, pardon me, and 1 in Bahrain. An additional 6 rigs already assigned to this segment are in various stages of transition from the U.S. to Argentina.","For the second fiscal quarter, we expect international land quarterly revenue days to decline by about 10% to 15%. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decline by about 25% to 30% as compared to the first fiscal quarter, excluding any impact from early contract terminations.","We received early termination notification for a rig with a long-term contract that is now idle and expect approximately $8 million in early termination revenues from that contract. We also have ongoing discussions with a customer regarding the possibility of an additional rig contract early termination.","The daily margin weakness in this segment is primarily due to several rigs in transition and others becoming idle. The first 4 rigs related to our 10-rig YPF project have commenced operations in Argentina. We now expect to see roughly 700 revenue days from this project during the third fiscal quarter and to hopefully be at full activity during the fourth fiscal quarter. The project's daily margins, that is the project's daily rig margins and contribution to the bottom line, are also expected to improve as this long-term project is fully deployed during the fiscal year and transitional expenses are behind us.","Let me now comment on corporate-level details. Given lower levels of expected activity during fiscal 2015 and a partial deferral of new FlexRig construction spending to fiscal 2016, we now estimate capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion during fiscal 2015. We are reducing the construction cadence to 2 FlexRigs per month beginning in June through the end of the calendar year, allowing us to have new build continuity as we go through this downturn while, at the same time, not impacting the corresponding value of our backlog.","Roughly 70% of the CapEx estimate for fiscal 2015 corresponds to our new build program, less than 20% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to other projects. The portion corresponding to our 2015 new build program also includes most of the major components in dollar value required for the 6 FlexRigs under term contracts that are now scheduled to be completed during early fiscal 2016.","Although we still expect to generate cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015 in excess of the $1.1 billion generated during fiscal 2014, we may need to externally fund a portion of our capital expenditures during the fiscal year.","With a debt-to-cap ratio today of approximately 2%, our balance sheet is in great shape to enable the funding of our continued organic growth under the sponsorship of attractive long-term contracts with customers. Including the long-term contracts for the 40 new FlexRigs scheduled to be delivered during fiscal 2015 and the 6 additional ones now scheduled for fiscal 2016, we already have secured term contracts for an average of approximately 160 rigs across our drilling segment during the last 3 quarters of fiscal 2015, an average of almost 130 rigs during fiscal 2016 and an average of approximately 100 rigs during fiscal 2017.","About 90% of those rigs correspond to our U.S. land segment and provide the company with the benefit of an average pricing level that is expected to generate great margin per day averages that are higher than the $15,557 per day average corresponding to our most recent quarter. The term contract coverage just mentioned excludes long-term contracts for which we have received early contract termination notifications. Given that these early terminations allow us to remain whole in terms of our expected cash flow from the corresponding operations, their impact on both our earnings and liquidity should be favorable, as this accelerates the expected payback on our investments.","Given changes in market conditions, our backlog decreased from approximately $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2014, to approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2014. The value of our backlog is expected to continue to decline during the second fiscal quarter, as we earned a corresponding income during the quarter through operations or through early contract terminations.","We still expect our total annual depreciation expense to be slightly over $600 million during fiscal 2015 and our general and administrative expenses to be slightly over $140 million.","The recent tax law change in bonus depreciation allowances resulted in a first fiscal quarter 2015 adjustment given a reduction of our 2014 cash taxes. This also increased our deferred taxes by approximately $100 million. This accelerated depreciation of property and equipment for cash tax purposes will favorably impact the company's liquidity during this fiscal year.","We expect the effective rate for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2015 to be between 35% and 36%. We repurchased approximately 810,000 shares during late November and early December of 2014 at slightly under $60 million. We did not repurchase additional shares after that time frame given the significant change in market conditions.","We have a 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2017. We're currently using -- pardon me, we are currently only using it for letters of credit and have over $250 million available to borrow under that facility.","As it relates to our investment portfolio, the holdings remain unchanged as compared to the prior quarter. These holdings were recently valued at close to $150 million with an after-tax value of over $90 million.","With that, let me turn the call back to John.","John W. Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo. And I'll close with a few comments regarding H&P's advantages and our outlook going forward before opening the call to questions.","H&P has an experienced management team and seasoned field operations personnel that know how to manage through a downturn. The experience gained in the company's 95 years will continue to serve us well.","And speaking of long-term service, I would like to acknowledge Steve Mackey on this call and his nearly 30 years with the company. Steve is retiring soon from his role as EVP, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer at the company. Steve worked closely with Hans for over 25 years, and I've been fortunate to work with Steve since 2006. He has contributed in many ways to the success of H&P. Steve, thank you for your many years of service, for your contributions, for your leadership, and every one at the company wishes you the best.","In addition to great people, we have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and access to capital. We have a large term contract backlog supported by a very strong customer base. Finally, we have the largest and most modern fleet of AC drive rigs in the industry. We believe our strategy has positioned the company to be competitive through the cycles. Whether we are faced with a downturn, like we are today, or in an improving market environment, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities ahead.","And now we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to the side of Jeff Spittel with Clarkston Capital.","Jeffrey Spittel - Clarkson Capital Markets, Research Division","Maybe if we could start off with a little bit of perspective on what's going on in the different basins, and if you could add a little bit of incremental color about where things have gotten the ugliest so far and maybe where things are holding up a little bit better.","John W. Lindsay","Jeff, this is John. I'll give a little bit of an overview. It's similar to what we talked about earlier this month. I would say the areas that we've seen most of the weakness, if you think about it in terms -- not necessarily of just raw rig releases, but if you think about it in terms of percentage of rigs released in the basin that we're working in, we've -- the rigs, we have a small footprint, 11 or 12 rigs, out in California. That's been hit pretty hard, where about 80% of the fleet has been released there. The Niobrara has had over 50%; Marcellus is around 50%; Woodbine, 60%; Bakken is 40% -- a little over 40%. So the -- for us, I think, a positive is our distribution of rigs in basins like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Both of those basins are our largest. Now we obviously have had several rigs released in each of those basins. But to give perspective, the Eagle Ford is down 25%, 28%, something like that; and the Permian is over 30%. So while we have had rigs released in those basins, it seems like those tend to be a little stronger in terms of the economics going forward.","Jeffrey Spittel - Clarkson Capital Markets, Research Division","I appreciate that. And you referenced -- eventually, this is going to create a market share opportunity. And it sounds like, obviously, with those sorts of numbers, people are letting rigs go, as you mentioned, indiscriminately at this point. From a timing standpoint, do you think that opportunity to capture market share comes to fruition a little bit more in fiscal '16 given that we're probably still relatively early innings in the rig count decline?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think just by the nature of our contract coverage and the quality of our fleet, even though the releases are indiscriminate, as I said in my comments, what we've seen thus far, if we're looking at the data correctly, is in the 300 to 500 rigs that I mentioned. Again, it's a pretty wide range. But that's what the third-party rig services -- or rig count services, best we can glean out of that. You still have a large percentage of that, 57%, 58%, are mechanical, and 27% are SCR. So yes, we are impacted. I think -- and again, it's not anything you're in a position to brag about at all. But I mean, we're still in a situation where I think we're picking up a little incremental market share as the -- as this falling-knife situation is going on. So I do think, to answer your question, I have no idea what the outlook is in terms of when we reach bottom. Are oil prices -- have we reached that level now? I don't think there's a great certainty in the market that we've gotten there. But if we are, that -- our experience is, is that when you get to that point where customers can put together budgets that they can count on and they can get a rig count forecast going forward, then I think that's when we have an opportunity as customers begin to high grade their fleet. I think that would be the opportunity that we would then be able to take advantage of.","Operator","And we'll go next to the side of Jim Wicklund with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Look, 15,000-plus daily margin. We're hearing from all the service companies that they're being asked to cut prices by anywhere from 15% to 25%. And then everybody is pushing down the supply chain as much as they can. I guess my first question is, how much on a spot leading edge rate is that 15,000 at risk? Will companies come and say, \"We'll let you have a $2,000 a day margin,\" or they will cut you by percentages? Or how does the mechanics actually work of you trying to stay working and them trying to get the price down?","John W. Lindsay","Well Jim, again, as usual, that's a great question. And we are -- again, our experience at this stage, in most cases, rigs that are in the spot market, what we've seen up to this point is a reduction a little over 10%. We have used the '09 downturn as a benchmark because it's really the closest in terms of this dramatic reduction in rig count. It's the most recent example that we have to draw upon. And what we saw then, Jim, was around a 30% reduction on FlexRigs. And so we went from similar pricing levels, $27,000 a day, $27,000, $28,000 to high teens. And we're not there today. I was going to say we're in the low 20s, but obviously, the longer this goes on, that has the potential to see that in the spot market.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Guys, I'm looking at your expenses. How much can you push down on your supply chain? You mentioned that your $13,500 (sic) [ $13,350 ] average daily cost is going to go up a little bit. Is there any potential with the operator paying for fuel? And the way things are structured, is there any potential for you guys to push down on your supply chain in any meaningful way?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think in any case where -- if the downturn is long enough, then you begin to get some response back through the supply chain. Our expenses were actually lower in the first quarter than what we had originally estimated. As you probably saw, we're guiding towards higher expenses now as a result of the transition that we're seeing with rigs going to the sideline. That's a...","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's hard to stay ahead of it. I know.","John W. Lindsay","It's hard to stay ahead of it. But I think, over time, there's the potential to see that. But again, the other thing to think about on our cost structure is 2\/3 of our expenses are labor costs. And so you have a -- somewhat of a small percentage of your total cost that is variable that you can work on. And again, I think we're better positioned as a company today as far as a lot of the processes, and you've probably heard us talk about some of the things that we've been successful in doing with our supply chain. So I think we're better positioned from that perspective. But to answer your question, I think, over time, we'll be able to get some improvement in our cost. But for right now, it's hard to see much past the next quarter.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Guys, last one if I could. You mentioned that your debt-to-cap is only 2%, but you're probably going to access the Capital Markets to give you a little bit of cushion. And I guess you guys had tried kind of a soft raise of $1 billion. Do you have an idea of how much you'd like to have or need coming into this downturn?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Jim, I didn't realize we were out looking for $1 billion.","James Knowlton Wicklund - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's funny how rumors get first started in the downturns, isn't it?","John W. Lindsay","Yes. Yes, it is. Well, let's set the record straight. We're not out looking for $1 billion. Yes, I'm going to turn the response over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you, John. We don't have a number to share with you now. But as John just mentioned, we would expect our debt-to-cap ratio to remain very low, perhaps between 2% and 10%, but nothing as you've described.","Operator","And we'll go next to the side of Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Juan Pablo, I appreciate all the color on the fleet and how to think about revenue per day. I think I heard at some point -- there were a lot of numbers. I think I heard at some point you say spot pricing today is roughly 10% lower than your term-contracted rigs. And I'm just curious as to -- if you could give the order of magnitude of what it was in the recently completed December quarter as a frame of reference.","Juan Pablo Tardio","It was very close. So spot and term were very close, maybe 1 or 2 percentage point differences, so we've seen a 10% drop in spot. As John mentioned, that market, the spot market, appears to be softening as we speak. And we'll have to see how far that goes.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then with regard to the 31 new builds still in the queue, I would guess that the lines here of those are still skewed toward the Permian. But I was wondering if you could provide a little color on the regional disposition of those. And to the extent that you have your customers want to push out those deliveries further out on the horizon, I'm assuming you'll get some sort of daily compensation for those delays. Is that fair?","John W. Lindsay","Juan Pablo's looking at the distribution on the new build. Byron, this is John. I'll touch on the -- yes, typically, Byron, when we are pushing the contracts out, it's a win-win situation for us and the customer. And of course, we're H&P shareholders, and we're trying to do things that are cash flow neutral. And again, I think, from our perspective, I feel like what we've been able to do thus far in working with our customers has made a lot of sense.","Juan Pablo Tardio","To your comment, if I may add to that, about 15 of the 31 are expected to go to the Permian; I think another 10 to the Woodford; and then other places like the Eagle Ford and the Woodbine.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So John, you took some time there to walk through the dynamics on how, each cycle through, we've seen fewer and fewer mechanical rigs operating and now that you have, I guess, more AC rigs than mechanical rigs. I know we're still in the very early stages of trying to manage through this downturn. But when we come out the other side, what risk or opportunity do you see with your current rig fleet? And some of your FlexRigs will be pushing on 10-plus years old. So what kind of risk is there for some of your idle rigs, potentially, in this next cycle run to have a little bit more challenge going back to work?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Kurt, I think you've probably heard us talk before that while the first FlexRig3s that we've built in 2002 to 2004, those rigs, we've continually high graded and upgraded with the latest and the greatest, whatever that may be. And if you compare the rig -- those particular rigs and the day rates that they were able to command through the cycles and most recently in the most recent peak, the spot market pricing that those rigs achieved, it was very similar if not the same as what we had on rigs that, in the spot market, that had rolled off of their term contract that may have only been 3 or 5 years old. So while I -- again, it's a good question. I think, as I look at us and our overall fleet profile, one of the big advantages we have is this fleet continuity and uniformity and the size of the fleet and our ability to utilize standard processes for driving better drilling performance, rig move performance, safety performance. And I think all of those are advantages that will serve us well as we -- in the future as we come out of this downturn and customers begin to look at expanding their fleets and high grading their rig fleets. It's hard to say what the legacy rig count will do over the next 3 to 6 months, but what we can see is a pretty clear trend as we go through these cycles.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","John, then maybe as a follow-up, you guys indicated 160 rigs on term contract for this upcoming quarter and then 130, I think, on average for the remainder of your fiscal year. Again, just trying to think the process through. Given what's going on with spot rates and, obviously, lack of demand for putting rigs to work, what kind of percentage of -- what kind of appetite would there be for the E&P companies necessarily to feel like they have to put your rigs that are going to roll off back on term when there's so much availability in the marketplace?","John W. Lindsay","Well, rigs that are rolling off of term contract, as we've seen in the past, some of those rigs continue to work in a spot-market environment. We're going to be competitive in the spot market. Obviously, our value proposition is valuable through the cycles, and so we're going to be competitive. And there'll be some hand-to-hand warfare in the trenches, I'm sure. But I think we're well positioned to get in there and battle it out and keep rigs working in the spot market. Again, at this stage of the market, it's hard to determine what level of rig activity we're ultimately going to go to. Like I said, we're in this 300 to 500 range now, and many expect it to be closer to 900. So with that in mind, I would say we're going to continue to see rigs in the spot market released. And potentially, again, depending on the rig and it working for a particular customer, in some cases, rigs will roll off of term, and then they'll roll into the spot market and they'll continue to work. The question is what's the rate in the spot market.","Juan Pablo Tardio","And if I may add a little bit more granularity to the numbers, I think we said about 137 in the U.S. land segment working the second half of the fiscal year. On the third quarter, the average would be closer to 145. On the fourth quarter, it'd be closer to 130.","Operator","And we'll go next to the side of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.","Scott Gruber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Juan Pablo, can you help us think about how the deferred tax liability comes due as the new build program winds down?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Well, I'll give it a shot, Scott. It depends on many moving variables. But certainly, the retroactive application of the allowance for 2014 is very helpful for fiscal 2015 liquidity. As I mentioned, we expect an additional $100 million coming in from that source during the fiscal year. As we go into 2016, 2017, it all depends on what happens to CapEx spending during those years. I think what your question might imply, which is, I think, fair, is let's assume that in 2016, CapEx levels are much lower, perhaps closer to maintenance CapEx as compared to fiscal 2015. If that were to happen, then yes, we would see a reversal. But the reversal would be very slight. I -- we have a $1.3 billion liability related to deferred income taxes. That would probably come down by maybe between $10 million and $30 million during 2016. And then in 2017, it might be another amount that might be a little larger than that if CapEx continues to be very low. But if CapEx increases at some point, then we would once again probably start to defer additional income taxes. Did I address your question, Scott?","Scott Gruber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, you did, and you answered my follow-up even before I could ask it, so you're definitely thinking ahead. And so maybe if we can switch gears then. I was a bit surprised with the guidance on the international front just in terms of activity in 1Q. Can you talk about -- 1Q calendar. Can you talk about the outlook for the rest of the year on international side of the business?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Sure. We've had a few rigs become idle, some of those in Ecuador, Bahrain. We've seen Argentina also decline in terms of activity. The bright light, of course, is related to the YPF project, where we have 10 FlexRigs under 5-year contracts each that are in the process of being deployed. And so that will improve activity levels or at least, hopefully, more than offset any other declines that are market-driven from other countries and even from Argentina rigs that may become idle given market conditions. But -- so it's going to be a balancing act. We're pleased with the level of margins that we expect from our contracted rigs including those in Argentina. We have other contracts in other countries. It really is a combination of several things. But it's tough to see activity start to decline in general and also margins become softer. As I mentioned, what we do expect after the transition that we see that is ongoing, that is rigs becoming idle, rigs moving to Argentina, country to country, et cetera, we hope to see some improvement in daily margins by the end of the year. But again, it'll depend on market conditions in a significant way.","Scott Gruber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But do you think it's reasonable to assume that you still have some active rig count growth over the course of the year with growth in Argentina more than offsetting potential declines elsewhere? Or is it more reasonable to assume a flattish environment from here?","John W. Lindsay","I'd hate to speculate on that, Scott. I think it's reasonable to assume the flat to up. But it -- again, it'll depend on market conditions.","Operator","And we'll go next to the side of Brad Handler with Jefferies.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a couple clarification questions because I'm not quite sure. I think, John, you were helpful in giving us percentage declines in basins in an earlier question. Those are for the industry, right?","John W. Lindsay","No. Those are our experience up to this point.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Your experience, okay. So for example, the Marcellus, your experience was down 50%.","John W. Lindsay","Yes. And then again -- and so using that, Marcellus is a -- for H&P is a very small basin. That's the reason why I summarized it in -- on percentages, but I also said, well, really, our big exposure, the big basins with Eagle Ford and Permian and Bakken. We're really strong in the Eagle Ford and in the Permian.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understand. Okay. And then maybe another way to ask Scott -- or I get it, Scott's issue, and it wasn't quite as clear for me as I want it to be. You -- Juan Pablo, you gave us the contracts for average '15, '16, '17. Can you just give us U.S. lower 48 contracted values for those years, please?","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes. Let me start with -- let me come back to fiscal '15. But on fiscal '16, I have 100 -- approximately 115 rigs; and approximately -- excuse me, 85 rigs for fiscal '17. Going back to fiscal '15, let me give you quarterly numbers for the remaining 3 quarters. For the second fiscal quarter, it would be approximately 161 rigs. For the third fiscal quarter, it would be 145. And for the fourth fiscal quarter, it would be approximately 130.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. All right. I really appreciate that clarity too. If I could squeeze in one more, please, a question about the early terminations. I guess maybe it's a little bit of a looser question. But in some of the prior downturns, have you experienced as much early terminations as you -- on some sort of relative basis as you are experiencing thus far this -- in the last 2 or 3 months?","John W. Lindsay","Yes, Brad, we -- in 2009 and 2010, we -- I believe it was over 35.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Yes, between 35 and 40 early terminations in fiscal 2009, I believe.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So if I rough [ph] the math now, it looks like you're already there. Given the $60 million in early termination in 2Q, I'm sure it'll push you over the 40 number. And of course, you're on a -- that's on a [indiscernible] and a ledger count.","John W. Lindsay","I'm sorry. No, Brad. We were around the low 20s in total.","Juan Pablo Tardio","So I think you were hearing us talk about dollars, perhaps, when we were talking about total rigs early terminated. So let me go ahead and try to clarify that, if I may. For what we've seen so far since our last conference call, since the steep downturn here, we've seen a total of 22 early terminations in the U.S. And we've already reported for the first fiscal quarter that we have approximately $23 million in revenues corresponding to that. In the second fiscal quarter, of course, we'll have to determine, but we estimate that the early termination revenues would be over $60 million. So the $23 million plus the $60-plus million corresponding to those 22 early terminations. Now let me go back to 2008, 2009. In 2009, I believe that we had between 35 and 40 rigs early terminated in the U.S. during that entire year. And the corresponding revenue from that -- and the number that I'll give you, it does include fiscal 2010, I believe, but it was over $200 million. I think it was close to $210 million.","Brad Handler - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. Yes, you're right. I had -- I heard the 22. I thought it didn't cover the second quarter terminations. I didn't realize that, that was encompassing all the rigs, so I got it, so great.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But John, if I could follow up on just the headcount reduction. In particular, I know that you all have always had a very robust human resources program. Can you talk about what this means from a recruiting standpoint and what you're doing on the front end? And also, how do you protect the loss of intellectual capital with these reductions?","John W. Lindsay","Well, Michael, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on the process and what we do. What I can say is we've been successful through the cycles in maintaining our skilled personnel, our most experienced people. Again, like my comments said, you've got positions that get eliminated as these rigs get -- go idle. But we do -- we have a very good HR effort. We have very good people and good systems that enable us to hang on to our best people. And that's ultimately what our goal will be going through this downturn, is hanging on to our best folks.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And coming out of the downturn, as you start to put rigs back to work and go to hiring again, generally, what's been your experience, say, coming out of the trough of '09 in terms of the productivity hit associated with having to train people as you're bringing them on and adding rigs? And what's that -- I can see what it's done to your cash cost, but is that something that we should be mindful of as well?","John W. Lindsay","Well, I think our experience would be, coming out of the downturn, the productivity is very, very good. It's very strong. And as you can imagine, at peak rig counts, when the industry is scrambling and trying to attract as many people into the industry as possible, that a lot of times that has some negative impact on performance. But our -- I think our track record has been really good because of the -- our ability to work more rigs through the cycles. I think it's been communicated pretty strongly through the field operation. And as we begin to put rigs back to work, we generally have a lot of folks that are interested in going to work for H&P. So that's been our experience. I can't say it's what that will be in the future, but it sure feels that way. Again, I think we've got a lot of things on our side here, obviously, the rigs, the uniformity, the fleet. The safety record that we have overall as a company, I think, over time, has been very good.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Daniel with Simmons & Company.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","John, have you guys allowed any of your customers at this point to sublease rigs?","John W. Lindsay","John, that is something that, through various parts of the cycles, we've -- there is a provision in the contract that customers are able to do that, and they have some -- have had some assignments. There may be a couple that are ongoing right now. I think, at this stage of the market, there's not -- as you can imagine, there's not a lot of people looking for rigs. But there are a few examples of that. And like I said, through the cycles, we'll see our customers do that.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. I'm just trying to understand the -- if possible, what the delta would be in terms of what they're willing to sublease from a rate versus maybe perhaps your spot rate, if there's much delta between the 2. Do you have any color on that?","John W. Lindsay","I really don't, John. I mean, that's really -- you probably need to ask the -- the operators need to ask our customers that because I really don't have a feel for that.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then like some of the others on the call, I missed some of the commentary from the prepared remarks. But Juan Pablo, did you comment on or quantify the average cash margin attendant to those contracted rigs in fiscal '16? I thought I heard you say something in a $16,000, but I was writing feverishly and I didn't...","Juan Pablo Tardio","I did. I did mention that on -- the U.S. land rigs that are under term contracts, not only for fiscal '16 but all of them through the next -- including fiscal '15 and then through the next several years, we mentioned that the average expected margin per rig per day would be over the average that we saw for the first fiscal quarter in terms of total cash margins for the quarter. And that was a reference of $15,557, which corresponds to the first fiscal quarter. And so a short way to put that is that we expect even better margins for -- from all of our term contracts going forward.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And I presume there's no willingness on your part to adjust or amend those term contracts for customers?","John W. Lindsay","Well, John, again, we've done our best. This isn't the first one of these cycles we've gone through. We've done our best to create win-win situations. We do our best to stay whole on that. I think it's interesting because when you think about our customers and operators in general, when they release rigs and their rig lines become idle, then they're reducing their future outflows of CapEx. I mean, that's an obvious statement. But you contrast that with us, and when we ink a new contract, when we have a term contract with a customer, that's when our CapEx -- the majority of our CapEx is then. So we've made a commitment. We've made a commitment to our supply chain and to our suppliers. And so again, a lot of our costs are already sunk. And of course, our goal is to get it paid back and get a rate of return on that investment that we've already made.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Just a couple of quick ones for me here. Are any customers at this point having payment issues yet? And does the G&A guidance incorporate any growth from that expense?","John W. Lindsay","Not at this point, John.","John M. Daniel - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then the last one for me. As the rig count goes lower, do we see cash costs per day go higher as you spread those costs over the lower rig count?","John W. Lindsay","Well, we've seen in past cycles that our expenses went up, but primarily, that was associated with transitional rigs becoming idle and costs associated with idling those rigs and preserving the rigs properly and taxes and things like that. I'm not aware of any additional costs that we've seen as it relates to that. I mean, we're going to -- we'll manage through that, again, depending on how many rigs ultimately become idle.","Juan Pablo Tardio","And John, let me further clarify. What we're referring to potentially going up slightly is the average rig expense per day. If we're -- if we would be referring to the total operating costs, those costs would be coming down significantly in proportion to the decline in activity, of course.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Thomas Curran with FBR Capital Markets.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I'll just limit this to one question and can tackle the rest with you next week. Returning to international, Juan Pablo, in your flat to slightly up outlook, could you address 2 topics? The first would be term indications, if any, from YPF of an interest in potentially increasing your working rig count for them beyond just these initial 10 and any interest you'd have in doing that. And then the second would be there are some seemingly resilient bright spots out there onshore internationally. Yes, I guess the most obvious would be Saudi Aramco, the UAE. Are you exploring, at all, moves into those or any other markets that look as if they might be more resilient?","John W. Lindsay","Tom, this is John. As far as Argentina YPF at this stage, we've talked previously about additional rigs. I'm not aware of any ongoing or recent conversations about additional rigs. And as far as just overall international, at least my sense is, right now, I think everybody is sitting back and waiting and watching to see where pricing, where oil pricing is going to go. I don't know of -- and again, we've talked to our marketing folks, business development and operations folks, and there's really not any -- what I would consider any real bright spots on the horizon that I can think of right now. Juan Pablo, is there any areas that you can think of?","Juan Pablo Tardio","No, John.","Thomas Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","John, just a quick follow-up there. If they were to emerge, though, would you be open in considering other markets in the Middle East or anywhere else?","John W. Lindsay","Sure. Sure. We have -- we continue to look and look for opportunities to grow the business. And again, it obviously is a great opportunity. That was why we were able to take advantage in Argentina, is at the time when we first entered into those contracts, we had 15 rigs available or so in the market. And we were able to take advantage of that. So obviously, we're in a situation where we're looking to -- for opportunities and looking to expand.","Juan Pablo Tardio","Thank you very much, everybody, and have a good day.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you for joining us on the call. Even though oil prices have pulled back over the past several weeks, it is still encouraging to see signs of optimism in the market. In May, the Baker Hughes U.S. land rig count hit a low of 380 rigs and has since increased from what everyone hopes was the absolute bottom of this market cycle.","Recently, some E&P companies have announced budget increases and rig count additions. It is a positive sign, although many still remain on the sidelines. This has been an extraordinary downturn, over 1,400 rigs have been idled in the U.S. and tens of thousands of industry participants have been laid off. The impact has been pervasive and has affected every enterprise within the industry.","H&P remains very strong and has been proactive and effective in adjusting to this new environment, but the declines in activity and spot pricing have significantly impacted our bottom line and the size of our organization.

Shale customers have high expectations, and concurrently, well complexity is increasing as a result of extended laterals.","From a rig requirement perspective, extended laterals require more hydraulic horsepower and greater capability, which is why 1,500 horsepower AC rigs are the rig of choice. H&P has close to 50% of the available 1,500 horsepower AC rigs in U.S. land, so we're positioned very well in the market. We currently have 90, 1,500 horsepower AC rigs under contract and 234 idle AC FlexRigs available to go to work.","While we aren't building new rigs, we are investing to enhance capabilities that will benefit our customers in this more challenging and complex environment. Not only are we investing to enhance our fleet, we are having great success in partnering with customers and moving new ideas quickly into our operational deployment.","We can do this on a scalable and cost-effective way by leveraging our uniform base of existing FlexRig designs. Our spare capacity combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us great flexibility to invest through the cycle and with our eyes on the future.","Before turning the call to Juan Pablo, I'd like to end by saying this downturn has lingered on for over 20 months and very recently, some respected companies have called the bottom of the market. If that is the case, H&P has the operational capacity to respond quickly, given the investments we have been making in the fleet and our organization throughout the cycle.","Whatever the demand might be going forward, we believe that the strategies we are employing coupled with our financial strength, give us superior competitive footing to grow market share in an improving market. We have the largest spare capacity of 1,500 horsepower AC rigs strategically located in the strongest basins and an unmatched ready state of our rig fleet to return to work.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Juan Pablo.","Juan Tardio","Thank you, John. As reported this morning, the company had a net loss of approximately $21 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, after six consecutive quarters of reduced drilling activity, we are now expecting slight quarter-to-quarter improvements and the number of revenue days during the fourth fiscal quarter.","Following are some details on each of our three drilling segments. Our U.S. land drilling operations generated approximately $26 million in segment operating income during the third fiscal quarter. The number of revenue days declined by approximately 22%, compared to the prior-quarter, resulting in an average of close to 82 rigs generating revenue days during the third fiscal quarter.","On average, approximately 72 of these rigs were under term contract and approximately 10 rigs worked in the spot market.","Excluding the impact of early termination revenues, the average rig revenue per day declined by approximately 5% to $24,684 in the third fiscal quarter, as a proportion of rigs generating revenue days under standby-type day rates increase significantly quarter-to-quarter.","The average rig expense per day decreased by approximately 4% to $13,417, excluding employee severance expenses. The decrease in the average rig expense per day was also attributable to a greater proportion of rigs on standby-type day rates, which was partly offset by expenses related to the growing proportion of total idle rigs. The corresponding average rig margin per day during the third fiscal quarter was $11,267.","The segment generated approximately $81 million in revenues corresponding to early termination of long-term contracts during the third fiscal quarter. Given existing notifications for early terminations, we expect to generate approximately $30 million during the fourth fiscal quarter and over $40 million thereafter in early termination revenues.","Nevertheless, about half of the mentioned early termination revenues that we expect to be recognized after the third fiscal quarter of 2016 are attributable to compensation that, as of June 30, had already been invoiced and collected and that is included in the current liabilities section of our June 30, 2016, balance sheet as deferred revenue. As mentioned in the past, we cannot fully recognize the early termination revenue on a rig until all contractual customer options take that rig back to work at full day rates have expired.","Since the peak in late 2014, we have received early termination notifications for a total of 88 rigs under long-term contracts in the segment, up one rig since our last conference call in early May. Total early termination revenues related to these 88 contracts are now estimated at approximately $466 million, about $88 million of which corresponds to cash flow originally expected to be generated through normal operations during fiscal 2015, $179 million during fiscal 2016 and $199 million after that.","As of today, our 348 available rigs in the U.S. land segment include approximately 91 rigs generating revenue and 257 idle rigs. Included in the 91 rigs generating revenue, are 72 rigs under term contracts, 67 of which are generating revenue days. In addition, 19 rigs are currently active in the spot market, for a total of 86 rigs generating revenue days in the segment, as compared to 78 rigs during our last update in early June.","Nevertheless, approximately 14% of these 86 rigs are now idle and on standby-type day rates, which protect daily margins under long-term contracts. Separately, the five rigs that are not generating revenue days include new build rigs with deliveries that have been delayed in exchange for compensation from customers. Of note, the number of our rigs active in the spot market has increased from eight rigs to 19 rigs since our latest update in early June.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect a quarter-to-quarter increase in the range of 3% to 7% in the number of total revenue days. Excluding the impact of revenues corresponding to early terminated long-term contracts, we expect our average rig revenue per day to decline to approximately $24,000, primarily as a result of a higher proportion of rigs working in the spot market. The average pricing today for the 19 rigs in the spot market is over 35% lower as compared to stock pricing at the peak in late 2014. The average rig expense per day is expected to decrease to roughly $13,300. This expected decrease is primarily attributable to ongoing efforts to effectively manage our costs.","Absent any additional early terminations and excluding the mentioned rigs, for which we have received early termination, notifications. The segment currently have term contract commitments in place for an average of approximately 67 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter, 62 rigs during fiscal 2017 and 34 rigs during fiscal 2018.","The average daily margins for these rigs that are currently under term contracts is expected to remain strong at over $15,000 per day, during the next several quarters as some rigs roll off and the remaining new builds are deployed.","Let me now transition to our offshore operations. Segment operating income slightly declined to approximately $2 million from $3 million during the prior-quarter. Total revenue days declined by about 8% and the average rig margin per day increased by about 1% during the third fiscal quarter to $7,981 per day, excluding employee severance expenses. Most of the rigs that generated revenue during the third fiscal quarter were rigs that remain idle on customer-owned platforms and are generating standby day rates.","As we look at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect quarterly revenue days to slightly increase by approximately 1%, as seven of our nine offshore platform rigs continue to generate revenue days during the quarter. The average rig margin per day is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately $8,000 per day, during the fourth fiscal quarter.","Management contracts on platform rigs continued to contribute to our offshore segment operating income. Excluding, the impact of employee severance expenses, their contribution during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $3 million. Management contracts are [Technical Difficulty] each of the next few quarters.","Moving on to our international land operations. The segment reported operating losses of approximately $5 million during the third fiscal quarter, excluding the impact of employee severance expenses, the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by approximately 12% to $9,461 per day, partly as a result of a greater number of rigs generating standby-type day rates during the third fiscal quarter.","Quarterly revenue days decreased sequentially by approximately 3% to 1,274 days during the same quarter. As of today, our international land segment has 14 rigs generating revenue days including 10 rigs in Argentina, two rigs in the UAE, one rig in Colombia and one rig in Bahrain. All 14 rigs are under long-term contracts. The 24 remaining rigs include 22 rigs that are idle; and two rigs, one rig in Argentina and one rig in Colombia that are now contracted and expected to commence operations during the quarter.","We expect international land quarterly revenue days to increase by approximately 5% to 10% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. And the average rig margin per day to decline to approximately $8,300 per day. As a result of several factors, including a temporary rate reduction for one of our rigs.","Let me now comment on corporate level details. We were pleased to announce last month, a slight increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. As previously discussed, our strong balance sheet and high liquidity position, along with our firm backlog of long-term contract and reduced CapEx requirements should continue to allow us to sustain the level of our regular dividend payments during the foreseeable future.","Excluding rigs with long-term contract that have been early terminated and combining all three of our drilling segments, we currently have an average of approximately 77 rigs under term contracts expected to be active in fiscal 2017, and 47 rigs in fiscal 2018.","Our backlog level as of June 30, 2016, was approximately $2 billion. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million.","We were also pleased to announce earlier this month, a new five-year $300 million revolving credit facility that essentially replaced a very similar facility issued in 2012 that was set to expire in May of 2017.","Over recent years, we have only been using our revolving credit facility to support the issuance of letters of credit. We are reducing our total annual depreciation expense estimate for fiscal 2016 to approximately $565 million. And we are increasing our total general and administrative expenses estimate to approximately $150 million.","The reduction in the depreciation expense estimate is primarily attributable to lower capital expenditure levels and to new arrangements and customer requested delivery delays, related to some of our new build FlexRigs under long-term contracts.","The increase in the G&A expenses estimate for the year is mostly attributable to items related to employee workforce reductions, including required employer 401K plan matching contributions, pension settlements and employee severance expenses.","The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was 63% and we expect the effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 75% to 80% at this point. These effective tax rates are higher than expected, primarily as a result of significantly reduced earnings before taxes, combined with prior-year tax adjustments that impact this year's tax rate, such as the fiscal 2015 adjustment to the domestic production deduction mentioned earlier this year. That resulted from a U.S. tax law change in December 2015, extending bonus depreciation allowances that had expired December 31 of 2014.","You may recall that this bonus depreciation adjustment had a very favorable impact in reducing our cash tax obligations by roughly $60 million. This adjustment allowed us to benefit from a tax refund this year and to currently have a significant prepaid tax balance. The quarter-to-quarter increase in the line item other current assets in our condensed balance sheet is primarily a result of a corresponding increase in prepaid taxes and taxes receivable.","With that, let me turn the call back to John.","John Lindsay","Thank you, Juan Pablo. I thought prior to opening the call for questions, we would provide a little more clarity on the rigs we put to work in the spot market. We've been pleased with our ability to respond quickly to customer requests and provide problem free startups and deliver very safe, efficient and reliable performance on the first wells we drilled. We have reactivated 14 rigs in the spot market, 10 rigs are FlexRig 3s and four rigs are FlexRig 5s, and approximately 75% are pad capable with 7,500 psi capability.","In addition, we've added six new customers in the past quarter. One of the benefits of a downturn is having more opportunities to introduce and attract new customers to FlexRig technology. So, we're hopeful the market has made its bottom; but regardless of the timing, we will continue to make every effort to emerge from this as a stronger company for customers, employees and shareholders.","And Keith, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Lindsay","I'm sorry, Angie, we're having difficulty.","Angie Sedita","Can you \u2013 there you go. Is that better?","John Lindsay","Yes. Thank you.","Angie Sedita","So, good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Angie Sedita","John, you made a couple of comments on the cycle, and the first one you said is that the customers remain optimistic. And clearly, you put 14 rigs here back to the market at the spot rate. Have you seen any change of incoming calls or the pace of conversations as far as interest in adding rigs into the back half of the year? Are the customers just as interested as coming back? Are you seeing a little bit of delays until later in the year or even 2017?","John Lindsay","Well, I think, I don't know that we've seen any significant change in call volume over the last several weeks, obviously, we're all painfully aware that, that oil continues to pull back.","But I think, in general, I described our customers is continuing to be very disciplined in their focus, looking at performance and reliability. I do think, all along, it seems like, at least many of our larger customers have been more focused on probably a September, October, November, timeframe. I think starting at the earliest in September.","Obviously, we've had some other customers, as I described, we've got some new customers on board and we put a few rigs to work for them. So, that's been a positive. But, I think, in general, I think we all saw the optimism, there is some concern and I think drives a little bit of lower confidence levels as it relates to this lower oil price environment.","Angie Sedita","Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And then you made the comments about investing through the cycle, which you certainly have in prior cycles. So, when you think forward into 2017 and 2018 and specifically 2017, could you restart at a slow level your new construction within the organization? And if so, what rig design would you focus on?","John Lindsay","Well, we definitely have the capability, Angie. As we've mentioned previously, we're utilizing that manufacturing capability today. And we have really throughout the downturn, but we've been utilizing that manufacturing capability to upgrade rigs with 7,500 psi, some setback upgrades, just overall looking at upgrading the fleet as needed in order to meet the challenges.","Clearly, we could start backup and get our manufacturing capability up and running. It wasn't that long that we just delivered that last new build. So, we can sure do that. Obviously, there is, from a timing perspective, we could do that in 2017, we could do it in 2018, obviously, it's going to require, I think a \u2013 it's going to require a strong enough market to deliver much higher day rates and what we see today.","I think, in terms of the rig that we would build, I would think more than likely it would be FlexRig 5s as well as some other ideas that we have out there that \u2013 obviously, there is not the market to build those style of rigs into. But, again, in an improving market, in a market that required more AC drive rigs or at least quality AC drive rigs, I think we'd be very well positioned to respond to that.","Angie Sedita","Absolutely, with your fleet. And then, as a follow-up on that, you obviously unstacked 14 rigs here pretty quickly. Are you seeing any bottlenecks on the people side or equipment side? Any thoughts there?","John Lindsay","No, I don't see any bottlenecks. The people side has been very good, as we've mentioned before. We obviously have a lot of very experienced employees on the rigs, and I think obviously everybody does. But, we have a lot of men that are ready to step back up into their previous position, step back into rig manager jobs and driller jobs and [indiscernible] positions. So, really no issues at all. It's been very good; again, it's been efficient, it's been safe. And I think it's obviously encouraging for everybody in the field to see some rigs going back to work. So, the morale obviously has improved; and, again, we're prepared, we can respond pretty quickly, and there's no equipment bottlenecks that I can think of.","Angie Sedita","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much, John. I'll turn it over.","John Lindsay","All right, Angie. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Timna Tanners","There have been a lot of comments in this earnings season about E&P customers needing to get prepared to pay up for services. Wanted to get your thoughts on how to think about pricing power and what it might take to be able to lift day rates?","John Lindsay","Yeah. That's a good question. Obviously, everybody would like to have greater insight into that. I think, we've \u2013 we've felt pretty \u2013 or consistently said that coming off of bottom, pricing is going to be highly competitive.","At the same time, as we described in our remarks, the drilling environment is becoming more and more complex, which means that, contractors are having to upgrade rigs. And so, I think, that in and of itself would potentially drive some higher rates \u2013 again, not right off the bottom, but maybe earlier in the cycle. We've described or it's been described as 700 AC rigs, that are 1,500 horsepower and I think \u2013 what is it around 250 rigs or so, that are working today? Ballpark range, 250 rigs to 300 rigs.","So clearly, they'll need to be some rigs that will go back \u2013 need to go back to work in order to begin to drive pricing power; but again, I think this cycle is much different than previous cycles, because the legacy rigs, really aren't playing a role in that. They are drilling, I don't believe those rigs are targeting the more complex well designs.","Most of the mechanical rigs, I think over 70% of the mechanical rigs that have been reactivated since the bottom of the cycle, assuming that is the bottom of the cycle, most of those are going to vertical type work.","So, I know it's not a direct answer. I don't think anybody has the direct answer; but I think, in general, it's going to be different than previous cycles. I do think pricing kicks in at a much lower rig count than what we've seen historically.","Timna Tanners","Okay. That's fair. And along those same lines, do you find in your conversations with customers that you're exclusively negotiating on price? Or do you find that they're really having more of an appetite to discuss the characteristics of the rig and the greater productivity of the rig? Or is it really still focused on price?","John Lindsay","Well, I think clearly they're going to be interested in both. One way, I would describe it is, it's a value proposition discussion. So, I think, when you think about it in those terms, there is always an element of \u2013 there is an element of cost and there is an element of the value that you can provide, in terms of \u2013 obviously, safety is key and reliability is key and the type of rig is key. And then, I think also having a track record of performance.","So, again day rates in the spot market today are, I would describe as soft. I mean I think we've mentioned 35% off of the peak. And that's similar to what we saw. I think it was 30% back in 2009. So, I think we're starting at a similar place, but clearly the market is different in terms of the types of wells that we're going to be drilling.","Timna Tanners","All right. Thank you.","John Lindsay","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead","Hi, gentlemen. How are you?","John Lindsay","Hi, Kurt.","Juan Tardio","Hi, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Great. I appreciate, as always, the color commentary. So, I just want to get a general sense from you guys that \u2013 a lot of discussion, continues discussion about pad optimal rigs and pad rigs. I think the last time that you and I, as a group, had a chance to visit, you mentioned that you didn't have any kind of pad rigs in your inventory, because you're not getting any, really, demand pull from that side from the E&P. So, I was wondering if you could just provide a little color on the market dynamics and what is it that your customers are really looking for in the land rig these days.","John Lindsay","Kurt, I want to clarify, you had, you mentioned that we don't have any pad rigs in our inventory, are you talking about the walking...","Kurt Hallead","Yes, walking, walking, yeah, walking. Yeah.","John Lindsay","Okay.","Kurt Hallead","Yeah.","John Lindsay","Yeah. No, I think, of course, we're always thinking about it and we get questions, it's interesting as I was coming in this morning and kind of thinking about how long this has been talked about. I think it's actually going back to 2013.","So from one perspective, from our perspective, there really isn't much of a debate to be had, because of the number of new rigs that we've built since 2013 that are skid system, FlexRig \u2013 additions on to our Flex 3s and then the FlexRig 5. And of course, we've had the FlexRig 4s for years and years.","But we've also said, Kurt, that if the market or if customers decide to begin or say to HP, hey, if you really need to have a walking application, and we have the capability, we have the designs, it's just a matter of doing it. I don't see it impacting our activity, go back to the 14 rigs that we just put to work; 10 rigs Flex 3s, four rigs Flex 5s, 75% of those rigs are in our view are optimized for drilling on pads, and obviously the customers are thinking that as well. So, does that answer your question, Kurt?","Kurt Hallead","Yeah, I think, I think, generally, and \u2013 yeah, there has been discussion about walking rigs and a preference for walking rigs, along with some other elements of the package. And being the largest land drilling player out there, clearly walking rigs is not the best majority of what the market is or what's in E&P. So, I really just trying to gain some insight. Is that walking capability absolutely necessary? Or is it something that's more like a nice to have?","John Lindsay","Well, I wouldn't, well, clearly just based on our track record and working with customers. It's not an absolute necessity. Are there going to be applications for walking, applications in the future, for us I think there's a possibility, yes, that could be the case. But, it's not a situation where you're eliminated from contention and competing, if you don't have a walking system. Again, I think we've been able to demonstrate that.","Kurt Hallead","Got it. Okay. Great. That's great color. Thanks, John.","Juan Tardio","And, Kurt, if I may add, this is Juan Pablo. Just to clarify, we have close to 190 of our FlexRigs that are pad capable, and we believe optimal for multiple well pad drilling applications. That's over 50% of our existing fleet in the U.S. land. And I just wanted to make sure that we provide the clarity that we do have a solution that we believe is better, or at least comparable to the walking systems that you are referring to.","John Lindsay","And I also believe that of the rigs that are working, that we have operating today 75% of those are pad. And again, in our view optimized for pad and I think our customers would agree with that.","Kurt Hallead","Great. Maybe just one follow-up, guys. Appreciate that color. So, you mentioned that spot pricing is 35% lower than the peak in late 2014. I think the last time, if I'm not mistaken, it was down 30%. So, we had some degradation, I guess, during the course of the June quarter. Are we at a point now where pricing is going to stabilize?","John Lindsay","Well, well we hope, obviously we hope so. But, I'm not convinced if that's going to be the case. Again, a lot of rumors and a lot of things that you hear on some really low rates that are being thrown around out there that, when you hear about jobs that you've lost, it's hard to say whether that's accurate information. But as I said, a little earlier. I believe coming right off of bottom, which we still are, it's going to be highly competitive and there will be some irrational pricing that will take place.","I think eventually that begins to work itself out, after putting a number of rigs to work. And in particularly, when you see some early examples of companies with low rates and low performing rigs, that's not a good combination when you're drilling the types of wells that are being drilled out there. And I think that's really what you'll see and I think that has the impact of beginning to improve pricing.","Kurt Hallead","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Juan Tardio","Thanks, Kurt.","John Lindsay","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Marc Bianchi","Thank you. Thanks for providing the margin commentary as it relates to the long-term contracts. Can you say where that $15,000 was in the last couple quarters? Has it been pretty steady? I understand the outlook is for it to be pretty steady but just curious where it was last couple quarters?","Juan Tardio","Thanks, Marc. This is Juan Pablo. That is correct. It has been pretty steady. As a matter of fact, it's been slightly going up over time over the last several quarters as we have rigs rolls off and new builds deployed, et cetera. The new mix is driving a slightly higher average there.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. And that just to be clear, how many rigs does that apply to? I think there's 72 under term contract, but there's some that are on the deferred delivery bucket. Can you just clarify what that $15,000 per day applies to?","Juan Tardio","Yes. It applies to 67 that are generating revenue days that were mentioned.","Marc Bianchi","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Juan Tardio","And as we move forward, you heard us talk about how many rigs we expect or we already have under term contracts for fiscal 2017 and for fiscal 2018, those rigs also are generating that type of margins.","Marc Bianchi","Right. Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe just moving over to international, it sounded like the margin decline \u2013 you called out the rate reduction, but then there were some other factors. I guess, could you say how much of the margin decline comes from the rate reduction and then maybe comment on the other factors, if perhaps it's mix or whatever might be going on there?","Juan Tardio","This is Juan Pablo again, I don't have that exact information in front of me. As we've mentioned, we have a situation where we've had some rigs go to standby-type day rates that has impacted our margins. We've had a reduction as well, temporary reduction for one rig. Those are some of the higher impact items, but I'm sorry I can't provide greater granularity than that.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. Can you say when the temporary reduction goes back to the original rate?","Juan Tardio","We expect that to happen during this quarter.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe just one more, if I could \u2013 I know that this has come up before and you guys have offered some thoughts. But, in terms of the deferred tax liability, if there isn't any new building going on, but you are generating positive net income or positive pre-tax income, how should we think about how that liability winds down over time?","Juan Tardio","Well, it's currently at around $1.4 billion, slightly under that. As we've said \u2013 I believe late last year, we would expect it to remain in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion through the end of fiscal 2017. So, we don't see any significant changes.","If we were to assume that CapEx once again increases during the following years to anywhere \u2013 near where the depreciation levels, financial depreciation levels might be, then that liability level would remain relatively flat.","If we have a very low CapEx environment for a long time or several years, then it's a very long tail, but slowly during those years you would see that liability decline. But, in no significant way that would impact our liquidity to the point that, that we would be concerned at this point.","Marc Bianchi","Yeah. You guys certainly have a lot of room there. Okay. Thank you very much.","Juan Tardio","Thank you.","John Lindsay","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","We'll go next to Rob MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital.","Rob MacKenzie","Thanks, guys. With 75% of the new rigs put back to work, to your words, John, pad capable with 7,500 psi mud systems, can you give us a feeling for, A, how many of your remaining idle rigs are similarly kitted out as well as any kind of estimate you have for the broader market?","John Lindsay","Well, Juan Pablo mentioned a few moments ago about the number of, I think, he mentioned a number of idle pad capable rigs. Maybe you were just talking total, that would be total, the idle number of pad capable would be 119.","Juan Tardio","Yeah. So, a significant number, Rob. We do have pad rigs with 7,500 psi that are idle. For competitive reasons, we haven't shared that with anyone we did talk about the rigs that we put to work. Obviously, we're continuing to add 7,500 psi systems. But, we haven't shared that. Was there another part of your question that I missed?","Rob MacKenzie","Any of the broader market for that \u2013 it sounds like, given the fact that you are adding the 7,500 psi capability as well as others, that there is a potential scarcity of rigs with that spec. Is that fair?","John Lindsay","My impression is that is fair. I think it's another element of this 1,500 horsepower AC rig. And the other capabilities. It's not just 7,500 psi, it's also upgrading setback capacity to be able to handle, as an example, 25,000 foot of setback of five-inch drill pipe. And not all AC rigs are capable of handling that sort of a setback upgrade.","And so, then you begin to ask yourself, do you really want to invest in 7,500 psi and then not also be able to do the setback. So, there is a lot of variability. Fortunately for us, we have that capability with our engineering staff. And as I mentioned earlier, the manufacturing capability, I think we're able to do that much more efficiently and more cost effectively than most. But no \u2013 I do \u2013 I think it's going to be a bigger driver. I don't think it's a situation where every rig necessarily needs 7,500 psi, but you'll begin to see more and more.","Rob MacKenzie","Thank you. And on those rigs with 7,500 psi, about what portion would you say are utilizing a third mud pump these days?","John Lindsay","I think it's a relatively small percentage. I really don't have \u2013 again, it's one of those things that we haven't, we purposely haven't shared for competitive reasons. But I think, just in general, there's less demand for that third pump as compared to the demand for the 7,500 two pump operation.","Rob MacKenzie","Okay. And if you don't mind, do you mind sharing how long it would take you to say, convert a Flex 3 to the 7,500 psi with the setback you mentioned and what the cost might be?","John Lindsay","Well, again, we have some upgrades ongoing. So, obviously, it's a demand pull basis. From my perspective, it's kind of irrelevant for us as far as how much time. I think we're \u2013 maybe away for us to summarize it is, we have the capacity to deliver based on what we think the demand is going to be. As far as total costs, Juan Pablo, I don't know.","Juan Tardio","I don't have the latest on that. John, sorry.","John Lindsay","Ballpark it just seems like it's in the $750,000 to $1 million range, I think that's a ballpark range. I think that's probably close enough.","Rob MacKenzie","Okay. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it back.","John Lindsay","All right, Rob. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.","Sean Meakim","Hi, good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning, Sean.","Juan Tardio","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Meakim","So, I just wanted to talk a little bit about this cycle versus the prior. You noted earlier a very different cycle on pricing, given the big shift in rig mix toward AC. Obviously, this downturn also much different in terms of the duration, the level which could be a trough here. Does any of that change how you think about your strategy in terms of contracting terms, duration and things like that? How do you think about building that portfolio effectively as we go in the other direction?","John Lindsay","Well, you summarized it very well. This downturn is entirely different and the reality is even though there is many that have called the bottom and we all hope that they are right, the fact is, we've had continued softness with oil over the last several weeks.","I think, as you think about rigs that we have that are rolling off of term contract, it could be that some of those rigs we would be interested in \u2013 if the customer were interested in entering into term contract. I think for the foreseeable future, it's hard to really get your arms around, being able to enter into any sort of a term contract commitment unless that's exactly what the customer wants to do. The contractor is not going to be the one making that decision or having any control over that.","Clearly, we'd have some interest in some term contracts, if the day rate was reasonable. I think the other element, which again, I think I've already mentioned is, we've got these new investments that are happening as well. And there is a limited amount of that that you can do before you begin to get higher rates and a commitment of term.","Sean Meakim","Got it. That makes sense. And then the 14 rigs that you've picked up thus far \u2013 could you maybe give us a little more granularity just as we're trying to get a better sense of the underlying activity, maybe rigs that were negotiated versus bid? Are you seeing the same customers come back to some of these rigs that have been idled? Just trying to get a better sense of the underlying activity.","John Lindsay","Well, I don't have a lot of additional granularity. I do believe that eight of those rigs \u2013 eight rigs of the 14 rigs were in the Permian, and there were a couple in Niobrara and there were \u2013 there was, I think a couple in Oklahoma, one in Haynesville, and maybe one in Piceance, I mean, they were \u2013 but again, the majority of the demand is coming out of the Permian. You guys \u2013 anything else that you can think of to add color-wise?","Juan Tardio","No. Did that address your question, Sean. I'm sure I might have missed a specific.","Sean Meakim","No, it's not a big deal. I was just trying to get a sense for were these negotiated with customers, or any of them bids that you won? Are you seeing some customers requesting rigs they had previously used as they go back to work? Just trying to get a little bit more sense of...","John Lindsay","Sure. Yeah. I think \u2013 again, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but my sense is that many of those were negotiated. I do think there were some bids. I think, there was a question earlier and some customers are different, but where we have our greatest opportunity to pickup share or pickup as I said that we have six new customers in those rigs that we put back to work, which is pretty significant.","But when they're looking at the value proposition and they're not just looking at the rate, which most companies don't, particularly the larger, but we're starting to see even some smaller operators that we've developed a really good relationship with and they've seen the value.","And so, I think that's \u2013 that weighs in a lot, is having that ability to sit down with the customer and kind of go through the process and talk more about the value proposition that you can provide. And so, that's always helpful. That's really about the amount of clarity that we have in those details.","Sean Meakim","That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","John Lindsay","Okay.","Juan Tardio","Thank you, Sean.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead, Scott.","Scott Gruber","Good morning.","John Lindsay","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","Just coming back quickly to the rig upgrade line of questions, John, I think it was you, you mentioned about $750,000 to $1 million upgrade. That's just for the pipe retrofit and the setback, et cetera. that does not include this skid system? Is that correct?","John Lindsay","Correct.","Scott Gruber","And then if you were going to add a skid system, as memory serves, they used the cost around $1 million. Is that still the case or has that come down?","John Lindsay","I think that's still in the ballpark. Yeah, I don't think that's changed much.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And then is it safe to say that \u2013 I know you're not going to give us the exact number of rigs you have in the sweet spot of demand today. But, is it safe to say that you are long on the skid side, much longer on skid systems versus 7,500 circulating systems?","John Lindsay","Yes. We had mentioned earlier, the number of pad, rigs that we have, and we don't have that many 7,500 psi. We do have a pretty fair amount; but again, I'm not going to give that kind of granularity. But, clearly, the 7,500 \u2013 while we've had 7,500 psi mud pumps, systems for years, I mean, literally, I can remember a few new builds we've built probably five years ago. But, the fact is that, the systems were very seldom used to their full capability.","Well, today, they're being used at a much higher level, and again, it's been driven by these much longer laterals, kind of the extended type laterals that we're talking about. So, that's what's driving that. But again, like I said, I think we're positioned pretty well based on the demand that we think we could possibly see in an improving market that we would be very well positioned to add enough systems to fulfill the demand that we would expect.","Scott Gruber","And you're hugely advantaged today, because you have long cash that you can make the upgrade investment without thinking about payback. As the industry starts to shift towards upgrading and thinking about payback on the upgrades, how do you think others will think about that payback? Will they look for a one year, will they settle for a two year to three year?","John Lindsay","Well, that's a tough one, Scott, because, I mean, it's hard to say what others would do. I know what we've typically done, I mean, you can look at our track record in terms of new builds and these kind of investments over time. And that would be our expectation in an improving market, is that we're going to get the return on our investment. Juan Pablo, you have any other \u2013 anything to...","Juan Tardio","Yeah. I agree, I mean, we've proven over the years that we pay a lot of attention to returns as we invest new cash. We've been very prudent in that regard. You have to compare that to what our competitors have done. But, overall, I think it's fair to expect that some investment will take place and folks will have different levels of discipline.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Thank you.","John Lindsay","Thanks.","Operator","And it does appear we have no further questions at this time. I'll return the floor to you Mr. Lindsay for closing remarks.","John Lindsay","Okay. Thank you, Keith. I want to thank each of you for joining us on the call today. And before signing off, I want to leave you with a few final thoughts. As we've said, we think we're very well positioned as a result of our strong balance sheet. We have the largest and most modern fleet of AC drive rigs in the industry, and we have what we believe the best people in the business that are committed to delivering value to customers and shareholders.","We believe we are in a great position to continue to gain market share going forward. And with that, we will sign off until next time. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation, you may now disconnect and have a great day."]}}
