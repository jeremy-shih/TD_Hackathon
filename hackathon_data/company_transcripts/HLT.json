Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Christian Charnaux, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, Mr. Charnaux.","Christian Charnaux","Thank you, Sally. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide second quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we begin, we'd like remind you that our discussion this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today.","We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of 2014. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report another quarter of great results, highlighted by strong topline revenue growth, fee growth and ownership segment performance, which led the results at the top end of our guidance range. We continue to feel very good about the macro set up for the remainder of the year and as a result, we've raised our full year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance.","In the second quarter we exceeded the high-end of our guidance on system-wide comp RevPAR growth up 6.7% on a currency neutral basis, growth was driven by a 4% increase in average rate, a 2 percentage point increase in occupancy to 78%.","Strong growth in transient demand combined with continued group performance delivered solid RevPAR growth for the quarter. Transient revenue grew over 7% system-wide. In the U.S. we saw particular strength with rack RevPAR in the quarter, up 14%.","Government business also stabilized up over 3% year-over-year in the U.S. after five consecutive quarters of decline. Group revenue in the quarter was in line with expectations up 5% system-wide in the Americas and we continue to expect pickup in the back half of the year based on strong group revenue position, at both our Big 8 and a larger set of U.S. managed hotels. Our group revenue position for both the third and fourth quarter is up in the mid to high single digits.","In Europe, strong group performance in the U.K., Italy and Portugal continue to drive positive momentum. As we look to the first half of 2015, we are seeing a similarly positive story with group revenue position up 8% across all U.S. full-service and luxury properties.","Ancillary revenue growth continued as expected in the quarter with SMB at our owned and managed hotel on track to grow at roughly the same rate as RevPAR for the full year. We saw continued growth in group spend with ancillary revenues per group room up 14% in the quarter for the Big 8 and over 12% across all of our owned hotels in the Americas.","Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $651 million, an increase of over 10% from the second quarter of 2013 and at the upper end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points versus the second quarter of 2013.","Now turning to development highlights, we maintained our number one ranking in key categories according to Smith Travel Research, including rooms under construction in every major region of the world, pipeline size and system-wide room.","We continue to have great success in growing our system offer largest space of rooms in the industry. In the quarter we opened 56 hotels and over 8,000 rooms and 107 hotel and 17,000 rooms through Q2.","As of quarter end, we had 694,000 rooms operating globally and with the opening of the Hilton Garden Inn Astana in Kazakhstan, we've increased our global presence to 93 countries and territories.","In terms of rooms under construction, we had 540 -- 542 hotels and 106,000 rooms at quarter that will soon be added to our system, all of which are in our capital like management and franchise segment. This gives us an 18% share of all rooms under construction globally or approximately 4 times our share of existing supply.","Our industry leading pipeline continues to grow, increasing by 18% over the 12 months ended June 30, now with 1,230 hotels and approximately 210,000 rooms in 75 countries and territories.","For comparability, including all deals approved but not signed, our pipeline would have been over 230,000 rooms. In the second quarter, we approved 135-hotel with over 21,000 rooms for development.","And what we believe will add significantly to our growth overtime. We recently launched our newest brand, Curio, a collection by Hilton. We believe that Curio will further enhance our ability to serve existing customers and attract new one through collection of unique four to five star hotel.","For owners, affiliation with our commercial engines should drive significant market share premiums and distribution cost efficiency. For Hilton, we see a market opportunity of over 1,200 hotels globally and expect eventually to have hundreds of Curio\u2019s in the portfolio. We expect our first Curio to open this fall.","The developer response to Curio has been extraordinary. We've already reach agreement on nine properties comprising more than 4,100 rooms, including the SLS Las Vegas Hotel & Casino and a project in Doha, Qatar, and we have more than 75 Curio\u2019s globally in various stages of discussion.","Clearly, curio our 11th brand is off to a strong start and we are still on track to launch our 12th brand in a space we call accessible lifestyle by the end of the year. Owner interest continued to be very strong with this new brand as well.","These new brands will add further momentum to the opening of fee paying rooms. We increased our system size in the quarter by over 7,000 net rooms, or over 15,000 net rooms in the first half of the year, all with the minimus amounts of capital investment by us and without any acquisitions.","Brand strength is the key driver to our asset-light strategy. We continue to believe we have the strongest brand portfolio in the industry and our portfolio is getting even stronger as we grew our global RevPAR index 100 basis points year-over-year for the quarter, 70% of which was driven from rate. In fact, every one of our brands grew their global RevPAR index this quarter.","Our leading brand strength is also evident in the annual J.D. Power 2014 North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index study where Homewood and Hilton Garden Inn brands placed first in their segment. They are 11th and 10th wins respectively. Our brands have earned 34 first-place awards in 1999 significantly more than any multi-brand lodging company.","Additionally, in the 2014 customer service Hall of Fame survey sponsored by USA Today, Hilton worldwide was voted the top-rated hotel company in the United States for customer service and the number two company in customer service across all industry survey.","Technology is of course the key enabler of superior guest experiences and our guest expectations have been evolving very quickly in this area. Earlier this week we introduced the significant technological milestone for the company, one that is representative of our depth, talent and agility for the first time in the industry.","Our guests can check-in using their Hilton managed account on a mobile device, tablet or computer and choose their exact room from digital floor plans before arriving at their hotel.","Guests will also be able to customize their stay by purchasing upgrade, by making special request for items to be delivered to their room and even by checking out of the hotel, all using their personal technology devices.","These capabilities will be available at U.S.-based Hilton worldwide properties across six of our brands by the end of this summer and by the end of 2014, guests at more than 4,000 properties in 80 plus countries can experience this new technology. Based on data and feedback from our customers, we know that they want this level of control over their travel experiences.","Moving forward we will give guests even more choice and control with the ability to use their smartphones as a room key. We've spent the last few years testing and developing proprietary technology and we are pleased to announce that by the end of 2015 all U.S. hotels across four brands will have this capability, with the entire global portfolio of brands following soon thereafter. We believe this will revolutionize the hotel experience for our guests and will deliver significant return on investment for our owners as we execute this initiative at scale.","Now let me update you on the outlook for the remainder of 2014. As we look at the macroeconomic picture and outlook for lodging performance around the world, we see very favorable conditions in the majority of our markets with uncertainty in some regions only moderately weighing an overall result.","In U.S. we continue to expect moderate GDP growth coupled with historically low levels of supply to continue to drive very strong fundamentals. Given such favorable backdrop we are maintaining our high single-digit RevPAR growth expectations for 2014.","For the Americas region outside the U.S., we expect continued growth in Mexico and South America to support high single-digit RevPAR increases for the full year 2014. Europe continues to benefit from strong group performance and steady transient gain, particularly as rebounding fundamentals in the southern region and easy year-over-year comparisons in Turkey offset softness in France.","While we continue to monitor the ongoing uncertainty in Eastern Europe, our relatively limited exposure to the region should mitigate near-term risk. We remain confident in our mid single-digit European RevPAR growth expectations for the full year full year 2014.","Moving on to the Middle East, Africa region, we expect geopolitical tensions to continue a way on travel demand. Our outlook largely assumes a steady-state and we anticipate flat RevPAR in the region for 2014 as a positive booking pace and easy comparisons in Egypt, some what mitigate challenges elsewhere in the region.","Lastly Asia-Pacific continues to benefit from strength in Japan and China, with second quarter GDP growth in China of 7.5% coming in modestly above expectations and stimulus measures supporting Beijing's commitment to growth within this range. We\u2019re confident that solid performance will continue to offset challenges such as weakness in Thailand leading to mid single-digit RevPAR growth for the overall region.","Given strength in the Americas and APAC, and the continued rebound in Europe, we remain optimistic heading into the back half of the year. We\u2019re confident that our award-winning brands and industry-leading commercial services platform will enable our global portfolio to deliver RevPAR in 5.5% to 7% range for the full year.","Furthermore, we continue to forecast net unit growth of 5.5% to 6.5% in the management franchise segment equating to 35,000 to 40,000 rooms. In light of our positive outlook, we\u2019re raising our adjust EBITDA to $2,425 billion to $2,475 billion, an increase of $10 million at the midpoint. Our diluted earnings per share guidance for the year increase to a range of $0.67 to $0.70 or an increase of $0.03 a share.","In summary, we had an excellent quarter posting results at the top end of our guidance range and outperforming our primary competitors on the topline, margins, bottom-line and capital like net unit growth.","We also continue to deploy free cash flow to prepay debt and build equity value with total prepayments $600 million year-to-date. We feel great about the fundamentals of the business and our positioning for the remainder of this year and for next year.","Now, let me turn the call over to Kevin Jacobs. He will discuss the quarter's financial performance in a bit more detail.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our results for the second quarter, which came in at the high-end of our expectations. For the second quarter 2014, diluted earnings per share totaled $0.21, ahead of our guidance of $0.18 to $0.20.","Total management and franchise fees were $371 million in the second quarter, an increase of 14% over the second quarter of 2013, driven by both new units and topline growth. Franchise fees continued to perform strongly up 15% in the quarter.","Given the strength to-date and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re increasing our comparable management franchise -- management and franchise fee growth estimates by 100 basis points to 11% to 13%.","In our ownership segment, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of $291 million was 8% higher year-over-year, adjusted for our non-comp increase in affiliate fees. This performance was driven by U.S. RevPAR growth for the segment of 6.4% and strong operating margin growth at owned hotels globally which grew nearly 150 basis points excluding non-comp affiliate fees.","Our timeshare segment continues its transition to a more capital light business with third-party developed interval comprising 57% of sales in the quarter and representing about 82% of our total supply at quarter end.","Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $69 million was 15% better than prior year, driven by favorable transient rental and club revenue and margin growth, higher sales and marketing and G&A contribution and higher owned and fee-for-service sales","Corporate expense and other was $80 million in the second quarter compared to $67 million in the prior year. The majority of this increase in net expense relates to incremental public company costs including stock compensation expense, which as we discussed last quarter are not evenly distributed throughout the year. We continued to expect growth for the segment of 3% to 5% for the full year.","In terms of our regional performance, strong performance in the Americas was slightly muted by weakness in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Thailand. In the U.S, continued economic strength drove comparable RevPAR growth of 7.3% with rate accounting for nearly two-thirds of the increase.","We saw the strong growth despite the Easter shift which negatively affected growth by more than a point. U.S. focus service brand were particularly strong with 7.9% RevPAR growth in the quarter, up from 6.7% in Q1.","We attribute these solid U.S. results to continued strong fundamentals and robust demand. Particularly in California and the Pacific Northwest where saw RevPAR increases of over 10%.","Additionally, Florida benefited from both strong transient and group demand which drove RevPAR gains of nearly 12% and Boston performed well, especially over Marathon Weekend in April.","U.S. owned hotels grew RevPAR 6.4%, boosted by strong performance in San Francisco and Hawaii. Conversely, our owned hotels in Chicago and New Orleans were adversely affected by softer group volumes given fewer city-wide in those markets.","Our hotel in the Americas outside of the U.S. posted a very strong quarter with comparable year-over-year RevPAR up over 8%. Results were driven by strength in Mexico and Brazil.","In Asia-Pacific, RevPAR increased nearly 5%, driven almost equally by occupancy and rate gains. Similar to Q1 results were boosted by strong performance at our hotel in Japan and Korea, where comp owned and operated RevPAR increased over 16%.","Greater China grew RevPAR over 7% due in part the solid performance in Hong Kong. APAC results were tempered however by softness in Thailand and Singapore.","In Europe, RevPAR increased 4.4% primarily due to increased occupancy, with the exception of strong performance at certain group hotels in the U.K., northern countries remained challenged throughout the quarter and France continued to struggle. However, rebounding fundamentals in the Southern and Mediterranean hotels largely offset these challenges.","Athens for instance was up more than 18%. Portugal increased RevPAR an impressive 57% as its corporate meeting business saw robust growth. Additionally, we improved our RevPAR index by 170 basis points in Europe versus the second quarter of 2013.","Finally, in the Middle East and Africa RevPAR declined 3.4% for the quarter as political strains, visa restrictions in Saudi Arabia and a resurgence of the MERS virus fear -- of MERS virus fears continued to negatively affect travel demand.","Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to reduce our leverage, working towards our objective to achieve investment grade status by using substantially all of our free cash flow to prepay debt and in turn build equity value for our shareholders.","In the quarter, we made voluntary prepayments of $250 million on our term loan, with an additional payment of $150 million in July, which brought our total debt prepayments to $600 million year-to-date.","As a result of continued strong performance, we're increasing our expected debt prepayment range by $100 billion to $800 million to $1 billion for the year. We also priced the second timeshare ABS transaction during the quarter, with the majority of the proceeds being used to repay our timeshare warehouse facility.","We believe that the market reacted very well to the offering, which would significantly upside the $350 million and price that in all in fixed rate of 1.81%. In fact, the transaction price at the tightest weighted average pricing spread and the highest advance rate of any timeshare offering done since the financial crisis, which we think is another strong endorsement of the quality of our timeshare customer and platform.","We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $829 million, including $284 million of restricted cash and had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolving credit facility.","We also executed a successful secondary equity offering of $103.5 million shares during the quarter, generating a total of more than 2.3 billion of gross proceeds to Blackstone. For help in the offering have dual benefit of diversifying our shareholder base and increasing our flow, which roughly doubled as a result of the offering.","Finally, let's turn to our outlook for 2014. For the full year, as Chris mentioned, we are maintaining our system-wide RevPAR guidance of between 5.5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on the same basis.","We're increasing our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS, expecting a range of between $2,425 billion and $2.475 billion and EPS adjusted for special items of between $0.67 and $0.70 for the full year. As noted, we expect management franchise fees to increase between 11% and 13%.","We are maintaining our full year timeshare segment adjusted EBITA guidance of $315 million to $330 million and CapEx spending excluding timeshare inventory will total approximately $350 million, including about $250 million to $260 million hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue.","For the third quarter of 2014, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5.5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $610 million and $630 million, and diluted EPS of $0.15 to 17% -- $0.17, sorry.","Further detail on our second quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks and we are now interested in answering any questions you may have. So that we make speak to as many of you as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sally, could we have our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning, Shaun.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America","I just want, Chris or Kevin, I just wanted to ask about the outlook for the back half year. So when we look at your 5.5% to 7%, that\u2019s actually below what we are seeing for some of the peers out there and so I just want a little bit of color since you did come in at the high-end of everyone. I think across the global hotel peer set for the [C-Corp] (ph) for the second quarter? What are you guys seeing now, does that brand mix and group in terms of the outlook or do you think that just overall conservatism?","Chris Nassetta","No. I mean, I think, Shaun, good question, I mean, I think, if you look at our guidance for the full year, I believe we are at the midpoint the highest in the industry, which we think is reflective of our performance, which if you look at the last couple quarters and including second quarter numbers, we just gave you are beating the competition. So I think, we feel really good about the second half of the year.","Transient business, as we discussed in Q2 is great. We see no reason why it\u2019s not going to continue. I discussed -- I described sort of the group position in both the big hotels and the broader group of managed hotels in the back half, both third and fourth quarter being strong. So we feel good about the second half of your performance. And obviously, with our midpoint highest in the industry, we feel good about that. And obviously, our objective is try and -- it would be to try and outperform that and try and perform at the higher levels of what we\u2019ve given you.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joe Greff - JPMorgan","Good morning, guys.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Greff - JPMorgan","Chris, you had mentioned that the pipeline increased 18% year-over-year and we actually saw nice sequential growth 2Q end versus 1Q end. Can you talk at a high level view what brands or geographies you're seeing incremental interest in and that represents either that year-over-year or sequential change? And then on the topic of my second question, my follow-up is on the topic of net rooms growth, which you guys outpaced both your large cap lodging Citicorp peers on. When you think about next year and you\u2019re thinking about the pipeline build, and I'm not sure if you want to get into sort of guidance related question for 2015, but directionally it would be intuitive that your net rooms growth or your net room addition would accelerate. And I guess how are you just probably thinking about that at this point as well? Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. Happy to handle both. In terms of pipeline and where we are seeing the growth, I think it\u2019s generally across the globe. We continue to have good to see great progress in all the major regions around the world. The U.S. has picked up probably as a percentage matter a little bit more than the rest of the world for us. That\u2019s because the U.S. story right now is almost entirely a limited service story. We think we have the best limited service brands in the business that we\u2019re getting far more than our fair share. I mean, we\u2019re getting 20-plus percent of the deals and we\u2019re 10% of the market.","So, in terms of rooms under construction, so the U.S. has picked up a little bit more, but we talked about many times, the strategy is really with -- this great geographic distribution that we have and this great change scale distribution that we have is to really be strategic about how we deploy brands around the world, the right brands at the right time based on conditions in the market and customer demand. And so we are continuing to see broad pick up across the world and all the major regions. As I said little bit heavier percentage wise in the U.S.","I think you're right and then I don't want to get into giving guidance for 2015 while I am sitting here in the middle of this year having just reported the second quarter. But I think your assumption is right, Joe, and that is to say, we\u2019re having great success converting a pipeline into rooms under construction. We have more rooms under construction than anybody in the business and in every major region of the world, which I mentioned in my comments. Those rooms once they are under construction, obviously will highly likely to deliver. It\u2019s very unusual once under construction that they would not deliver.","So I think we still believe that last year was really the Nadir. We had a big pick up from last year this year sort of mid-4s to 6% or at the midpoint of our range in terms of net unit growth. And while I don\u2019t have the exact number because this year is still playing out in terms of rooms we will get under construction, but it\u2019s certainly our belief that that will continue to accelerate.","Joe Greff - JPMorgan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank","Thank you and good morning. Just if I could ask a question on the owned hotel segment, obviously you guys will start to lap some easier occupancy and we have already been seeing rate contributing north of 60% of the RevPAR core growth in that segment. Obviously saw margins pick up a little bit within this segment this quarter, but how do you guys foresee the cadence through the back half of the year of margin acceleration within that segment specifically?","Chris Nassetta","I think if you look at the guidance for the full year which I think is as good as anything out there, we\u2019re at a 150 basis points. We had a very strong margin growth in the first quarter because we were lapping some easier comps, but also we still had some of our ops effectiveness things rolling out. In this quarter, we were sort of on the higher end of the target of the range for the year.","So by definition, we\u2019re going to see margin growth more in line with the overall expectations for the year through the rest of the year. That\u2019s not because anything is going wrong, it\u2019s just that comps get harder as it relates to certain initiatives that we had going on in the hotel. So in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve had outsized margin growth because we had some opportunities to do things quite efficiently that build a much stronger base to leverage off of in terms of our cost structure and now we're getting very healthy margin growth, I think industry-leading margin growth, but we will tamper into that this year into that 100 to 150 basis point range.","So we feel very good about what's going on in the cost and the margin side as well as overall performance on the topline for the rest of the year. The big hotels have a -- will have an uptick from the second quarter in the second half of the year driven by group position, which is quite strong as I said. In the big hotels, group position in the third and fourth quarters in the high single-digits, low double-digits.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you, Chris. And if I could just ask one follow-up. As you guys obviously think about your balance sheet and positioning of your balance sheet and think about the cash flow, obviously that you will be generating for debt paydown and obviously assuming an EBITDA growth next year on top of this year\u2019s guidance, it looks if you will be somewhere in the mid-to-low 3 times leverage range by year end, next year. So I guess the question more or less is how do you think about your capital return strategy at that point in time? I know investment grade is the primary focus, but where do you feel you need to be to be comfortable there before you start kind of pursuing other measures of the capital returns?","Chris Nassetta","Great question. I that your math is directionally right, we are going to end this year based on the guidance we\u2019ve given in the low-4s. If you fast forward and make some assumptions, you\u2019re in the zone of being 3 to 4, which is our target. Our target is to get to a range where we can be a low grade, investment grade rating. And we do believe it\u2019s in that range. Obviously the rating agencies will have a lot to say about that, but that\u2019s based on a lot of work that we did as part of getting our initial ratings.","And once we get to that sort of level of lower grade, investment grade our belief remains that we\u2019re not in the business of hoarding capital. We are perfectly comfortable at that level of leverage that we have a balance sheet that is bulletproof and can deal with anything that might come at it. And so we would be very much looking at that point to take our free cash flow and give it back to shareholders.","And the way we would do that, I would say at first we would probably to make sure that we can appeal to yield investors to have some dividend that would likely sink up with where our competitive set is and then whatever remaining cash flow is available after that. It would be very simple we would give it back to shareholders in the way we think that they wanted back and that would either be through buybacks or dividends. And I think we would make that judgment based on what our view is at the time that shareholders are looking for.","We would be looking at the owners of the company. If we have excess cash flow, we think are entitled to get that cash back to way that they wanted. And as we I think have proven, we are able to perform at the top end of the industry both from a operating point of view, but also from a unit growth point of view without the need for a lot of capital. So we don\u2019t see that changing. We do think that once we get through the deleveraging that we will have a significant amount of free cash flow to be able to return to investors.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Thanks and good morning.","Chris Nassetta","Hey, Harry.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Good morning. I had a broader question and then a more narrow question. The broader one is that, Chris, you\u2019ve seen a number of lodging cycles. And as you look into 2015, what if anything versus say 2013 and into the first half of 2014, what if anything has changed that that you know that will continue to drive occupancy pricing margins forward? Are you more encouraged by any one or two factors?","Chris Nassetta","I think Harry the answer would be exactly what you and most everybody on the phone would expect. I think we are getting -- I do believe we\u2019re sort of right at the mid cycle. We have very strong real-time indications that the things that you would typically experience at this part of the cycle are occurring. You're getting back to very high occupancy levels. You have an ability because of the return of group business to really start to get more aggressive on your mix of business and because of the overall strength in the transient business and return of group business, you're able to move rates up in an absolute sense.","So I think 2015 is going to be another very, very good year simply because you\u2019ve got a lot more business coming in the funnel to manage. You are going to get -- we are going to be able to be much more aggressive on mix. We are going to be able to be more aggressive on moving rates up and all of that\u2019s going to be good for topline and all of that should flow through the bottom line should create a higher flow through situation.","So we\u2019re sitting here as we look to the rest of the year. Of course, as I already described feeling quite good and it\u2019s too early to give guidance, so I am not going to do that, but the setup for next year feels terrific really, really strong.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Very good. And then my follow-up question was on the Hilton brand, which from the topline perspective did lag the other brands. And just thought it would be useful to have you discuss what those -- what the factors maybe behind that, and is that an opportunity for you?","Chris Nassetta","I don't -- I mean having looked at it pretty carefully, I think the simple answer is just geography, specific geography of the brand. You can take out -- if we play around with it, take at sort of adjust for a few geographies and it\u2019s right in mind with everybody else. And there we don\u2019t believe there is any issue with it. I think you will see as those geographies sort of stabilize, you will see the Hilton brand back where it should be.","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah, Harry, the systemwide, that\u2019s our revenue weighted, right. So the bigger hotels in a couple of the markets as I mentioned in my comments that had just softer citywide those drive more because they are bigger revenue hotels.","Chris Nassetta","Chicago in the quarter, those have a huge impact because they are really big hotels.","Kevin Jacobs","And we have some big hotels with a fair amount of revenue in the Middle East.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah, Egypt, Saudi Arabia\u2026","Kevin Jacobs","And that\u2019s all historically because of the way business grew in those parts of world more Hilton.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Great. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks guys.","Chris Nassetta","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Could you just talk a little bit about your real estate value maximization programs? Are some of the ideas you\u2019ve talked about in the past, Hilton New York, in particular, and the Waldorf. I know, Hilton New York, you\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress. Any commentary on Waldorf or any of the others?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah, we're making good progress in the things that we've talked with you guys about in the last couple of quarters. So we broke ground or I should say our partner Blackstone broke ground at the Hilton Hawaiian Village to start our newest timeshare tower. We\u2019re in registration. We believe it will be actually selling units by the end of the year.","So we\u2019re often running and everything is progressing as planned at the Hilton New York. Terrific progress -- the design work for the retail platform. I think we\u2019re in good shape to get that under construction early next year and get that in process in delivering EBITDA in the year next year because it can be done relatively quickly.","On the timeshare at the New York Hilton again, quite good progress. We\u2019re in for registration at the moment and believe we will obtain that registration by year end. We haven\u2019t talked about it but we are way down the road in the process of getting incremental entitlement at the Hilton Waikoloa Village to do incremental timeshare in one or more of the towers.","We do believe that long-term maximization of that asset, given it\u2019s a very large hotel in a market that does not have enough airlift for a very large hotel is to convert one or more towers overtime to timeshare. We had to go through an entitlement process. We\u2019re largely done with that. The reason we have not talked much about it is because we have other inventory that we\u2019re selling in at that market. So it\u2019s not going to occur in terms of getting into the conversion and sale. It will not occur in the short term because it doesn\u2019t make sense at this exact moment.","But over the intermediate term, over the next couple of years, we will move forward with that and we do believe there is a very significant value arbitrage on that. And then on the Waldorf, of course the big one, there is nothing new to report. We are making really good progress as we talked about last time. We have very good understanding of what the various uses to maximize the opportunity are.","We have a very good understanding of the tax structuring opportunities to make sure that whatever we\u2019re doing is maximizing the sort of after-tax value accretion benefits to shareholders. And we are now out officially, sort of, in a process. I\u2019m trying to find a counterparty to make this all happen. It is still our objective that as I said on the last couple of calls, we\u2019ll be able to weigh that all out in details by the end of the year and we\u2019re making -- we\u2019re making good progress against that.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks for the detail.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Chris, unlike your closest peers, you were able to grow RevPAR sequentially in the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, do you attribute that more to -- I mean, you talked about that in the highlights behind how you had quarter. But I mean, do you think that that is attributable more to geographic mix or RevPAR index gains?","Chris Nassetta","I think it\u2019s more to do with RevPAR index gains. We had gains as I said over a 100 bps for the small system. Every single brand gained share. We have a bunch of different initiatives going on, on the revenue management side that have been very helpful, particularly in the limited service space where we\u2019ve been deploying a whole new revenue management technology base.","So I do believe it as almost everything to do. I mean -- let me put it this way. If you compare our RevPAR against one of our primary competitors, we overlapped pretty much perfectly and our performance was significantly better than theirs. So I think it is not -- that in and of itself, I think suggest it has a lot more to do with market share gains and things that we\u2019re doing versus geography.","We are very much of the belief that I have been shy about saying is that we have something reasonably unique which is we have very large scale, very large geographic diversification, very significant changed scale diversification and that you have great brand strategies, you connect those dots with great commercial strategies. We believe that it is a very powerful thing in terms of driving customer loyalty because we can serve all of customers\u2019 need, no matter what they are wherever in world -- wherever they want to be in the world and they are able to stay loyal to us.","Now obviously you\u2019ve got a good brand, you\u2019ve got good strategies on the revenue side but the makeup of what we have properly managed, I think, really does allow us to drive great results and hopefully our job. And we plan to continue to drive increasing market share premiums.","By the way, those market share premiums then are the reasons why we can drive these huge pipeline numbers and rooms under construction and net unit growth because in the end, it\u2019s all third-party capital. We\u2019re not buying rooms. We\u2019re not investing any major money. It\u2019s third-party money that\u2019s investing with us and investing with us because they're looking at these market share premiums. I'm describing and they're making the judgment that they are going to make more money by working with us than their other options.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","It\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then just talk about your pipeline for a second, in light of your Curio and then the newest accessible lifestyle brand. Is there any way to help us think through when we look at your pipeline growth for 2016, how much of a driver those two new brands could be?","Chris Nassetta","Not yet. I mean, we try to give you a sense of what you know, obviously we\u2019ve done in Curio to date and how many deals we have in motion. Curio is going to take off, I think, at a pretty good clip. Our lifestyle brand, their gestation period will be a little longer just because the -- it will be a little bit heavier proportion of new build and major renovation versus Curio which is almost immediate conversion opportunity of great independent hotels. So that will take a little bit longer.","What I would -- we\u2019re not giving guidance obviously. We talked about net unit growth. The way I think it all sort of boils down to expectations on -- what -- how many rooms are we going to deliver on an net basis into the system over time. As I said, we\u2019ll give you in the next -- sometime before the year is out obviously a little bit more visibility in the next year when we haven't. But I do believe as I said I think to Joe\u2019s question that last year was the natter and that net unit growth is going to continue to pick up and part of that pickup is going to be contributions from Curio in our lifestyle brand.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Okay. Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird. Your line is open.","David Loeb - Baird","Hi. Chris, first thanks for the very clear explanation of capital allocation strategy, that\u2019s helpful. To follow-up on Curio in the lifestyle brand, can you talk a little bit about your willingness to commit capital and how much capital you think you might need in order to jumpstart those two brands?","Chris Nassetta","I think the answer is very simple, David and good question, limited de minimis amounts of capital. We don't view those brands as any different than any of the others in the sense that we will occasionally on a strategic deal make a minor contribution most typically, almost exclusively in the form of key money. We would look at those two brands, particularly as they get started in that same way.","But I think when you look at the aggregate of what that means to take de minimis amount of capital. If you look at our entire pipeline, less than 5% by number of deals have had any contribution of key money. So that means more than 95% of the number of deals that we\u2019re doing are what we would call dry deals. There's no investment from us.","We think of these two brands as sort of a similar phenomena. We believe with the strength that I described of the overall system in our commercial engines that we have a lot to offer to owners and that we should not have to deploy our balance sheet to make these things happen in any material way.","David Loeb - Baird","So just a follow-up on that, would you consider lower franchise fees as an incentive for Curio in particular. Have you done some of that already?","Chris Nassetta","Well, I think all of us in the business on strategic deals will look at ramp-ups on franchises and things. And so yeah we would look at those particularly as new brands in that same way. But that\u2019s pretty typical in the business and that\u2019s very short-lived generally. I mean, it\u2019s not long-term discounts. It\u2019s basically sort of as hotels are coming into the system giving -- new or conversion giving them a chance to sort of ramp up.","So we would consider that in some cases. Again we view that as an investment just like key money. So if we\u2019re going to discount fees, we look at it relative to do we need to do it as a strategic deal on all of the same things we look at when we invest key money. One way or another, that\u2019s an investment as well. And so on occasion, we will do that. Just as everybody has and just as we\u2019ve done with other brands.","David Loeb - Baird","Great. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.","Robin Farley - UBS","Great. Thanks. I have one question and one follow-up. I guess, in the cycle, where would you say you start to get interested in monetizing real estate in the form of a potential REIT spinoff if we\u2019re halfway through the cycle now or in the second half of the cycle, is this where you start to think about timing for that?\\","And then my follow-up was really just clarifying, it sounded like in your opening remarks, that maybe there was slight lowering of guidance in the Asia-Pacific region. I think you said mid single-digit. That sounded like you were saying that through your full-year guidance for Asia-Pacific, which is just a tad low, I guess, in sort of, saying it would be the fastest growing RevPAR globally for you, which would have suggest kind of 7% or higher. So just want to clarify if that\u2019s what the subtlety in guidance? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Sure, sure. Both good questions. On the real estate side, I believe that it came up on the last call as well. I think the way that we look at that is less to do with exactly where we are in the cycle and more to do with, just wanting to make sure whatever we do at the real estate that it\u2019s a value creation exercise. As it relates to the bulk of our real estate given the tax attribute, the way that we would want to do any transaction is really to do in a tax efficient way.","And that it would mean in the structured transaction either for all our large parts of it. And for us to do that factoring for the cost of doing it, the cost of duplicative G&A and those things, what we really would need to see is some diversions in multiple that would suggest that a bifurcation of the business in that way would create value.","The reason we have not been rushing to do it is we have not seen those conditions. And so doing it now, we think would be treading water at best. Probably going underwater slightly because there are costs of doing it as they say and cost of duplicative G&A. So I think what we would be looking for has less to do with exactly where we are on the cycle, since we wouldn't really be taking these major assets and selling them out right because the friction in that would be too great.","We look at more -- at any point in time, wherever we are in the cycle to relative valuations and multiple suggest that the separation of the business would -- that parts separated would be worth more than the pieces together. And at least the way, we look at it today, we just don\u2019t see that. The APAC question is a great question and probably, we\u2019re trying to be settled.","We did probably bring the guidance down just a smidgen and had really to do with some of the things Kevin did reference relative to Thailand and Singapore being a little bit lighter. The core areas that drive our Asia-Pac business, which are Japan and China, we still feel good about that we\u2019re going to have a great year in Japan, very high rep progress.","And China, we still think we\u2019re in the six to seven ranges is what we thought. But just because of some disruption that you\u2019re seeing in Thailand and Singapore, being a little weaker, it is weighted the full year down a little bit to sort of mid or little bit better single-digit.","Robin Farley - UBS","Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Good morning, guys. Chris, back on, I think Steve questioned about the Waldorf. Have you reached a point or you can say it is more or less likely that you\u2019ll execute a transaction where you can pull cash out of the Waldorf versus finding a partner to recapitalized the development or redevelopment?","And second, can you maybe discuss what your priorities are there? I mean, I know you like to end up with the flagship hotel on a smaller footprint but are there other priorities such as cash or carried equity interest or even the timeshare of any that you put important are?","Chris Nassetta","I think, the priority starting maybe with the second and coming back to the first, both good question. I think, the priority for us in the end is to have a fully renovated reposition product on the full city block on Park Avenue that Waldorf Astoria represents.","And as part of that a very high quality five Star minimum, I would say plus or minus 400 room Waldorf Astoria, that would be the flagship for the Waldorf Astoria brand. Now there are lot of different ways to look at the uses where that hotel could be bigger than that. There are many, I think that it could be smaller. ","A lot of it has to do with honestly what various counterparties might want. From our point of view, if we end up with Waldorf at its size today, we can obviously, that would be very pleasing. We could have a smaller hotel and be quite satisfied with that. Getting timeshare use into it is an option. It is not necessarily a priority in terms of something that we have that done.","We would love to get cash out of Waldorf. I think the more likely efficient way of maximizing the value of the Waldorf is not going to involve getting a lot of cash out. I think its going to be trying to get a great value for the Waldorf, get the capital put in by third-party.","And in some way either doing it a joint venture where we continue to have an ownership, maybe a major ownership stake in the hotel or using in some way the proceeds of that to trade in the other real estate on an efficient basis.","We have not gotten to the bottom of all that because we\u2019re out in the world of counterparty, trying to figure out how third parties are going to look at it. But the reason that that is not highly likely that there is huge amount of cash to come out of it, isn\u2019t that there is not a huge manner value, there is.","I\u2019m not going to give you, because I don\u2019t know it yet but its worth a lot more than what the multiple time EBITDA is. It\u2019s that we want to do that on a very tax efficient basis. And I think you as the shareholder base should want us to do that as well, because there will be a lot of friction in the Waldorf. It was acquired in I think 1949, so you going to imagine it does not have a significant amount of basis.","The good news is, it has a huge amount of value and there are some very efficient ways in the world of real estate to be able to capture that value and effectively take advantage of that without ultimately having on a friction.","Exactly how we\u2019re going to do that. I'm not being quite. We don't know. We know the various options, which prototypical would sort to be either JV structure or a 1031 structure. We just have to sort of finish the process on the counterparty side to be able to judge, which direction it\u2019s going to go.","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Evercore. Your line is open.","Smedes Rose - Evercore","Thanks. I just wanted to go back to your big eight hotels, could you just maybe remind us kind of where they were in the last peak in terms of the percentage of group mix and where they are now? And kind of I know you don't want to talk about 2015 too much, but, I mean, is it fair to assume that the group will continue to strengthen there into next year, is that what you\u2019re seeing on pace now or maybe just a little more color around that?","Kevin Jacobs","","Yeah. Smedes, in terms of where they are versus the last cycle, they are actually about where they were before, but that doesn't mean we don't think that we can layer groups in more effectively as group demand strengthens to increase it. So I think we\u2019ve said publicly in the past that the target there is sort of 40% and they are in the high 30s. So if we are successful as demand strengthens in the top of the funnel fills and layering groups into non-peak periods, we ought to be able to continue to drive it a little bit higher.","Chris Nassetta","And I think just and it\u2019s implied in what Kevin said, this quality of group is also taking the groups that are lower rated, lower quality groups and lower -- importantly lower spend groups that were sort of filler in a more challenging group environment and replacing them with higher quality, higher paying groups that spend more and have a lot more ancillary spend. So there is plenty of upside in sort of the transition of group going forward.","Smedes Rose - Evercore","All right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Hey, guys, good morning. So there is some hope that incentive management fee is close to inflection point here. Your IMF increased 15% this quarter, 17% last quarter. How should we think about the trajectory going forward? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","I think the trajectory sort of what we saw in the quarter is sort of the full year trajectory, probably would have been a little bit closer to the first quarter trajectory. But for what's going on in the Middle East, we have a handful of incentive management fee contracts that are pretty lucrative there and in Middle East we\u2019ve got a few issues as you can read going on. So it weighted it down a little bit. But we feel great about that trajectory.","I mean, notably if you look at our IMF, which I think is a little bit different, 80% of our overall IMF is outside the U. S., only 20% is inside the U.S. And why does that matter? It matters because the structure of incentive management fees outside the U.S. is different. It\u2019s a much lower rate of structure. We don't sit behind a press the owners like sort of traditional approach inside the U.S.","So, you\u2019re going to continue to see a good -- I think this year is going to be fine sort of in the mid-teams or maybe inching up a little past that. But as we get into the next couple years, both because of improvement in performance, but importantly because the majority of the pipeline is international. Majority of those have incentive management fees because there are full service and they have these incentive management fees that don\u2019t sit behind priorities.","At those continues to enter the system, you\u2019re going to see incentive management fee growth going to the 20-plus percent range over the next couple years. So we feel good about this year trajectory, feel very good about.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. And this is my follow-up. As you gave some good detail on the Waldorf, I think I\u2019ll just try and push it a little more. Do you know the approximate square footage of the room base? Just trying to think if you were to lower the room count from 1,413 now to 400 to 500, how much saleable square feet would there be for other stuff? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. Thomas, it\u2019s a 1.6 million square foot building, so it really can vary quite a bit depending on how counterparty would want to break it up between residential and hotel. So the overall square footage is about 1.6 million.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Nassetta, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.","Chris Nassetta","Great. Thanks, everybody. We appreciate the time here on a Friday in the middle of summer. We\u2019ll try and find a better day, but as a new public company, Friday seemed to be the only day that we could get. We are going to do a little bit next year. Anyway, we\u2019re very pleased as I think you could tell with both the second quarter results, but more importantly, how we feel about the second half of next year and how we feel about the broader setup going in the next year. We will look forward to catch it up with you after third quarter and I hope everybody enjoys the rest of your summer.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

My name is Matthew and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hilton Worldwide Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Christian Charnaux, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Christian Charnaux","Thank you, Matthew. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings call. Before we begin we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.","The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com.","This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our year-end results and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2014; Kevin Jacobs, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions.","With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks, Christian, and thank you all for joining us today. We are certainly very excited to be back in the public markets and to be hosting our first earnings call, following our IPO in December. We are also very pleased with our performance for last year, highlighted by our system-wide RevPAR growth of 5.2%, and our full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.21 billion, which is a 13% increase year-over-year.","I'm sure many of you have heard some version of our story on our various road shows. But for those that have not and at the risk of making this call little longer than normal, I thought I briefly highlight our investment pieces before getting into our 2013 performance and our outlook for 2014.","When I joined the company in 2007, at the time of the Blackstone acquisition we were presented with once in a lifetime opportunity to take a nearly 100 year old company that had once been a clear leader in this space but had become complacent and return that company to a leadership position. Many of the pieces were there, including a portfolio of distinct brand, spending all the major customer segments, and strong commercial engines that were delivering good results for owners, but we were an average performer at that on the top-line margins, bottom-line and met unit growth. As an enterprise we certainly were not optimized or aligned strategically.","So the first thing we did was to get intense alignment of our organization around a common vision, mission, values, and set up key strategic priorities. Well our work in this regard will never be done we have successfully transformed our business into what is now a lean and unified organization over the performance driven culture. This has enabled the new Hilton Worldwide to outperform our competition, while executing a transformation during one of the worst economic downturns in history. I also believe that our transformation has set us up extremely well to continue to outperform in the future.","We are in a business where scale and global diversification matter. And today we're a global business with over 4100 properties and 678,000 rooms in 91 countries and territories. We have 10 distinct brands and scaled commercial engines that drive an industry leading global RevPAR index premium of 15%. Tying it altogether is our award winning Hilton Honors Loyalty Program with 40 million members that today makeup more than 50% of total system-wide occupancy.","Our goal is simple. To serve any customer, anywhere in the world through any lodging need they have. By doing so we drive more customer loyalty, higher market share premiums, better returns for our hotel owners, and that in turn drives faster net unit growth, and ultimately premium returns for our shareholders.","By intelligently deploying our brands to different regions around the world and optimizing those brands for local markets, we believe we can continue to grow in all regions and under all macroeconomic condition.","Our development strategy, which I'll get into in a little bit more detail in a few minutes, is based on our goal to win everywhere. We want to be number one in both pipeline and rooms under construction in every region of the world. Today not only do we have the industry's largest pipeline, but we are also number one in rooms under construction in every major region of the world according to Smith Travel Research.","More importantly, our global strategy, growth strategy is built around our capital light management and franchise segment and we've been extremely disciplined with our capital allocation. In this segment, we have added roughly 180,000 net rooms to the system since 2007, which has lead the industry with 37% growth over that time, with an investment of only $47 million. Our pipeline has also been built with the minimus amounts of capital. We believe that if we continue to maintain the strongest brands in the industry, we should not have to allocate significant capital to grow.","Our shareholders should also benefit from the embedded upside in our ownership segment which today represents 37% of our adjusted EBITDA. Our diverse portfolio includes iconic assets in some of those best global lodging markets such as New York, London, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, and Sydney. While we are not activating our real estate segment today in terms of meaningful new unit growth we are extremely active in maximizing what we do own.","We believe we can realize on the embedded value in our real estate in three ways. First, we are in the sweet spot of the cycle with group demand driving premium revenue growth in our big group boxes, which combine with our disciplined approach to managing cost, should allow us to continue to drive premium margin growth. This is evidenced in our nearly 300 basis point increase in ownership segment adjusted EBITDA margins in 2013.","Second, there are a number of significant value enhancement opportunities embedded in our portfolio. A great example of this is that our Hilton Hawaiian Village property, where we recently entered into a transaction to sell the land and entitlements we obtained over the past few years, which will create significant incremental value from what has been a non-income producing part of the reserve, actually a loading dock. Kevin will give you more detail on the transaction in his remarks and we will continue to keep you updated on additional real estate value enhancement opportunities on future calls.","Finally, the third way we could create incremental value from our real estate will be to further our migration to a capital light business model by divesting of some or all of the real estates over time. We are not emotionally tied to our real estate and while we intend to keep the vast majority of these properties in the system, there are ways to accomplish that without owning the hard assets. At the moment, we believe we can benefit from the upside on these assets operationally and from mining value enhancement opportunities, but if divesting of some or all of the real estate will enhance overall shareholder value in the future, we will actively consider those options.","Shifting gears in our timeshare business we have taken what has been an extremely successful business historically, with both sales growth and margins outperforming competition and transformed it to a much more capital light business. Today, our timeshare segment derives a significant and growing portion of its earnings from fees. In 2013, 54% of our interval sales were on behalf of the third-parties and 78% of our year-end inventory was capital light. We believe that by expanding a new capital light deal, combined with continuing to develop additional smaller phases of new developments on our own balance sheet, we can continue to grow our timeshare EBITDA at a steady pace with significantly less capital investments than has been spent historically.","The last part of our investment thesis is the positive fundamentals in the business, both short-term and long-term. On a macro basis, we believe our business currently stands at the intersection of three powerful global trends. Over the past 20 years growth in global tourism as measured by tourist arrivals has doubled, and is forecasted double again over the next 20 years. Driven by a middle class, it has continued to expand from 1 billion people globally 20 years ago to a projected 5 billion in the next 20.","Contrasting net dynamic is the fact that hotel rooms per capita in markets like China and Brazil remains at a small fraction of the level of developed markets like the United States. On a more micro basis, the supply\/demand environment of the business remained strong with healthy demand growth outpacing levels of supply growth that are still well below long-term averages. Combined, we believe these trends paid a picture of sustainable growth potential for our business. There will be ups and downs for sure over time but I believe the setup for the next several years and frankly for the long-term growth in our business is as good as I have ever seen.","So shifting to our performance. Our system-wide comp RevPAR growth was 5.2% for the full year 2013 on a currency neutral basis that was driven by a 3.3% increase in average rates and a 1.3 percentage point increase in occupancy.","Our hotels continue to benefit from strong fundamentals in 2013 with transient growth outpacing group, but it was group picking up momentum during the year. Group was particularly strong in our Big Box Hotel with group business at our Big 8 hotels up 10%, helping to drive Big 8 RevPAR growth of 9.2% for the year. Our owned and leased hotels in the U.S. also performed well growing RevPAR 6.8% for the year. On a system-wide basis we continue to grow our RevPAR index premium up nearly a 12 percentage point.","Our strong top-line performance combined with our disciplined approach to managing cost was a significant improvement operating margins in 2013. Our U.S. owned and leased hotels grew operating margins over 250 basis points and globally our owned and operated hotels grew operating margins over a 150 basis points on a currency neutral basis.","This operating margin performance in our hotels combined with our overall management and franchise growth of nearly 8%, strong growth in timeshare EBITDA of 18%, and continued corporate cost discipline led to strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Full year 2013 adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.21 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, and overall adjusted EBITDA margins increased over 300 basis points versus 2012.","Turning to development I thought I'd cover some highlights including what we're doing on our brands around the world. For starters, we approved a record 72,000 rooms for development in 2013 including over 37,000 rooms in the U.S. nearly 15,000 rooms in Asia-Pacific and nearly 10,000 rooms in Europe. And end of the year was an industry leading pipeline that includes over 1,100 hotels and 195,000 rooms.","Historically, our pipeline was heavily concentrated in the U.S. When we got to the company over 80% of the pipeline was located in the U.S. Today it is six years later 60% of our pipeline is outside the U.S. and we have very good balance among the region. We've had great success in the Asia-Pacific region growing our pipeline over 55,000 rooms and our Middle East Africa pipeline is the largest in the industry with over 20,000 rooms.","Europe is another great example of the success of our development strategy. In 2007 we knew the European market was likely to be value driven for years to come. By investing in our local commercial capabilities and leading with our conversion of family DoubleTree by Hilton brand and our value oriented Hampton and Hilton Garden Inn brands that we customized for the European markets. We went from three non-Hilton Conrad branded hotels in 2007 to over 200 either open or in the pipeline at the end of 2013. Today, we have nearly 30,000 rooms in our European pipeline and more than 16,000 rooms under construction, which is over as twice as many as our nearest competitor.","Pipelines are great but the first step in the process of converting a pipeline into fee paying rooms is getting shovels in the ground. Over half the rooms in our pipeline well over a 100,000 rooms are under construction, which is more than 21,000 rooms or 25% ahead of our closest competitor. Our share of rooms under construction globally of 18.6% outpaces our global share of room supply by over four times. And like our pipeline the geographic breakup of our rooms under construction has shifted dramatically. Today 77,000 or 76% of our rooms under construction are outside U.S. compared to just 13% in 2007, which has increased our rooms under construction outside the U.S. by 14 times during that period.","This shift in focus to a more geographically diverse development strategy has enabled us to grow significantly outside the U.S. We now have more than 50% more trading rooms outside the U.S. than we did in 2007. But to be clear we have not lost our focus on growth in the U.S. Our category leading focus service brands are in high demand from the development community and in an environment where most new hotel development is being done in those segments.","In our conversion friendly whole service brand led by DoubleTree by Hilton, have enabled us to win more than our fair share of those deals as well. Our approximately 25,000 rooms under construction in the U.S. as of year-end 2013, represents 24% of the total rooms under construction U.S. compared to our 11% share of existing U.S. supply.","We believe we're in a sweet spot for branded hotel development in the U.S. With fundamentals creating an appetite for hotel development and capital markets that are strong enough to support development, but with enough discipline remaining in the market to ensure that only quality projects with a strong experience of task to them are getting done. This dynamics is keeping overall supply growth in U.S well below long-term averages but allowing us to grow at a faster pace than our competitors.","The next step in converting a pipeline to fee paying rooms is of course actually opening hotels. In 2013, we opened 207 hotels with nearly 34,000 rooms. Conversions accounted for 35% of these openings largely in our DoubleTree by Hilton brand. After removals we had net unit growth of more than 25,000 rooms representing growth of over 4% for the year. It's important to note that we achieved this growth with the minimus amount of capital on investment and without any acquisitions.","Given our strong pipeline and our rooms currently under construction, we expect net unit growth to accelerate in 2014 and 2015 which I'll get into a little bit more detail in a couple of minutes.","We currently mentioned our DoubleTree brand a couple of times in the context of our growth strategy. DoubleTree is one of the great brand success stories during the time we've been at the company. It has become, I'd say somewhat quietly, the fastest growing upscale brand in the lodging business, having doubled in size since 2007, even while we removed nearly 10% of the brand to improve overall quality. Roughly 75% of the room additions have come from conversions of non-Hilton Worldwide brands. We accomplished this by updating the brand DNA to make it more relevant to our customers and by better connecting the brand to our commercial engines including honors. This better connectivity combined with the improvement in the quality of the brand's hotels and a refreshed brand identity including by Hilton in the name have created significant improvement in customer satisfaction and helped increase the overall RevPAR index of the brand by over 600 basis points since 2007.","This of course has led to increased owner profitability and presence for the brand, which has enabled it to drive a significant portion of our growth in North America and in Europe, where value conversion plays have been at a premium as well as accelerating its growth in emerging markets through new build.","Last year, we opened our 4000th hotel on the Hubei province of China. China continues to be a strong performing market for us with 6.7% comp currency neutral RevPAR growth in 2013. We now have 43 hotels operating in Greater China that's up from 6 in 2007 and a pipeline of more than 140 hotels with more than 46,000 rooms, the largest in the industry among the global brand.","Overall in Asia-Pacific, we've had a great success in growing our business having doubled the number of hotels in the region since 2007. And our pipeline of over 55,000 rooms in the region more than five times larger than it was in 2007. One of these pipeline hotels is the stunning Waldorf Astoria in Beijing, which opened last week. We continue to build tremendous momentum with the fastest growing luxury brands in the business.","Our luxury portfolio of Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels has more than doubled since 2007 to 47 properties, the 29 hotels in our pipeline will increase our luxury footprint by more than 40% and in some of the most desirable luxury markets in the world such as Jakarta, Bali, Hainan Island, Grand Cayman, Mumbai, Mecca, Suzhou, Doha, Bangkok, Jerusalem, Amsterdam and many more.","Turning to our flagship, Hilton Hotels & Resorts brand we have also had great success by focusing on simplifying the full service operating model particularly in the developed world. The goals to get customers more of what they want and they're willing to pay for and less of what they don't making the brand more relevant to get and more profitable for owners.","Hilton is the number one ranked hotel brand and global awareness and now has 554 hotels opened and the largest development pipeline in its 94-year history with a 150 projects in the pipeline, 95% of which are outside the U.S.","In our focused-service category, are more than 2,800 properties remain a formidable engine of growth, both domestically and increasingly internationally. For example, Hampton continues to expand with more than 350 hotels in its pipeline, including more than 160 open or in the pipeline outside the United States. The brand will open its 2000th hotel early in the second quarter and maintains an unmatched market share premium among midscale brands.","Home2 Suites by Hilton is another great example of our ability to innovate on the product side to better serve customers needs and enhance our growth rate. Home2 has opened 28 hotels since launching three years ago, with nearly a 100 hotels in the pipeline and its tremendous initial growth has been achieved entirely 100% with third-party capital.","Hilton Garden Inn has 581 existing hotels with 214 in its pipeline; more than 50% of the pipeline is located outside the United States. In fact, we recently opened our first Hilton Garden Inn in China introducing our fifth brand to the Chinese market. The response has been very positive and the brand has another 16 hotels in the pipeline in China. Adding Hilton Garden Inn and soon Embassy Suites in China is the result of our belief of having a full portfolio brand with hotels for every type of guest travel need will be as crucial in China as it is in the developed markets.","We firmly believe that our brand lineup is the significant strategic advantage and diverse enough to meet most customer needs in most regions but we are always looking to enhance our ability to serve customers globally. As you've heard from my comments, we continue to expand existing brands geographically and we will continue to explore new brand or brand extension opportunities to serve even more customers and owners in the future, which we look forward to discussing with you in future quarters.","Another aspect of staying ahead in our business and growing our industry leading market share premium is continuing to innovate. That innovation can come in the form of innovation in our brand portfolio as I described but it also needs to come from the ways we interact with our customers. Today's traveler wants an increasing level of both choice and control and we're taking advantage of our scale to design and implement solutions across our portfolio to given just that. We pioneered and launched e-check-in over five years ago and today our gold and diamond honors members can check-in online or on their mobile devices and also choose their preferred room at over 3,000 hotels.","In the not too distant future, we expect to announce significant enhancements and expansion of this service to make all our guests' journey even easier through their digital device. We all know that travels are increasingly mobile and the growth of our mobile bookings continues to explode. Mobile has experienced a more than eight fold increase in revenue since 2010 and has doubled just over the last 12 months. With mobile-enabled booking channels, particularly our enhanced HHonors and Hilton Apps that we launched last year and new apps hitting the market soon mobile certainly a key focus of our digital agenda.","We also continue to focus on driving conversion across all our direct digital channels. Millward Brown Digital for example reports almost having the industry leading conversion and booking share in U.S. Our goal is making our direct channels the preferred channel for our guests.","In 2013, we invested in expanding our digital languages and launched 22 language booking and in covering 79 countries.","Shifting gears back to performance. Let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2014. We anticipate system-wide RevPAR growth increase 5% to 7% for the full year obviously showing positive momentum versus 2013. We have a very positive outlook for group business with both rooms on the books and rates up meaningfully versus last year. Our 2014 group revenue position at our Big 8 hotels is up 10%, compared to the same time last year. And group business for the same period for our larger group of managed hotels in the U.S. is up 7%.","As we look at the macroeconomic picture and outlook for lodging performance around the world, we see generally improving conditions and continued optimism for 2014. In U.S. we expect modestly better GDP growth, which should drive modestly better demand growth, and we expect continued momentum in group bookings, especially with much of the government shutdown and debt ceiling noise behind us. We believe that this demand will be paired with needed supply growth leading to a modestly better RevPAR growth picture than last year.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we expect to see continued strong performance again in 2014. Japan was particularly strong as all our hotels delivered double-digit RevPAR growth in 2013. And so far, the outlook for '14 remains very strong as the Japanese government continues to inject liquidity into their markets. China GDP growth is expected to moderate a bit and we expect to see slightly lower RevPAR growth in 2014 of 5.5% to 6%, down from nearly 7% in 2013.","In Europe, we expect the improving economic climate experienced in 2013 to continue into '14 and we expect our RevPAR performance to continue to improve a bit as well.","London, where we have a very large presence in particular continues to pickup. In 2014 group revenue position in the region overall is up significantly a 20%. Overall, Europe RevPAR growth was relatively strong in 2013 with RevPAR growth of 3.9%, as expected to be up in the mid-single-digits in 2014.","The Middle East and Africa region is a tail of individual markets. Our Africa and Indian Ocean, Arabia, Arabian Peninsula, and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia markets have been and are expected to continue to be strong and of course, Egypt remains highly volatile.","For the full year 2014, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.365 billion to $2.435 billion. In terms of unit growth, we expect to have 35,000 units to 40,000 units to our managed and franchised segments, on a net basis which would represent 5.5% to 6.5% unit growth in that segment and does not assume any growth from acquisitions.","On an overall basis, we are optimistic that 2014 will be stronger than '13. There will undoubtedly be ebbs and flows within regions, but generally the macro trend seem to be similar or better than what we saw in 2013.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Jacobs for a little bit more detail on the fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our 2014 expectations.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris suggested, we are very pleased with our results for both the fourth quarter and full year, which exceeded our expectations. We were also thrilled with what we were able to accomplish last year in the capital markets, completing both our debt refinancing and of course our IPO. I will speak in more detail for the refinancing and IPO in a little bit and then we'll get into our 2014 outlook a bit more. But first let's talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results.","Adjusted for special items, EPS was $0.53 for the full year 2013, compared to $0.45 in the prior year, an increase of 18%. Prior to adjustments net income was $415 million for the full year 2013, compared to $352 million for 2012 or $0.45 per share and $0.38 per share respectively.","For the fourth quarter, adjusted for special items, EPS was $0.11 compared to $0.10 in 2012. Prior to adjustments net income was $26 million, compared to $61 million in 2012 or $0.03 per share and $0.07 per share respectively.","Special items that have been adjusted in both our fourth quarter and full year results include a one-time charge of $306 million associated with the conversion of our private company compensation plan for senior management into stock at the IPO, which was paid entirely out of Blackstone's ownership in the company and not dilutive to shareholders.","In the fourth quarter, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of our prior debt of approximately $230 million and the release of a tax valuation allowance of approximately $90 million net, as low as the GAAP tax benefit on all of those special items.","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $603 million, an increase of 16% over 2012 results. Full year 2013 adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.21 billion, a 13% increase over 2012. System-wide comparable RevPAR increased 4.7% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year on a currency neutral basis.","Our growth rate for the quarter was a bit lower than we saw in the previous three quarters, which was largely driven by a decrease in government business resulting from the government shutdown.","During the quarter our brands continued to gain overall market share and we also ended the year with a strong December recording RevPAR growth of over 6%.","In terms of our regional performance, in the United States for the year continued economic recovery drove comparable system-wide RevPAR growth of over 5% and comparable U.S. owned and operated hotels were up over 6%. San Francisco and Hawaii remained strong markets for us with comparable RevPAR in those markets up 13% and 12% respectively. The New York market was a bit softer as difficult year-over-year comparisons and the continued absorption of new supply led to RevPAR growth of the market of just 3.5% for the year on a comparable system-wide basis. Our owned hotels in New York were a bit stronger with RevPAR growth of nearly 4%.","In Europe, strong performance in the UK and Ireland, particularly in London, as well as key markets in Continental Europe led to comparable currency neutral RevPAR growth for the full year of 3.9% primarily driven by occupancy. Germany, Amsterdam, and Turkey were also strong performing markets for us in the quarter.","In the Middle East and Africa region comparable currency neutral RevPAR grew 6.4% for the year, even with continued political unrest in Egypt, somewhat hurting our overall results for the region. We saw strength in the Arabian Peninsula, even with a drag from Saudi visa restrictions and the African Indian Ocean market was strong despite softness in Nairobi due to the terrorist attack that happened there in the third quarter.","In the Asia-Pacific region we continued to outperform with strong demand in Japan and China driving comparable currency neutral RevPAR growth of 7% for the full year.","Next I'd like to take you through some highlights of our segment results. Total management and franchise fees were $333 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2012. For full year 2013, total management and franchise fees were $1.27 billion, an increase of roughly 8% over the full year of 2012.","In our ownership segment, adjusted EBIDTA for the fourth quarter of 2013 of $254 million was roughly 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by strong RevPAR growth of 5.1% in the U.S. and operating margin growth at our U.S. owned and leased hotels of over 180 basis points.","For full year 2013, adjusted EBIDTA for the ownership segment increased 17% to $926 million, again driven by strong comparable RevPAR growth in the U.S. of 6.1% and cost discipline at our U.S. owned and leased hotels where operating margins increased over 250 basis points.","In the timeshare segment, 2013 adjusted EBIDTA of $297 million was 18% better than the prior year.","As Chris mentioned earlier we recently executed a purchase and sale agreement with a Blackstone led partnership with third-party capital investors for the sale of certain land and entitlement rights at our Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort in connection with the planned timeshare development project to be called the Grand Islander. This transaction is great example of the tremendous momentum we have in moving our timeshare business through a capital light model and the attraction we've gained in the institutional investor community around the tracking product capital for development.","It's also the first step of many and I'm unlocking the embedded value in our real estate portfolio as we expect to generate about $375 million of overall EBIDTA and roughly $180 million of incremental net present value out of what has been historically a non-income producing part of the resort.","We expect to commence sales of the timeshare units of the property in the fourth quarter of 2014, and for construction to be completed in late 2016. We will keep you updated on our progress on this exciting project.","Turning to our balance sheet, in addition to the $1.24 billion of net proceeds from the IPO, we closed on the complete refinancing of our prior acquisitions got in multiple markets during the fourth quarter, creating a balance sheet that we believe is a tremendous asset for the company and will provide us with an incredible amount of financial possibility for the future.","Prior to the IPO, we refinanced a vast majority of our long-term debt through multiple transactions raising $13.1 billion of new debt along with a $1 billion under our revolver. These proceeds along with available cash were used to repay approximately $13.5 billion of debt outstanding, which was the remaining dollars of the loan originated to acquire the company in 2007.","The principal components for the refinancing included a $7.6 billion floating rate, 7-year term loan facility and $1.5 billion of unsecured 5.625% senior notes due 2021, as well as a $3.5 billion 5-year commercial mortgage backed securities loans secured by 23 of our U.S. owned hotels and a $525 million mortgage secured by the Waldorf Astoria in New York.","We also entered into interest rates swaps on a total of $1.4 billion of the term debt, which set our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt at 50:50. Additionally we put in place approximately $700 million of financing against our timeshare receivables in the form of a $450 million conduit and $250 million of asset backed securities, all of which are non-recourse for the company.","Subsequent to this refinancing we made $1.6 billion of voluntary prepayments on the term loan, including $360 million from available cash and the $1.24 billion of net IPO proceeds. As a result the outstanding dollars of the term loan facility at year-end was $6 billion. Additionally subject to the provisions in the loan agreement the margin on the floating portion of this term loan was stepped down by 25 basis points in accordance with the IPO and is now set at 275 basis points.","As of year-end we had net debt of $11.5 billion at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.2%, and a weighted average maturity of 6.2 years. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $860 million, including $266 million of restricted cash and we had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolver.","Finally, let's turn to our outlook for 2014. For the full year, as Chris mentioned, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis with 60% to 70% of that being driven by rate. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on the same basis.","We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of between $2.365 billion and $2.435 billion. Management and franchise fees are expected to increase between 10% and 12%. In timeshare we expect segment adjusted EBITDA to be between $310 million and $325 million.","We expect CapEx spending, excluding timeshare inventory, to total approximately $350 million, including about $250 million to $260 million in hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. We expect corporate and other segment expense to increase between 3% and 5% including incremental public company cost. We expect diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $0.57 and $0.61 for the full year.","For the first quarter of 2014 we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency neutral basis. In the U.S. and UK we expect the weather we have experienced so far this year to marginally affect Q1 RevPAR growth. However this should be somewhat offset by the lapping of the beginning of the U.S. government sequester during the first quarter of 2013.","We expect adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of between $480 million and $500, which include a one-time benefit of approximately $25 million from the reversals and the accrual related to the conversion of our prior cash based long-term incentive compensation plan into a restricted stock plan for our Vice Presidents and below. That benefit will reverse itself by year-end in the form of share based compensation expense.","Further detail on our fourth quarter and full year guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning.","This concludes our prepared remarks and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have. Matthew, back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan.","Chris Nassetta","Hi, Joe.","Joe Greff - JP Morgan","Welcome back. Looking at your 2014 EBITDA guidance and other outlook components how does that translate into free cash flow multiple debt reduction for the year? In other words, it is what other non-cash add-backs or the working capital items are there to drive your free cash beside the simplistic method EBITDA less interest less taxes less CapEx?","Chris Nassetta","I think that gets you pretty close to the right number. I mean I'd say that based on the sort of range of outcomes, it's about $700 million to $900 million, roughly that should be available for debt reduction in the year.","Joe Greff - JP Morgan","And then the upfront cash that you get from monetizing the land and your rights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village how much is that I know Kevin you mentioned what's the net present value of that?","Kevin Jacobs","The land sale component of it is $25.4 million and then the rest of the MPV is in the sales and marketing and operating agreements that we're entering into.","Joe Greff - JP Morgan","Chris, earlier you painted a generally optimistic picture for net unit growth. Can you just talk about the mood in the hotel development community specifically in China right now I guess what markets are there with positive momentum and for what demand, how does China generally feel?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I mean -- I'd say still not withstanding the GDP growth is moderating a little bit and they -- and China is clearly been trying to make sure that they don't end up with a real estate bubble. It's clearly still generally pretty positive. There was a period of time I would say sort of in the first half of last year where China development really slowed down. It picked up pretty materially, it didn't get back to the peak levels but it picked up pretty materially in the second half of last year, and what we see so far in China in the beginning of this year and we said in our Investment Committee Meeting in the last couple of weeks where we review all the deals we're doing. It feels -- it still feels pretty good.","It is changing and so my comments about Hilton Garden Inn and my prepared comments and what we're doing with the launch of Embassy which will occur later in the year would put in those -- would put my comments for a reason and that is definitely to signal that there is change of thought I think. There's no question that full service and luxury we still have pretty good momentum in China, but the pace at which this new development is getting done I think in the market generally at the high end of the business as close somewhat and I think it's picking up in the midscale segment of the business. So we've been very, very focused on Garden Inn. We think Embassy has adapted for that market as a great sort of value play in the full service space that's going to play well.","We haven't done it yet, but we haven't launched it yet, but we've been working on our Hampton launch in the China market. We've done all sort of the background work and research and development work for how we would adapt that product for the market. So I think you're going to look to see that over the next couple of quarters that we will be doing something and what I would describe is sort of the 3.5 star space in China. So I'm -- listen, long-term I'm very optimistic about the development opportunities in China. In the short to intermediate term I'm pretty damn optimistic as well, I just think that the makeup of it is increasingly going to be more in the midmarket and less at the upper end of the market.","We're very focused on, as I said, we think it's really important not just for building our business in China, which is important to serve the billion plus people in China, but China is very rapidly becoming the number one outbound market in the world in the next couple of years will have 100 million outbound travelers and we want to have a very sort of like we do in developed parts of the world Europe and U.S., very broad distribution at all the important price points so that we build mass sort of loyalty to our family brand, both to build our business in China, but as increasingly Chinese travelers leave the market they're going to -- we think they're going to stay with the brands when they're in other parts of the world that they become loyal to in their home market.","So we're focused on that and I think the most important way that that's going to happen meaning broad distribution within China is going to happen in the three-and-a-half to four star space not in the five plus star space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Yes, very good. I wanted to just focus on the U.S. for a minute. In the U.S., in 2013 you ended -- your occupancy ended at about 73% and you talked about group business in '14 being pretty strong. You really needed that this level of occupancy, what are your occupancy growth expectations for this year? And then the second part of the question is recently what have you been seeing in, in the quarter for the quarter group demand has that been much of a help or a headwind?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, on the occupancy side listen it's a tail of mortgage and assets. So I think as you look at it 73% might -- we're going to have as Kevin suggested, we would probably have our RevPAR growth, you're going to have somewhere between half a point and a point of occupancy growth. You're certainly getting to the point where you don't need a lot more occupancy broadly in the system and my guess is that 60% to 70% rate growth figure that we get will be even higher next year.","So I think we're getting from a cycle point of view to the point where as you're implying in your question, we want to be and we certain -- don't get me wrong, we're certainly focused on rates and we will be increasingly focused on rates, but there will be a little bit more broad sort of system-wide U.S. occupancy gain this year.","Well that's basically come on the group side, if you look at on average 73% it's great but if you look at it sort of by individual segments particularly looking at the big group hotels, big commercial hotels they still have occupancy to go, because we are mid cycle in my opinion in terms of where we are broadly that is generally when you see the group business come back that's when you see these big hotels really start to perform as a result of building that, that that be.","And I would say from the standpoint of the real big boxes and bigger markets unlike may be sort of the limited service in suburban secondary markets, there is more occupancy there. So you're not going to see a whole lot of occupancy and a lot of markets moving, but you're going to see it disproportionally moving in the bigger market and in these big very large hotels, if that answer the question.","In terms of I would say that group position I gave you in my comments very strong up year-over-year, the way I would describe pace, which means a different timeframe sort of what we are doing in different periods of time booking on a year-over-year basis. You probably wouldn't be surprised that in the fourth quarter we saw some pace declines and that was we can pretty much track if that was the result of a lot of what was going on with the U.S. Government and the government shutdown and the potential throughout of debt ceiling issues and budget debate that had not been solved, and every time that flares up, we've pretty consistently seen people that are making longer lead decisions and that's what's going on with group, start to freeze up. So we had very healthy pace. I would say in the first quarter through third quarter overall, fourth quarter, not as much we think a direct sort of results for that.","And the good news is in terms of what we see thus far this year, we've seen that stabilize and start to pickup. So pace is positive and what we see right now and obviously the position is positive. Now, that we are pretty -- we think certain I mean if not entirely certain that you're not going to have any -- if the budget discussion is done, looks like that everybody has agreed to a increase in the debt ceiling that gets us to the second quarter of next year.","At this point, we think that portends very good things for the group business. We think that the business is there, the demand there and without -- this is technical term without the Psychobabble that has been going on in Washington, we think there is a -- that the business will continue to pickup. We obviously saw a great -- I said we were up 10% group in our Big 8 last year; we were up 10% again this year in terms of position. The Big 8 had great RevPAR growth last year. We expect to have a very good RevPAR growth, higher than the high-end of our guidance driven by these factors, which is building both occupancy but also rate in the group side and providing that strong foundation for us to continue to squeeze out lower price transient business and only take the best transient business.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","And then, just a very quick follow-up on your incentive management fees. There seems to be some headwinds in 2013, the IMS were pretty flat. What are your expectations for '14; it should be a tailwind in '14?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I think listen what's going on in '13 is just some year-over-year comp issues at the -- we had some contracts that were sort of changed and one in particular, a very big one in Mecca that distorted what was going on with incentive management fees. It obviously -- it's a very positive thing for the company. We restructured an existing agreement and changed the incentive management fee arrangements and returned for I think 4500 new rooms that were doing with this developer in Mecca over the next -- that will be opening over the next three or four years, so a very positive thing, but it distorted the IMS.","This year, IMS growth was going to be sort of in the 8% to 10% range. I'd say that's sort of the beginning of a very nice trajectory in the sense that if we look at what we have under construction around the world a 102,000 room, 75%, 80% of those are international the vast majority of those are sort of in the full service and luxury space, almost every one of those have incentive management fee contracts. For the record they don't stand behind on our priorities, those are the really good kind. And as we deliver those hotels into the system -- and obviously they are under construction, so that will be happening fairly rapidly, you will start to see a very nice trajectory of growth and incentive management fee. So the 8% to 10% that you see this year should be over the next couple years ramping up the 20% plus growth in IMS.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank","Just a quick follow-up on Kevin's comments earlier. When you talk about the Hilton Hawaiian Village deal, when you think about the broader portfolio, how many more opportunities do you guys think there are that are similar in scope and similar in nature to this?","Chris Nassetta","I'd say listen, we're working on it every day and we -- as you can tell from the Hawaiian Village description it's not like we woke up yesterday and said hey here is an idea, I mean it took us probably three-and-a-half years to get the entitlement, to be able to turn that loading dock into a 400 plus unit tower in on Waikiki Beach. And so we've been working on some of these. I'd say we clearly have a handful of these types of opportunities that are sizeable, I don't want to say it's this -- but that are meaningful sort of NPV value to the company. I mean the truth is we have a big real estate portfolio. So we have dozens and dozens of opportunities in that portfolio to create value in every way from an operating point of view and smaller value enhancement opportunities.","But the big one, there is probably a handful. There is a Hawaiian Village there; a number of things in New York and our biggest assets is the New York Hilton at the Waldorf Astoria, other assets in Hawaii, like Waikoloa potentially in London with the Park Lane and some others. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Those know me from my prior days as a Public Committee CEO. We would rather do it and then market it rather than market it and then do it. So we are very pleased to be able to announce the Hawaiian Village deal because it's done. We have got great progress on all of the others that I just mentioned. And I think you should expect to continue to see some good progress from us on all of those.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank","And then, if I could just one follow-up. I know you guys mentioned earlier index, RevPAR index, in terms of kind of share in the U.S. not so much from a development standpoint, more so from an operational standpoint, where do you guys see yourself taking it from not may be a specific competitor but within the segments, where do you guys see yourselves most kind of outpacing?","Chris Nassetta","That's always the question that we get and the truth in the matter is we don't ever really know because we know what's happening, otherwise which travel works, right. We know what's happening with us, we don't really know exactly what's happening with anybody else the way the system works. My sense is, and this is going to sound sort of like the obvious answer, it's a little bit of everywhere. I do think that for all the reasons I talked about, when I talked about innovation and I talked about honors and what we're doing in distribution and then what we're doing on online and mobile and e-checking and all these things, I think they suggest that the bigger, more powerful global brand are getting stronger. I'm not saying we're not taking some share from our big global competitors. I hope and my guess is we are a little bit, but I would guess, is sort of, without knowing very specifically, I would guess that more of the share is coming from the independent and the smaller regional and local players. So a little bit everywhere but may be a little bit more from there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","So two questions, first, just on debt any guidance on using free cash flow for may be an accelerated debt paydown in 2014 and linked to that your asset sales, your willingness to sell hotels any additional color on the target, the number of hotels you'd like to sell in 2014. How many are actually actively being marketed? And then, so I think to Carlo's question just a moment ago on timeshare inventory how do you balance selling your own versus selling somebody else's inventory? Obviously selling somebody else's inventory is almost like infinite return on investment or pretty close to it. On the other hand leaving assets on your balance sheet, it leaves your own assets on your balance sheet. So I'm trying to get a sense for how you're balancing that over the next couple of years?","Chris Nassetta","I'll take the second and third and may be ask Kevin to then talk about the debt side of it. So on sales we have -- we do not have a lot that we intend to sell in 2014. We do have a few what I'd describe as dribs and drabs, very small assets, a few in the UK that we've been working on. But would be I'd view it as given our scale the minimus. And the reason for that is I said it in my prepared comments that the short version of it is listen we think we're in a sweet spot of the ownership cycle. We like what's going on in those assets. We love what's going through that that portfolio is really very heavily influenced by the group business which is coming back.","We just invested huge amounts in over $2 billion over a period of time and in the assets we're getting the benefit of that. We got these value enhancement opportunities that we want to mind and we haven't been able to mind, not because we didn't know how to do it but because our debt structure really didn\u2019t allow us. So our attitude right now is other than as I say some very minor sales, which would be immaterial to really try and mind the value of this.","Over time as I said if we believe that there's an opportunity to create incremental shareholder value by doing something with some or all the real estate, we will not be shy about that. The likely way that we would do it would be really more in a sort of structured format, wouldn\u2019t have to be all of it, but it might be in very large chunks of it to make sure that we create tax efficiency. So it's not, as I said we're not in any way emotionally attached to the real estate. Our predecessors may be were, we're not. We're emotionally attached to driving shareholder value rate now. We think the right way to do that is to mind these opportunities and at least the short-term and look at where the market goes and where multiples are and look at whether at some point we think that there is an ARB opportunity where doing something with the real estate would create a greater value preposition for everybody involved.","On the timeshare inventory, listen I think the way to think about that is we're very thoughtful about where we're doing these deal and I think what I would say, it's really driven by the customer, right. So we're trying to do deals in markets with third-parties that are not overlapping with our inventory. So it is really driven and we are actively selling both our own inventory and what's remaining as well as third-party inventory. We have little or no overlap. It's really is where we end seeing the demand coming from a customer point of view, increasingly as you know, I gave the stat at the end of the year we were 78% in terms of inventory for third-parties. If you fast forward and you put the numbers in for the Hawaiian Village deal we're going to do, you're sort of in the low to mid 80s. So as time goes on, the fact of the matter is the vast majority of our inventory is from, is representing third-party. But we're actively selling everything that is on our balance sheet and it gets ultimately sort of driven by customer demand.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, Steve for the debt question, Chris mentioned $700 million to $900 million of cash available or free cash flow. We would use the entirety of that to repay the term loan. The term loan is floating rate. It's fully pre-payable with no questions. So it's our most efficient debt to repay. And our goal would be to continue use the LION share of our free cash flow to repay debt, but with goals of being investment grade and we think we can achieve that over the next two to three years. We finished the year at 5.2 times net debt to EBITDA. We think we will finish -- if we do that $700 million to $900 million we will finish 2014 in about 4.50 times.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Anthony Powell - Barclays","Hi, good morning it's actually Anthony Powell here for Felicia. How are you?","Chris Nassetta","Hey, Anthony, how are you doing?","Kevin Jacobs","How are you doing?","Anthony Powell - Barclays","Doing well. On supply growth there seems to be some supply growth in the focus service segment in the U.S. Do you see hitting the supply impacting some same store RevPAR trends at your focus service hotels in your portfolio?","Chris Nassetta","Not really. I mean, the truth is that that's where all the supply is. I kind of commented on that likely in my introductory remarks. There is very little full service getting done other than few municipal deals that are getting done around the country and almost zero luxury. So it really is all pretty much limited service. Some of that is urban and a few markets like the New York, DC, and other places, most of that is in suburban, secondary, and territory location.","What I would say is, I mean clearly, there is a little bit more supply coming. If last year, really get the aggregate data, it was sort of a little below 1%. We think this year it is going to be over 1%. Next year, probably if you look at all of the lead numbers, what's in the pipeline that will get under construction, it's still probably in our mind 1.5%, that's again a 30-year average of 2.5%. So at least over the next sort of two to three years we think it's very muted. We think really in terms of what we see going on, there is quite a bit of discipline in the market. There is money to develop but there's not a lot and it's only with the best developers that it's really getting done and the best brands.","Thankfully for us, I think we're viewed given the market share premiums we have as being amongst the best if not the best in that category. So as I said, we got 25% of what is under construction, and we only have 10% or 11% of the existing supply. So we feel pretty good. I don't think -- we don't that there is material impact from it until you get much higher in the supply cycle.","So I pick a number, I mean historically, I think you got to get up to 2% or getting up closer to the 30-year average, I think it's probably is the time we have to start to think about it. But we were closer to one then we are two or even one-and-a-half, I think we feel very good about it. And the fact is, demand should be growing and at a little bit faster pace in the U.S. because I think everybody would say -- and now with the government noise behind us at least for this year probably at least a couple of years, that you're going have better GDP growth which is going to drive greater demand growth in an environment where there is still tiny tidy pickup in supply when you look at the aggregate numbers.","Anthony Powell - Barclays","And one follow-up. Do you see any opportunities to add new brands to your portfolio? Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","The answer is yes, I did a very crazy job of alluding to that and I apologize for that. As I said, my sort of style those of you know me know what is like -- we want to do things and then market them for you guys and everybody else. So we do have a bunch of ideas. Right now, we're dealing as we talked about with Garden Inn with Embassy in China and a lot of our brands, the existing brands. We are being very strategic about how we deploy those and how we enter various markets and launch those in various regions of the world.","We do have some things that we are working on in terms of both new brands and potentially what I would describe as brand extensions of an existing brand. And I do expect sort of over the next two or three or four quarters that you're going to hear at least a couple of things from us in that regard. One, which I know everybody, loves to talk about in the boutique space, which I did ask probably more than any other question on earth and even though you didn't ask it, I will certainly answer it. We are definitely working on a concept there.","We have a little different view, which I will wait to explain may be on -- in the next -- a call or two out, but we have had and continue to have a little bit of reviews and our competitors or many of our competitors about how to do that and sort of what exact -- what it looks like, what price point it ends up at. We've done a ton of work, we are getting closer I would hope in the not too distant future we can -- you'll be hearing from us on that. That would probably be the first thing or amongst the first things that you would hear.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joshua Attie with Citi. Your line is open.","Joshua Attie - Citi","As we think about the 5% to 7% RevPAR guidance, what are the variables that put you at the high and low end? Is it the performance of group business, is it your ability to drive rate or are there markets that are question marks? And I know there are probably multiple items that influence your thinking, but where do you think the main levers are to the upside or downside or the biggest question marks in your mind as you think about this year?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. Listen, I think getting to the higher end would depend on the things you alluded to, that the continued strength that we've seen in transient, which has been strong. But we assume if you want to get to the higher end of that then you would have to have at or maybe even a little bit above sort of where the transient growth was. You need the group to show up, the group business to show up the way that the way that we're hoping and we think there is potential for that.","And probably I'd say you need nothing big to go wrong in the world. Right, I mean the problem whether there is upside and downside of being a very big globally diversified company that ultimately when Egypt is a problem more if when Japan is strong it's great, if Japan is weak they can drag you down. So I think -- I don't listen, I don't think it's -- I believe that we're pretty upset, we gave a range for a reason because it's a big company, a lot of things can happen around the world. We think that at the upper end of that range, it's possible or we wouldn't give you that range and I think it depends on those things. Continued slight uptick in transient, definite uptick in group, and so a nothing major going wrong around the world.","Joshua Attie - Citi","And I know you don't want to give too many details on projects until they're finalized, but can you talk broadly about your thoughts on the Waldorf in terms of a potential redevelopment?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, we have spent a lot of time and some money as you can see if any of you have been to the Waldorf, we've spent over the last five or six years about $175 million and some of that's sort of behind the wall, so you don't see it. Some of it is upfront, I mean, we've been working on the exterior of the building to do the work that needed to be done for about a 100 years. We did -- we have redone the Park Avenue lobby, the motor court. If you haven't seen I mean, amazing progress and done a lot of work to figure out sort of from a rooms point of view what we want to do.","We have not taken that next step, because we've been in the process of doing -- excuse me a whole bunch of work and analysis around what's the highest and best use would be from a -- from standpoint of maximizing the value to the shareholders of the company and there are a bunch of different ways to do that and there a bunch of different people, we could do that with recognizing that not to coy that we talk a lot about capital light, obviously it's really complete what we like to have at the Waldorf, certainly it would require a lot of capital.","So I would say to you by the end of this year hopefully sooner, we will be in a position to layout exactly what we think the plan is to the Waldorf both in terms of what we're going to do with it physically and who we might do it with in order to continue to focus on our being capital light.","And I'm sorry to be coy, again we're just in the middle, we've done a kind of work over a bunch of years, we're sort of in the middle of completing that work and I don't think it's going to be too far out before we can give you good sidelines.","We will fix the Waldorf that I will tell you and there a couple of different sort of major pathways to doing that and we're finishing the work to be able to conclude that.","Operator","This concludes today's Q&A session. I will turn the call over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Chris Nassetta","Well, thanks everybody. Listen, I said a couple of times, it's great to be back, it took us six year hiatus from the public market, but after 50, I think consecutive earnings calls it's nice to be back doing quarterly earnings calls. We are obviously very pleased with our results for 2013, both the fourth quarter full year. We feel great about the environment, very optimistic about 2014, and we will look forward to giving you an update after we complete our first quarter.","Thanks again for spending the time with us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, ma'am.","Jill Slattery","Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.","In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today.","We're happy to report a good finish to what was a great year for Hilton. In the fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and EPS once again exceeded our expectations. We continue to prove the resiliency of our business model as net unit growth exceeded our expectations and drove the majority of our bottom line and free cash flow growth.","We also continue to demonstrate the power of our network effect by increasing our industry leading market share premiums 100 basis points for the full year with all regions gaining share. Exceptional experiences for our guest drive better profits for our owners, generating higher returns for our shareholders. Speaking of returns for the full year, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends representing approximately 9% of our market cap. ","Turning to results, our system-wide RevPAR grew 3% for the year. Group business performed well throughout the year with RevPAR growth of 4%, slightly exceeding our expectations given particular strength in convention business across a number of key markets. Corporate transient trends were healthy with RevPAR up 2.6% for the year with some softness experienced in the fourth quarter. Leisure transient continue to grow, also up 2.6% for the year that fell shy of our expectations given greater than expected impact from events and calendar shifts and a bit of softer demand in the later part of the year.","Looking to the year ahead we expect similar to modestly slower trends versus what we saw in full year 2018. Macro indicators continue to support generally favorable fundamentals and a good backdrop for continued pricing increases despite modest deceleration in GDP expectations versus prior estimates. Group trends are solid with 2019 bookings up in the mid-single digits and corporate negotiated rates are up just over 2% slightly ahead of last year's growth.","Given the modestly lower macro forecasts coupled with uncertainties in some international markets, we're adjusting our full year RevPAR guidance range to 1% to 3%. An area of the business where we continue to have greater visibility is net unit growth. Our strategic approach to development has allowed us to establish one of the largest and most diversified systems and pipelines in the industry.","In 2018, we opened more than one hotel per day and had the best year of openings in our history, adding over 450 hotels and achieving net unit growth of nearly 57,000 rooms or approximately 7% growth year-over-year. We ended the year with roughly 5,700 properties and 913,000 rooms across 113 countries and territories. It was also a record year for construction starts and signings.","During 2018, we started construction on more than 83,000 rooms, the best year in our history. We signed 108,000 rooms marking our fourth consecutive year of signings over 100,000 rooms and are on track for another year of record signings with increases expected across both U.S. and international markets.","We remain focused on building a presence everywhere in the world our guests want to travel. With more than half of our pipeline located outside the United States and 35 new countries represented, we have tremendous opportunities to grow our global footprint for the foreseeable future. Roughly 30% of our pipeline is located in Asia Pacific, a region that continues to benefit from powerful long-term secular trends supported by a growing middle class in China.","In the fourth quarter we celebrated the opening of our 50th Hampton by Hilton in China with an additional 200 in the pipeline. We also debuted our accessible lifestyle brand in the region with the opening of the Canopy by Hilton Chengdu City Center. With more than 75% of our pipeline in Asia Pacific under construction, we expect to open approximately 20,000 rooms in the region in 2019 and achieve roughly 20% net unit growth.","The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region accounts for nearly 20% of our pipeline and has an increasing number of Hilton Honors members driving demand for our products. In particular we continue to gain great traction with our newer brands and expect positive momentum to continue with the recent launches of Motto, our urban lifestyle micro hotel brand; and LXR, our luxury collection brand.","We celebrated several milestone openings in the region last quarter including the Hilton Beirut downtown, the Lincoln Plaza London, Curio; and we look forward to celebrating the opening of our first LXR property in Europe, the Biltmore, Mayfair in London in the coming weeks, as well as adding several other unique properties to the collection in the coming year.","In the United States we continue to focus on serving guests for every stay occasion across a variety of price points. In the fourth quarter we celebrated the opening of our 50th Tru hotel, continuing its momentum as the fastest hotel launch in industry history. This year we expect to open another 75 of the 500 hotels in the pipeline and under development.","We're also thrilled to welcome the Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead to our system during the quarter. This exciting addition enhances the brand's presence on the East Coast and brings our total luxury and lifestyle portfolio to 73 properties open globally with another 73 in the pipeline.","For the full year we gained over 14 million new Honors members, bringing total membership to 85 million at year end, up approximately 20% year-over-year. Growth is coming from every major region of the world with roughly 40% of members coming from outside the United States. Our Honors members now account for approximately 60% of system-wide occupancy, which is up 200 basis points for the full year.","We expect continuous enhancements to our Honors program coupled with innovations like Digital Key and Connected Room, to continue to drive more direct relationships with our guests. Since its launch in 2015, we have scaled Digital Key to more than 4,100 properties globally and guests have opened more than 40 million doors to date, using the app based feature.","We also rolled out over 1,800 Connected Rooms with plans to bring the technology to approximately 300 hotels by the end of 2019 enabling guests to create more personalized travel experiences through our partnerships with Netflix and Showtime and other customization features.","Last November in preparation for celebrating our 100th anniversary this year, we announced the release of research that showed the positive impact Hilton has had on the people and communities we serve. Thanks to the Hilton effect, during the first 100 years we welcomed 3 billion guests, employed 10 million team members and contributed $1 trillion in total economic impact to the world.","As we prepare to celebrate our centennial, we are optimistic about what the future holds for Hilton and believe we are well positioned to continue driving growth ahead of industry trends. For 2019, we expect RevPAR growth together with strong net unit growth to drive significant free cash flow generation, enabling us to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy and to continue delivering returns for shareholders.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin, to get into more details in the quarter and our outlook for the year ahead.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks Chris, and good morning everyone.","In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 2% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, at the lower end of our guidance range. Lower than anticipated growth in transient largely due to softer leisure demand across the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions weighed on results. Group RevPAR exceeded our expectations increasing nearly 4%. We estimate the calendar shifts and weather events tempered system-wide RevPAR growth by roughly 40 basis points.","Adjusted EBITDA of $544 million exceeded the high-end of our guidance range, increasing 12% year-over-year. Our performance was largely driven by better than expected licensees and upside across our ownership portfolio given RevPAR gains in London and continental Europe.","In the quarter, Management franchise fees increased 14% to $532 million, ahead of our expected 9% to 11% range as results continue to benefit from strong net unit growth and better performance from our co-brand and credit card program. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items of $0.79 also beat expectations.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook; fourth quarter comparable U.S. Re PAR grew 1.1% entirely driven by ADR growth. Solid group trend supported results but growth was somewhat tempered by softer transient given the weather and calendar related disruption. Our full year 2018 U.S. RevPAR grew 2.2%, given expected upticks in performance in group and business transient and consistent levels of performance in leisure transient.","For full year 2019, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth consistent with our system-wide guidance range based on expected steady fundamentals and continued pricing increases. In the Americas outside the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR grew 6.9% versus the prior year, given an uptick in trends across Mexico coupled with strong ADR growth in Canada, similar to trends throughout the year.","For full year 2018 RevPAR grew 6.1% in the region and we expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth to be in a range consistent with our system-wide guidance. RevPAR in Europe grew 7.2% in the quarter driven by stronger than anticipated transient trends particularly in London as increased U.S. travel to the U.K. boosted results.","For the full year RevPAR in Europe outperformed expectations increasing 6.9% as a result of strong transient gains most notably in Vienna and London. We expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth in Europe to be consistent with our system-wide range given continued strength in transient trends in markets like Turkey partially offset by tough comps in Russia following last year's World Cup and uncertainty surrounding Brexit.","In the Middle East and Africa region RevPAR was slightly positive in the quarter. Similar to trends we saw on prior quarters leisure transient gains in Egypt were largely offset by declines in the Arabian Peninsula due to supply demand imbalances. For full year 2018 RevPAR was up 1.8% in the region. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be roughly flat given weaker than expected inbound travel to Egypt and continued softness in the Arabian Peninsula.","In the Asia Pacific region RevPAR increased 3.4% in the quarter following a broader slowdown in leisure transient demand stemming in part from decelerating inbound travel coupled with impacts from weather conditions and natural disasters. Softening domestic leisure demand in China also weighed on growth in the quarter with RevPAR up just over 5%. For full year 2018 RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region grew 6.5% largely driven by strength in China particularly in the first half of the year.","In China RevPAR increased approximately 10% for the full year. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth for the Asia Pacific region in the mid single-digit range with mid to high single-digit RevPAR growth in China accounting for continued deceleration in economic growth.","Moving to guidance for full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA of 2.24 billion to $2.29 billion representing a year over increase of approximately 8% at the midpoint. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items and under are updated definition of $3.66 to $3.78.","For the first quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $470 million to $490 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.73 to $0.78. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchase.","Moving on the capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 a share during the fourth quarter for a total of $181 million in dividends for the year. For the full year 2018, we were returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share.","For 2019, we expect to return between $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details of our fourth quarter and full year results in our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up related to your question. Denise can we have our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question this morning will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Greff","I\u2019ll just start off with a question on pipeline and room's growth and certainly RevPAR growth. Obviously the room\u2019s growth in the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we had modeled and if you look at the pipeline at the end of the year was down a little bit sequentially. How much of that pipeline - that sequential pipeline decrease is a function of just more rooms opening up and to what extent is it just calling of some of the stuff that's under construction. We can understand the pipeline change a little bit better?","Chris Nassetta","Yes it's a combination of things Joe but a good question and one that we've been getting a lot so I'm glad you asked it and happy to answer it. First, I would look at the full year because quarter to quarter there's always noise going on if you look at the full year pipeline was up 6%. We would fully expect as we think about this year and we go through this year that we will again and the year with pipeline up it may vary quarter-to-quarter but we think directionally it will go up.","I think in the fourth quarter two things happened both of which you noted. We came in much harder on deliveries which was great which was why net unit growth instead of being in the mid 6s ended up basically at 7. But you know the downside of that is it comes out of the pipeline when it is delivered of course when it delivered they're paying us fee. So we'd much rather get into that state and in the pipeline.","And then we always - throughout the year in this case at the end of the year sort of look at everything its under construction and things that we don't think are going to really happen over reasonable period of time we clean those up. And so it's a combination of those two things.","And the second part of that's an important not nuance in a sense because when we clean those up and get them out of the pipeline it allows us an opportunity to replace those deals. If you leave deals in the pipeline that aren\u2019t going to happen you sort - you\u2019ve taken a location at a place.","So we try and be really diligent we're great with our owners if they need a little bit more time obviously we try and work with them. But at a point where we think it's not really, not going to happen we want to get it out. So it's a combination of those things again 6% up year-over-year I would think when we end the year certainly based on what we're seeing you will see sequential improvement year-over-year through 2019.","Joe Greff","And then my follow up both you Chris and Kevin referenced that later in the fourth quarter later in the year you saw some leisure transient softness and you reference it in the U.S. and China. Can you talk about that and how much of it may be driven by one-time things that were disruptive to travel versus something that's more macro in nature. Can you help us understand maybe what some of the drivers there were\u2026","Chris Nassetta","The bigger decline that you saw if you look across the world in leisure transient were in China for the reasons that I think are pretty obvious in terms of both trade war issues, as well as the slower economy as well as some weather related things that were going on. We did see some of it in other regions as well Middle East, Africa we saw some weakness in leisure transient. And in the U.S., I would say was reasonably modest and in the U.S. And I would say not to avoid the questions.","Looking at the end of the year even looking into January it\u2019s very difficult particularly at the end of the year with all the noise related to the overlapping weather issues, the change in day of week year-over-year as well the holiday shifts. As much as I'd love to say I can give you really scientific hard stats on exactly what happened with leisure transient at the end of the year and in January it's just hard to do.","I would say we didn't see a dramatic difference. If you look at the full year it's interesting we went into the year I think on this call last year we said here is what we think is going to happen we think group is going to pick up because it's getting stronger and we have a great position. You'll remember in 2017 we had quite a dynamic year as industry in corporate transient we said we think we're going to see nice pickup coming out of tax reform. And we think leisure transient is generally going to hang in there.","Basically that's exactly what happened for the full year. At the end of the year when you got into the third quarter to a degree and definitely in fourth quarter with all the noise on holidays and weather impacts, it just the data got very garbled and it got very choppy.","So I think time will tell. I think our view is that the guidance of one to three is that you know group is hanging in there really well. I think if there's an expectation that you're going to have broader economic growth that is still good in the U.S. and good around the world. But a little bit less than what people thought a quarter ago that that will ultimately mean that both leisure and business transient will be a little bit less then what we might have experienced last year. And that sort of baked into the 1 to 3 guidance that we gave.","Operator","The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli","I just have one and I appreciate the comments on the call thus far. With respect to the capital return, the range that you guys have provided is a little bit wider and acknowledging that there were one primary but really two exogenous events that kind of beefed up your buyback in 2018. As you think about the range for 2019 with respect to the buyback and excluding the dividends, what do you - other than kind of the leverage profile that that you're looking to target, how are you guys kind of thinking about within that range what are the key drivers of being towards the high end as opposed to the lower end?","Chris Nassetta","It's a good question. I'll start with the range. Yes, the range is you know obviously we gave it, so you can see it's $500 million. Actually it's only a touch larger - only a touch wider than the range we started out with last year. And at the end of the day it's a quarter of a total leverage on our EBITDA base, not even not even a quarter of a turn leverage.","And so the way we thought about giving guidance was we set the mid-point at 3.25x leverage. So, if the EBITDA forecast - based on the EBITDA forecast we have and the capital return at the mid-point that would leave us at 3.25x at the end of the year which as you know is at the mid-point of our stated range of 3x to 3.5x.","And so - and then what we try to do is bracket it at a quarter of return 250 on each side from there. And you're right, we did have a couple of events - opportunities last year to buyback an outsized amount of stock and bring a little bit of stock buybacks forward into the earlier part of the year and that combined with a little bit of extra cash we had at the time enabled us to lean in on particularly on the HNA transaction.","And so as the year plays out, this year we're given a little bit of a wider range and it'll be the same type of analysis. If we see opportunities to buy little more, we might do a little more, if we don't like the way the world is headed or how we feel about the outlook for the economy, we might do a little bit less.","Operator","The next question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please ago ahead.","Harry Curtis","A quick follow-up on Joe's question. Wanted to get a little bit more detail on the pipeline in China; does it stand to reason that as their economy slows that the pipeline resale should slow as well?","Chris Nassetta","And the reason, yes. That is not what our experience has been to date. Our pipeline - we believe in China is in good shape and we believe is continuing to grow, talk with the team's multiple times a week and we still have a lot of activity. The nature of the activity as has been discussed on a number of prior calls has definitely been shifting more towards mid-market opportunities than higher end opportunities. We're still certainly doing a bunch of Hilton's and Waldorfs and Conrads and DoubleTree's and even Embassy now.","But more of the bulk is shifting to mid-market, and China for us right now that really is Hampton by Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn. That stands the reason because what's going on is growth in the middle class, they want to travel and that's what they can afford.","So I think we continue to see now the bulk of the pipeline growth coming from that. And so far so good, the relationship with Plateno is working out well, they continue to actually ramp up their activities. So, yes, I mean if the China economy slows down - continues to slow and stays growing at a slower pace, I do think at some point it will have - it has to have a ripple effect. But I want to be clear that we really haven't seen it. We delivered in China last year about 11,000 rooms and that was up close to 50% from the prior year and based on what's in the cooker right now that I'm pretty darn confident will happen, we'll be up another 30%, 33% this year.","And some of those are short - relatively short gestation because the Hampton Inn opportunities move fast. I mean they're moving through the pipeline in 12 or 18 months sort of time frame. So, so far so good but China will have ups and downs just to be clear just like every other market in the world. The long-term trend is up and if you draw a line through it over the next 20 or 30 years is definitely going up but they'll have the ups and downs just like the U.S. pipeline and deliveries to.","But right now we're in pretty good shape I think for the next probably two years given what we have in the pipeline and what sort of - and already under construction in addition to now having conversion opportunities which is kind of a new thing in China. I think we'll do more conversions this year in China than we've ever done. I think we're feeling very good about the next couple of years in China.","Harry Curtis","And then the follow-up question is, you're making some nice progress on development of the luxury portfolio. Can you walk us through what that pipeline looks like and where you are today and thinking ahead maybe two to four years where you're likely to go with the luxury portfolio?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah, we are. Thank you for saying it. We're very proud of what we've been doing in luxury. We've been added for a long time. I've been here 11 going on 12 years and one of the first things that we started working on when I got here is making sure that we had the aspirational product in the portfolio for all of our customers and importantly our most loyal customers in Honors. That's the kind of product they want.","As we've been doing it the old fashioned way. We have not been out buying things. I suspect that is not something that will be in our future because there's nothing that really we think is really possible. And so we've been grinding it out and doing it the right way and in focusing on both the existing brands of Conrad and Waldorf but also with adding brands to the portfolio importantly LXR which we talked about earlier, Canopy in the lifestyle space and the possibility of other things that are in the skunkworks right now that would add to our luxury lifestyle brand portfolio.","And I would say \u2013 my believe that I've been at it now as long as I've been here as I said is that we've really hit stride in the sense of. We have become the fastest growing luxury brands or the major players and we are starting now to really be able to find ourselves with both Conrad and Waldorf and Canopy in the right locations in the right cities both from an urban and resort point of view to where we're creating a real distribution network that matters. I think these are brands that are really starting to resonate based on the research that we do with our customer base and more broadly.","And I think the next as much as I think we've hit stride. I think over the next three to five years you're going to see some pretty amazing things happening within both these brands. We're getting ready to open up a spectacular new Conrad in Washington DC, Downtown DC in the next 30 days. I was just in Waldorf, New York last Monday doing the model room review that is if you look in that building there is a lot going on that's happening. We're hopeful that that's going to deliver in 2021 and it will absolutely be a spectacular product.","Couple a weeks ago I was touring the under construction Waldorf in London. In the Admiralty Arch building facing Buckingham Palace which will be an absolute jewel box and a whole bunch of others that are coming that really add to what is a growing, but very special portfolio. So I feel really good about where we are. I mean technically in Waldorf today we have 31 hotels. We've got another 19 in the pipeline. I mentioned a couple of those similar statistics for Conrad, 33 opened and 19 in the pipeline and great things happening. San Francisco, I mean I won't go through the whole list.","But suffice to say, we've looked at the world and figured out like where our customer, where our luxury customer wants to be and we are hard at work if we're not already there in making sure that we get there in a relatively short period of time. So I think it's working, I think if we look at the share numbers in those brands they've been growing at a really nice pace. What our customers are telling us is very positive and I think we're really starting to hit stride.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","Chris, I just wanted to go back to China for a quick moment and one thing we've seen in the data is that Hilton continues to pretty meaningfully outperform some of the broader industry data in China as it relates to what we've see in RevPAR in that market. I'm sure this has to do with probably a variety of different mix factors, but when you guys kind of look at your own experience I mean could you just help us maybe pass the part a little bit. Do you think you're benefiting from city mix, market share gains, brand mix, ramp up of new properties, what's helping drive some of the strength that we're seeing there? Just on overall absolute basis, I do understand that it obviously slowed sequentially?","Chris Nassetta","As I would say but a lot thing, it's a combination of things. It's not any one thing but I think the properties that we're opening are spectacular properties in really good locations. We've been incredibly disciplined about what we're doing, who we're doing it with, what markets, what brands to get it right, and that is helping us. If you look at market share numbers, our market share numbers are growing at a very rapid pace. I don't have the exact China number but in APAC we grew market share numbers which would be driven largely by China almost 300 basis points.","APAC overall we are now driving system-wide market share of 115, and China would be comparable to that. By the way that eclipse is our U.S. market share which also grew in the year. So we are driving great properties, great commercial delivery, driving great performance that is taking share from the competition. There is also in fact even though that you're looking at comp numbers, many of the you know in China particularly at the upper end less so at the lower, but if you look at like DoubleTree and above, the ramp periods in China are longer than you would find in the United States as an example.","And so we do get the benefit even though year-over-year these are comp and they've been in the system they're still ramping in a way that is more significant than you would find in other parts of the world. So we are clearly getting a benefit in that regard to. But the largest part of it honestly is we're driving huge amounts of share growth.","Shaun Kelley","And I mean it's interesting on the share growth, so then just a follow-up with that. I mean you mentioned location being a critical factor there. Is there also a piece of this that's critical mass of brand awareness I mean I think if we were to rewind a decade ago it almost probably a little in a different places it would relate to sort of maybe brand awareness in China but obviously been super aggressive there. So is that a piece of it or, and kind of how would you measure that or look at that?","Chris Nassetta","Definitely, I mean our brand awareness has always been pretty good honestly but it is much, much better. So it's partly that. It's also commercial infrastructure. We made the decision years ago like you know five, seven years ago to probably more than that probably seven to nine years ago relatively early in my tenure even though we didn't have many hotels that we were going to invest in the commercial infrastructure to make sure that we build the neural network to deliver commercially for our owners. Because if you want to grow there and we're using third-party money and you open a bunch of hotels and they don\u2019t do well and they tell their friends you know it doesn't really work out so well.","So we sort of invested ahead of the growth curve remembering 11 years ago like when we had five hotels in China. So we had a very small business. Fast forward today you know opening in the pipeline we've got you know 450, 500 hotels. So we knew what was coming and we said even in back in our private days we need to invest ahead of that right. Now we've grown into it obviously with the scaling of the business but we built critical commercial infrastructure there to allow us to deliver. In addition to having the right properties with the right owners, and the right locations and having brands that resonate. There's a whole bunch of investment that's gone on over time in the commercial delivery.","Operator","The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Just in terms of distribution you highlighted that you had seen a good increase in loyalty member distribution. But could you just talk about the mix between OTA's, property direct, call centers et cetera and how that's shifting? Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","I mean I think the short answer on that is, as you can see with our latest campaigns with Anna Kendrick and a whole bunch of other things we're very focused on driving direct relationships and direct business. And if you look at our web-direct channels, they remain the fastest growing channels that we have and growing at a much faster rate than OTA channels.","Now we still believe there is a lot more that we can do. As we have said our book-direct efforts which are more than marketing. There's a marketing element to it but making sure that the value proposition is the most compelling value proposition from the standpoint of how we price our products. From the standpoint of the technology and the other things that enable a better experience for folks that are part of our Honor system and have a direct relationship. We are going to \u2013 we are in a mode of we're going to constantly be reinvesting and focusing on that.","So that will be an always on effort, but it's working and if you look at the numbers for the year our web-direct channels of all types grew three times the rate of other channels.","Thomas Allen","And then you highlighted the strength and the credit card business in the fourth quarter. Is there way to quantify it and talk qualitatively or quantifiably how that should benefit or how that should go forward in 2019? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Thomas in the fourth quarter we had a great quarter in that program and the card products have been very well received by consumers. And it's still a relatively new program so it's starting to get its legs and ramp up. Our card signings in the quarter were up almost 25% we spend in the quarter up kind of mid single-digits.","And so the way to think about that going forward is as those signings mature and we get more spend and the program gets more popular we expect that to continue increase with increases in spend next year expected to be well in excess of that mid single-digits this year. So we're very positive about the outlook for that program.","Operator","The next question will be from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","Want to go back to maybe some market share data. Do you have your overall RevPAR index and how that\u2019s trending for the portfolio your direct bookings percentage and then are your share of global hotel supply?","Chris Nassetta","Sure in terms of index here is what I gave you I shared a teeny bit of it well today pack my other comments, but I can give you across the board. So U.S. market share ended last year a little over 114% which was up 80 basis points system-wide U.S. EMEA as we have sort of three mega regions so EMEA finished the year at 116 again I think I noted on the last call given that we are a capital like business and depending on third parties to build hotels for us to continue to grow. There's no more important statistic that we look at then our market share because that's what people why people are making that investment.","And for the first time ever these numbers I'm giving you are reflective of the EMEA and APAC not only having great share growth but I\u2019ll finish giving you the numbers but eclipsing our U.S. market share. So reflective of the fact that we are now creating this network effect and have made you know have brands and enough distribution, enough commercial capabilities as I described in APAC that the whole ecosystem is working really well. So EMEA ended the year 116 up almost 200 basis points APAC ended the year at 115 up almost 300 basis points.","So, if you, blend all that together a bit over 114 just given the heavy weighting of the U.S. In terms of our direct business, our direct channels represent about 75% percent of our overall business. If you look at all our web channels those represent about half of that roughly and 40% or 50% of that is sort of on our app which is a growing at a pretty astronomical rate. Obviously we like that that's where we want to continue to push as many of our loyal customers as we can that\u2019s absolute most efficient channel. So we're really pleased with the progress there.","Again lots of incremental strategies in play, which won\u2019t get into in detail on this call to continue to give our customers even more reasons to want to go through those channels, because it's a better price, a better deal. And the experience will be better because of all of the other things they get with technology and otherwise as a result of being a member and buying that way. What was the last question\u2026","Wes Golladay","The global hotel supply?","Chris Nassetta","Share of global supply like 5% I think something like that. So we're almost four times that in terms of share of rooms under construction in the world, last number I saw was about 5%.","Operator","And the next question will be from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling","I guess as a follow up to your comments on conversions being a new thing in China and also the comments on brand awareness improving there. You mentioned in the past that conversions tend to ramp during tough backdrop and can buttress softer or new construction. But how do you think about the economics to run an independent versus a Hilton brand. And how they have evolved over the past kind of nine years of expansion and as we think about how that may dictate conversions if the environment stays challenged?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, conversions did ramp up last year. I mean we went basically from 20% low 20 and change to 25. I've said on other calls I mean we peaked through the Great Recession in the low 40s that was an unusual time. I suspect we will not get back to those kind of numbers, but I think yeah clearly as condition got a little more challenging throughout last year, financing got a little bit more difficult over the last couple of years. We've seen more conversions than I suspect we will again both because I think in the U.S. you'll see some ramp up in the opportunity. But also I suggested in APAC and certainly EMEA where we have already had those opportunities you'll see an uptick.","And of course we've been adding brands to make that more possible. In the last go around and the Great Recession we basically had one core conversion brand and that was DoubleTree and it was a gift that has given us a lot. I mean it really has performed well in every regard, we still have DoubleTree but it has broader distribution.","Now we have Curio, Tapestry, LXR in addition to DoubleTree. And of course we have Hilton another other opportunities as well. So we feel very good about sort of positioning ourselves to take advantage of it. I do suspect that you are in a trend you will see a trend line that is inching up from the low 20s to the mid 20s and I think I suspect it'll keep going.","The value proposition at a high level is pretty straightforward. The reason to come in to the Hilton system we just talked about market is really twofold. We think in almost every case we can drive better revenues. Our system will drive better revenues, our average market share around the world is over 114% that suggests that versus the average we're driving 14% higher revenues that's a lot of revenue okay. And yes they got to pay us, but that's a lot of extra revenue to pay with. The other thing that we afford them through both our deals with all of our distribution partners as well as opportunities with our supply management function.","We afford them cost energy opportunities so we believe we can significantly in most cases lower distribution costs and significantly lower the cost of they're buying certain products and services if they attach themselves to HS and Hilton supply management. And so it's a powerful combination when you put it together driving a big premium on revenue and reducing expenses means more profit and there's plenty enough we think in almost every case to pay us. Our fair share and for them to make a lot more money which is why a lot of people choose to do it.","Stephen Grambling","I guess as a very quick follow up just to make sure I heard you correctly I guess on China. Is there any reason why that trend would be different as we think about the potential for conversions\u2026","Chris Nassetta","I think that the reason is - first of all China is weakening a little bit right. So they've been in a prolong expansionary phase and while they're still, by the way let's keep in perspective. They're still growing at 2 to 3, 2.5 times the rate of the United States and the West maybe if you put Europe in there more than that they're still growing at a good pace, but at a lower pace than they've been growing for a long time. So that one situation the other thing that's going on as you had a big boom over the last 20 years, but really over the last 10 to 15 of deals getting done and a lot of those deals are coming due.","So you have relatively new hotels that have been built in the cycle where there at the end of their term of the contract. You put together a little bit weaker environment in a world where people have optionality and we're driving industry leading market share we think that bodes well for our opportunity.","Operator","The next question will be from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Anthony Powell","You mentioned the 14 million new Hilton Honors members there were lot of changes and also loyalty programs based last year. You think you may gain some mind share among loyalty focused customer at the expense of some others given some of the changes that your competitors?","Chris Nassetta","I don't - I mean it's really hard for us to know clearly we're experiencing very high growth rates we don't think by the way those growth rates are going to abate this year. Our goal is to have over 100 million members when we finish this year, and I'm highly confident that we will be able to do that. So we think that the pace will continue. We have done a bunch of stuff which you can see and that has been publicized throughout the system both the lower tiers, but particularly at the higher tiers to make the program more appealing and it's resonating.","Obviously we're getting members from somewhere people that are already frequent travelers. So to some degree I suspect that we are benefiting by getting members of other programs that are shifting their loyalty. What we're focused on is really just creating as I said a hyper compelling reason why people want to be a member of our club. Like that Honors isn't just about points, Honors is about getting the best value by points by price and it's about getting unique experiences both with the technology and other ways, like our relationship with Live Nation and Formula 1 and a whole bunch of other relationships that are just things that are hard to replicate and that people experientially like and choose to sort of migrate their way towards us.","So I can't give you hard data on like who is come exactly from where and to a degree as long they're great customers that we can get engaged with us, we don't care. We want them in the system. The thing that we didn't say that I'm actually most proud of, it's really important to have a big - we all focus on like we got $85 million we're going to have a $100 million and that's great, it's a big number, right. And it's growing and it's going to keep growing at a great pace.","What's most important is engagement, it's like how many of those members are actually actively engaged with us that are coming, staying with us and I\u2019m going to say I know what the number is now. I think five or six years ago I think we would have said we probably had 15% to 20% of that number that we're really engaged. Today, 50% percent; so half the 42 million so a teeny bit less than half we would view as are engaged with us. That they are actually they have recent stay activity and purchase activity, that's a big deal, right.","Big numbers are great. How many people are actually buying? I mean we could auto enroll the whole world if we wanted. We could have a 1 billion people if we wanted, but that's a lot \u2013 my team doesn't like that idea. But it's really how do we get people in the program that we can get engage with us and staying with us and buying our products. And that statistic I think is really, really important one.","Anthony Powell","Got it. And I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you expect rate growth to play a bigger role in RevPAR growth of U.S. this year. That's interesting given price power has been soft recently. What gives you confidence in your ability to push rate a bit more?","Chris Nassetta","Well, I mean if you look at fourth quarter a 100% of our growth was rate. If you look at the whole year in the U.S., 80% of our RevPAR growth was rate growth. I think it will be similar this year. So that's what gives me the confidence. Now you would I think argue well but it's not a high number, and I would say you're right and \u2013 but there are other reasons for that. I think the other reasons for that which I've talked about a lot and I think it's come up on prior calls, have more to do with the fact that you're in a sort of a low compression environment. The overall economic growth is fairly tepid inflation. Throughout this period it has been fairly tepid. You've had a lot of volatility particularly in the U.S. around politics and things that create caution.","And so I think as compared to prior cycles where you had much more robust broader economic growth, that sort of flowed through. So I think it's sort of stands to reason and what has been a relatively low growth environment that that's what you get. The other thing that's going on that I don't think many have focused on is what's going on is really good in the sense that \u2013 but it affects the rate growth numbers over the last several years and that is mix of business.","So, if you look at the overall occupant system-wide occupancy for Hilton, we are over 300 basis points higher occupancy than we've ever been in our 100 year history. Why? The bulk of it is weekends and off peak times we've just gotten much smarter about filling up. Oh, is that good? Sure it's good because we make money. Our job is to drive returns to our owners and they are getting a rate that they make money on and their bottom line profitability on an absolute dollar basis is higher.","The consequence of it though is when you look at rates it creates a scenario where that business by definition on weekends is at a lower rate. And so when you blend in that mix at a lower rate it sort of - it dilutes the story on rate growth, which I think is an illusion. Obviously, our owners and we are much better off with that incremental business even though when you blended in because its lower rated business, it sort of dilutes the rate growth story.","And so I think \u2013 again, this isn't super positive for our owners that we're able to do this and we're not, we have not been of the mind that there is a big rate issue that's sort f out there. It's short of what I just said, short of mix and really a low compression environment.","Operator","The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","I wanted to ask about group business because I know it's probably difficult to get visibility and then there are trade wars and government shutdowns and things that you don't know when you're giving guidance. But just kind of looking at last year, it look like initially you thought group would be up mid single-digit and then there was a pointer in the year you got more conservative. You thought would be up 3 to 4 and it came in at 4. So I guess just thinking about your expectation for 2019, you talked about being up mid single-digit. Can you tell us maybe what group bookings came in Q4 versus the same time last year just so we could think about sort of a incremental like how the outlook is changing in the most recent months?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah, Robin it's a good question. I think what you're referencing is earlier in the year we were talking about the business on the books being up mid single-digits which is what it was. And for fourth quarter it ended up realizing it for. So pretty close to where the book was. Our book for 2019 is also up mid single digits. That doesn't mean that that's exactly where it's going to realize because it depends on how many members of the block show up and what they decide to pay and who decides to cancel them.","As you know there's a lot that goes into it, but I don't know why built into our expectations as we said is that group business will remain solid and so we'll see what the experience ends up looking like in 2019. But the business on the books is still up in the mid single-digit.","Robin Farley","And then just want to follow-up on the leisure commentary. I know you talked about some of the issues in China where the bigger declines were. But just looking at the U.S. rates, there was some modest leisure decline. If that was sort of related to weather or calendar things, can you talk about how leisure looks to the degree do you have some visibility so far for Q1 in 2019? In other words, are there \u2013 is that sort of softening, I don't want to use the word softening if it's not the word you'd use; but are you seeing about a little bit here and early 2019 as well?","Chris Nassetta","I would say it's noisy and it was noisy at the end of last year for the reasons that you highlighted. All the movements of pieces around day of week, around holiday, around the overlapping weather. And it's been noisy. It was noisy in January largely to do with the government shutdown. So again, I'm not trying to be evasive. It's hard to judge it right now. I mean to be perfectly fair we think our expectation for the year is leisure is going to be fine. That leisure is going to grow, we think it will probably grow less than last year. We think business transient will probably grow less because we have an expectation that's based on consensus view of the world that broader economic growth is going to be a little lighter.","When we look at the trends that we see in January, they're noisy but we look - we can get a decent sense of February\/March. We think that they are supportive of the range and outcome that I just described and that we've given you today, which would be a little bit lower than last year.","Operator","The next question will be from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes","Hi I'm curious on what you're seeing out of Europe as it relates to Ford demand specially on the leisure side out of the U.K. Certainly we're getting some signals from the cruise lines or the floating hotels that some of the European based cruise brands are really seeing some difficulty as it relates to travel around Brexit I wonder what you are seeing for the hotel side?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah Patrick, I mean similar to sort of, we\u2019re seeing a little bit on what Chris just said, it's a little bit hard to have this ability. They have their fair share noise over there with Brexit, sort of the way we've have a little bit of noise here and as you know the lead time on unlike cruise's lead time on some of our business is pretty short in that area.","So we've kind of given you guidance that we think you know the region is going to be within the range, we'd expect leisure to be within that and there's a number of ways it could go. Obviously the fourth quarter was quite strong in continental Europe and London. Driven by leisure and U.S. inbound to the U.K. and to continental Europe in particular. And so there's a - those trends could continue but right now we're saying kind of within the range.","Operator","The next question will be from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead","Bill Crow","Chris, if you look at the front end of growth, really talking about application volumes and construction starts, any changes in those especially as you think about your three mega regions?","Chris Nassetta","No, I mean overall it's been trending as you heard in the numbers in our prepared comments. Overall it's been trending reasonably consistently in terms of the deals that we've been signing. We've obviously been converting those to construction and delivery at a higher rate of productivity. The make-up of it has shifted a bit, the U.S. not surprisingly has been a little bit slower and the rest of the world has been a little bit faster.","But the net result has been the same and that's sort of the beauty of a big global business that is diversified the way we are and we like to think that we're pretty quick on our feet and that we're good at anticipating sort of the mega trends in terms of what's going on with demand growth, what's going on with flows of capital, so that we pivot in the right ways and the right time.","So I'm pretty confident we will be able to continue to do that, which is why we're saying we think we'll have another record year in signings. I actually - well last year maybe was a little bit lighter in the U.S. and little bit heavier in the rest of the world. I think particularly given some momentum we have lived through and now with the addition of Moxy - Motto, that the U.S. will probably be flat a bit up this year but the net result would be I think for the next year to sort of we're comfortable that we can assign a similar amount to what we've been doing over the last few years.","Bill Crow","I take it you're not merging with Marriott to get the Moxy brand?","Chris Nassetta","No.","Bill Crow","Kevin, one from me for you, I would have thought maybe that share repurchases in the fourth quarter would have been a little bit more robust given the stock market sell-off. Were there black out period issues or what was your hesitation I guess at that point?","Kevin Jacobs","Bill, that's good question. There wasn't really hesitation. We ended up coming in at the top end of the range and so we did - we think we were down to a range of 1.8 to 1.9 at the - as of last earnings and we ended up at 1.9. So we kept it going and then yes, the very end of the year and leading into the beginning of this year you are on a 10b5-1 plan because your blackout period will remain, but we remain buying of course but you're on a plan where you don't get to control it. So nothing more complicated than that.","Operator","The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask you on the reduction in third-party commission group rates that you put in place I think some time ago but we've heard that maybe you've put in some additional flexibility on the part of the owners or bookings and maybe you could just provide an update on that front?","Chris Nassetta","No. I mean we're not going to get any details on individual deal that we cut. We cut our commissions broadly across the Board from 10 to 7 with third-party group intermediaries which I assume what you're talking about. As we have always had that we have certain of our most important relationships where we have incentives systems built in. By the way that was the case back when we were at 10, that's the case the one we're at 7.","So those continue on to make sure that we're driving share in the right way and incenting behavior to get disproportionate share. I have certain players where we think it's really incremental business that our sales team maybe has less access to.","So I would say that that sort of business as usual as we've done it. I'm obviously not going to get into individual deals here whatever.","Smedes Rose","But you're not rolling back that initial\u2026?","Chris Nassetta","No. Let me make perfectly clear, we are not rolling that back. We are 100% committed to the change we made.","Smedes Rose","I just wanted to ask you, so I mean it looks like the U.S., there's increasing evidence of the U.S. development cycle, it potentially peaks and starts to edge down. We talked about this before but it's always interesting to hear your thoughts on anything you're hearing from developers on terms of lending or access to capital or just lowered return expectations as overall cost - the cost environment continues to move up?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, there's nothing really new on that front. I mean I think that over the course of the past year or frankly in the financing cycle over the course of the past year so you've seen lenders on the margin get a little bit capital, get a little bit tighter and a little bit more expensive. Now that said you know for us the good news for us is we've got, we fight way above our weight in terms of the number of deals that we do. Good deals can - still plenty of capital in the world, good deals can still get financed and so we continue to fight above our fair share so that that hasn't been an issue.","And of course construction costs have been going up particularly in the developed world a double-digit rates for a couple of years now and so you've seen broadly an overall slowdown in construction starts in the U.S. which is why you see the prognosticators predicting that supply growth is going to peak but for us we continue to you for high quality projects it's still - they're still readily financeable.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to hand the conference back to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks everybody for joining us today. Good discussion. We'll look forward to talking after the first quarter. Obviously early in the year we'll have a lot more visibility on what's going on out there when we talk next. I appreciate the time today, and we'll catch up soon. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Please note that this call is being recorded today Friday, October 31, 2014 at 10.00 AM Eastern time. I will now turn the call over to your host, Christian Charnaux, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Charnaux, please go ahead.","Christian Charnaux","Thank you, Courtney. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings.","You can find reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our third quarter results and will describe the current operating environment as well as the company's outlook for the remainder of 2014 and into 2015. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019re pleased to report another quarter of great results highlighted by strong top line revenue growth, fee growth and ownership segment performance which led to results above the high end of our guidance on both the top and bottom line. The macro setup for the balance of the year and into next feels great and as a result we've raised our full year RevPAR growth, adjusted EBITDA and our EPS guidance.","In the third quarter, we exceeded our guidance for system-wide comp RevPAR growth of 8.4% on a currency neutral basis posting our highest quarterly growth rate this cycle. Growth was driven by a 4.2% increase in average rate and a 3.1 percentage point increase in occupancy to 79% and was led by the U.S. with quarterly system-wide RevPAR growth of 8.8%. We\u2019re pleased to see continued increases in our global RevPAR index across our brand portfolio increasing 70 basis points year-to-date.","We saw very strong and balanced growth in both transient and group demand in the quarter. Transient revenue grew over 8% system-wide in the quarter. In the Americas, we saw particular strength with system-wide transient growth increasing from 7.7% in Q2 to 8.8% in Q3. Group revenue growth in the quarter was also very strong, up 9% system-wide primarily driven by volume.","Performance was driven by strong results in both the Americas and Europe with the Americas benefiting from solid convention and company meeting volume. We remain on track to deliver mid-to high single-digit group room revenue increases for the full year. We also remain positive on group business going forward as our group revenue position in the Americas system-wide is up in the mid-to-high single digits for the next four quarters.","In the quarter F&B revenue grew 8% and our owned and managed hotels in the Americas on pace with RevPAR growth. We attribute the bulk of the growth to rebounding group business and a more favorable group mix. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $645 million, an increase of over 13% from the third quarter of 2013 and above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 160 basis points.","Let me spend a few minutes on development highlights, we maintained our number one rankings in key categories according to Smith Travel Research including rooms under construction globally, pipeline size and system-wide rooms. Even with the largest base of rooms in the industry, our growing pipeline represents three times our current share of global room supply. In the quarter, we opened 70 hotels or over 12,000 rooms in 177 hotels and nearly 30,000 rooms year-to-date through the third quarter.","As of quarter-end, we had more than 705,000 rooms operating globally and with last week's opening of our first Hilton in Myanmar; we've increased our global presence to 94 countries and territories. We had 559 hotels and 109,000 rooms under construction at quarter-end representing more than 50% of our pipeline.","Our pipeline continues to grow now with 1269 hotels and approximately 215,000 rooms in 74 countries and territories, all in our capital light management franchise segment. For comparability including all deals approved but not yet signed, our pipeline would have been approximately 230,000 rooms. In the third quarter, we approved 123 hotels with over 20,000 rooms for development.","Two weeks ago, we gathered over 1800 of our hotel owners at our Global Owner's conference in Orlando, Florida. At the conference, we formally launched our 12th brand, Canopy by Hilton, an accessible lifestyle brand. We believe this brand will be a game-changer because it appeals to a much wider audience than the traditional lifestyle concepts. Instead of a small sliver of the luxury segment, accessible lifestyle opens up demand more broadly, thus giving us the ability to serve more customers and add meaningfully to our growth over time.","Canopy takes lifestyle out of the dark ages with a light, organic and contemporary look and feel. It's designed to be welcoming and also reflect the local neighborhood flavor and culture where each hotel is located. And we've designed it in such a way that Canopy will be efficient to build or convert, driving a very compelling return on investment for our owners. We launched Canopy with 11 signed deals from a select group of owners with hotels in key urban neighborhoods and vibrant secondary markets including Portland, San Diego, London, Nashville, Savannah, Indianapolis, Washington, DC and Miami.","We also have another 15 Canopies in various stages of discussion. Third party capital will drive Canopy's growth just like it does for all of our brands. In our view, industry leading brands and revenue engines that resonate with customers and provide attractive returns to owners should not require meaningful amounts of our capital to either launch or grow.","We also continue to have extraordinary developer interest in Curio, our recently launched collection of unique 4 to 5 Star hotels. We\u2019re in discussions on more than 90 properties and we've already opened 3 properties totaling over 2800 rooms since the brand launched in June including the SLS Las Vegas Hotel & Casino, the Highland in Dallas and as of yesterday the Diplomat in Hollywood, Florida. In total, Curio plans to open five hotels totaling almost 3200 rooms by year-end.","We believe that new brands such as Curio and Canopy help further our goal to serve any customer, anywhere in the world for any lodging need they have. By doing so, we drive more customer loyalty, higher market share premiums, better returns for our hotel owners and that in turn drives faster net unit growth that should ultimately drive premium returns for our shareholders. We can also serve more customers by intelligently deploying our existing brands in different regions around the world and optimizing those brands for local markets. For example, we believe that having a full portfolio of brands with hotels for every type of guest travel need will be as crucial in China as it is in the developed markets.","As result, we've recently launched our Hilton Garden Inn and Embassy brands in China and just yesterday, we announced plans to launch the Hampton brand in China. We plan to leverage the expertise of a new partner, Plateno Hotels Group, under an exclusive license agreement to develop the mid-scale 3 to 3.5 star hotel market in China with the Hampton brand.","The intent of this agreement is to deliver over 400 hotels with the first expected to open by the end of next year. We\u2019re thrilled to partner with Plateno, a proven hospitality leader in China, operating over 3000 hotels in 300 cities across China under five brands including the highly successful 7 Days Inn brand. With over 80 million members, Plateno's loyalty program will serve as an important source of guests for Hampton in China and also provide Hilton an opportunity to link these consumers to Hilton HHonors and our full portfolio of brands.","The partnership is a win-win for both companies where both sides will be able to leverage their considerable talents to make Hampton by Hilton in China a great success. Simply stated, we expect that this agreement will allow us to accelerate our efforts to gain broad geographic end chain-scale distribution in China enabling us to access a large, growing customer base for both in-country and outbound business and all on a capital light basis.","We are also serving more guests than ever in our luxury brands with over 78 Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels open or in the pipeline. We expect this momentum in luxury to continue particularly with the sale and redevelopment of the Waldorf Astoria New York announced earlier this month. We believe the announced deal is a home run for both our partner Anbang and for us and we\u2019re on track to close the transaction as previously disclosed.","We intend to unlock the significant embedded value in the Waldorf Astoria by using sale proceeds to acquire additional U.S. hotels in a like-kind exchange. We\u2019re making great progress identifying specific properties and are very confident in our ability to complete the exchange. The hotel will remain in our system beyond all of our lifetimes as it will continue to operate the property under a 100 year management agreement. The property will also undergo a major renovation funded by our partner that will restore the property to its historic grandeur, making it a true flagship for the Waldorf Astoria brand.","Now let me update you on the outlook for the remainder of the year and provide some preliminary guidance for 2015. Overall, we remain very optimistic about fundamentals, especially as it relates to the U.S., which has remained a source of relative strength. In the U.S., we expect fundamentals to remain particularly healthy as economic growth and an improving job landscape continue to drive strong demand trends and supply growth remains muted.","We\u2019re maintaining our high single-digit RevPAR growth expectations in the U.S. for 2014. For the Americas region outside the U.S., we also still expect high single-digit RevPAR growth for the full year 2014 as strength in Mexico offsets a weakening Brazil.","Overall performance in Europe continues to be strong. We expect positive momentum in Western and Southern Europe to continue with lingering softness in France. Uncertainty in Russia and the Ukraine will likely weigh on Eastern European results through the remainder of the year. Overall, we maintain our mid-single digit European RevPAR growth forecast for the full year 2014.","Middle East Africa region is recovering nicely overcoming uncertainty surrounding the situation in Syria and Iraq. We expect strength in Egypt to continue due to easy comparisons and what we hope is the beginning of a sustained recovery. We think RevPAR performance in the region will be up in the mid-single digits as tailwinds from Egypt and Saudi Arabia offset headwinds in other parts of the region.","Finally in Asia-Pacific, our expectations remain consistent with what we outlined in August. We continue to anticipate mid-single digit RevPAR growth in the region for 2014. We expect growth in Japan to remain strong, although tempered by new consumption taxes and performance in China to remain steady. Additionally, we think the uptick in trends in both India and Indonesia will continue, although challenges in Thailand will likely remain a regional drag.","Given our strong Q3 performance and continued solid fundamentals, we\u2019re raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance $30 million at the midpoint to $2.47 billion to $2.49 billion with our new midpoint above the upper end of our previous range. We\u2019re also raising our system-wide RevPAR growth guidance for the year to 6% to 7% and our diluted earnings per share guidance range for the year to $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect net unit growth of 35,000 to 40,000 rooms or a 5.5% to 6.5% increase in managed and franchise rooms.","Looking forward to next year, we continue to feel great about the fundamentals and the performance we can drive with our industry leading brands and demand generation capabilities. As a result, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase 5% to 7%. We also think our strong development pipeline will support unit growth acceleration in 2015. This should translate into global net-rooms growth of approximately 40,000 to 45,000 rooms or 6% to 7% increase in managed and franchise rooms.","Finishing up, we obviously feel really good about the performance this quarter and about the setup in terms of fundamentals of the business for the rest of the year and into next. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Kevin Jacobs to get into a little bit more detail on the quarter.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our results for the third quarter which significantly beat our expectations. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.19, ahead of our guidance range of $0.15 to $0.17, driven by our system-wide RevPAR and unit growth performance. Total management and franchise fees were $383 million in the quarter, an increase of 16% over the third quarter of 2013, driven by both new unit and top line growth.","We saw strong growth in both our base and incentive management fees. Incentive management fees were driven by increases in participation rates and growth outside the United States where those fees typically do not stand behind an owner's priority return and where we derive about 75% of our total fees. Adjusting for a $5 million reclassification from base to incentive fees made in the third quarter for a small number of hotels, base fees grew 14% and incentive fees grew 21% in the quarter.","On a year-to-date basis, which is not impacted by the adjustment just described, base-fee growth was 12% and incentive-fee growth was 24%. Given the strength to date and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our comparable management and franchise fee growth estimates by 200 basis points to 13% to 15%. In our ownership segment, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $260 million.","Adjusted for a non-comp increase in affiliate fees, ownership-adjusted EBITDA was 16% higher year-over-year and this performance was driven by RevPAR growth for the segment of 7.3% and strong margin growth at owned hotels globally which grew over 160 basis points.","Our timeshare adjusted EBITDA of $78 million in the quarter was 9% lower than prior year. This was primarily driven by unfavorable revenue recognition timing. Segment EBITDA is up 13% year-to-date compared to last year and we continue to see our full year timeshare segment adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $315 million to $330 million. In addition to recently announced timeshare projects at Hilton Hawaiian Village and Hilton New York, we recently signed a sales and marketing agreement with a third party for our first timeshare project in Maui, which will consist of over 20,000 intervals and is expected to begin sales in 2016.","In total, our inventory now includes over 130,000 intervals, or about six years of inventory at our current sales pace. That is a year-over-year increase in inventory of 58%, over 80% of which is capital light. Our corporate expense and other segment was $76 million in the quarter compared to $73 million during the prior year. We continue to expect growth for the segment of 3% to 5% for the full year.","Our regional results were marked by strong growth in the Americas, ongoing recovery in Europe, stable growth in the Asia-Pacific market and improvement in the Middle East and Africa region, which benefited from solid performance in Egypt and Saudi Arabia given easier year-over-year comparisons as Chris described. RevPAR growth in the U.S. accelerated in Q3 increasing 8.8% with 55% of that growth driven by rate. While favorable supply-demand dynamics supported solid industry fundamentals we believe our chain scale diversity together with our brand strength contributed to our outperformance.","RevPAR at our U.S. owned hotels rose 9.5% in the quarter driven by strong group performance in San Francisco, New Orleans and Chicago. Furthermore, we saw results in Washington, DC up meaningfully mostly due to an uptick in leisure activity and company meetings. Results in the Americas outside the U.S. were strong with RevPAR up 8.3% as our hotels in Brazil benefited from World Cup gains. In July for instance, ADR in Brazil increased over 70%. Puerto Rico was also helped by strong transient demand.","In Asia-Pacific, RevPAR grew 3.4% boosted by solid increases in greater China which was up 7% in the quarter. RevPAR growth in Guangzhou was up nearly 18% while Shanghai rose 11% and Hong Kong rose 10% despite the recent protests. Fundamentals in Japan and Korea remained solid although growth was tempered by a typhoon and softening trade conditions respectively. Political unrest in Thailand continued to weigh on results for the region.","In Europe, fundamentals continued to rebound. Overall occupancy rose 250 basis points while average daily rate increased 3.3%, resulting in a 6.6% RevPAR gain for our European portfolio above the 5.2% gain we experienced in the first half of the year. Our Southern and Mediterranean hotels continued to outperform with Greece and Portugal posting particularly healthy demand during the summer season. Northern and central Europe posted meaningful games as strong event calendars aided German and UK regional hotel performance.","Our owned and operated hotels in Eastern Europe were virtually flat as weakness stemming from geopolitical conflicts offset gains from a strong Middle East travel season. As expected, economic uncertainty weighed on hotels in France. Lastly, Middle East and Africa RevPAR rebounded up 15.5% in Q3 versus a 2% decline in the first half of 2014.","The growth was driven entirely by occupancy gains and as noted earlier, was largely the result of good performance in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $831 million, including $288 million of restricted cash and had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolving credit facility.","We continue to work towards our objective of achieving investment grade status by using substantially all of our free cash flow to repay debt and in turn, build equity value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we made voluntary prepayment of $250 million on our term loan with an additional payment of $100 million in October which brought our total voluntary debt prepayments to $800 million year-to-date. As a result of our continued strong performance, we\u2019re again increasing our expected term loan debt prepayment range by $100 million at the low end to $900 million to $1 billion for the full year.","Finally let's turn to our outlook for 2014 for the full year. As Chris mentioned, we\u2019re raising our system-wide RevPAR guidance to between 6% and 7% on a comp currency neutral basis. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 5% and 6% on the same basis.","We\u2019re increasing our guidance for diluted EPS adjusted for special items to between $0.69 and $0.71 for the full year and for adjusted EBITDA. We are expecting a range of between $2.47 billion and $2.49 billion. Capital spending, excluding timeshare inventory, is expected to total approximately $350 million including about $250 million to $260 million in hotel CapEx which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue.","For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 6% and 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $630 million and $650 million and diluted EPS of $0.16 to $0.18. Further detail on our third quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have. So, that we may speak to as many as you possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Courtney, can we have our first question, please?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays","Regarding the Waldorf cell the sale of the Waldorf and attended when exchange, I'm just wondering what type of hotel assets are you looking to buy with the proceeds? Are you focused point domestic and International, are you focused on five hotels that are currently put in branded, would you consider buying other hotels and converting them? And then what's your view on buying hotels that may need significant CapEx?","Chris Nassetta","We have been hard at work on the 1031 and since we announced it but honestly before we announced it, while we couldn't be out actively in the market prior to the announcement we were tracking everything that was available very closely and have now been very, very actively engaged in the markets.","I think the first of all, simply stated to do the Tiffany what it all has to be domestic U.S. assets in order to qualify as a 1031 so it will not be any components of International. And I think it terms of the types of assets it wouldn't surprise you to know that we are looking at institutional grade assets in the best urban and Resort destinations. We\u2019re looking at large single assets and some portfolios that would be in those types of locations.","Generally, it is not exclusively in the upper upscale and above so upper upscale in luxury segments of the business and a mixture of assets that are pre-existing and our portfolio within our poor photo brands today in those that are not with the objective ideally been to have a blend of those things so that as we put this money to work reported to working great assets and great markets and do it at a great price to create \u2013 to firm up the very significant arbitrage between what we\u2019re selling for and what we are buying for to the extent we can do all those things and grow the system that's a very positive thing so that is what we are trying to accomplish.","As I said we\u2019re making very good progress. We are very confident in getting it done probably give the timeframes over the next 60 to 90 days really probably the next 60 days will be giving you a more specific detail on what assets markets, etcetera.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays","Then just as a follow-up on your development pipeline outside of the U.S., I'm just wondering you guys sound very bullish and how have internationals and trending this year versus your expectations. And sure you've heard some of the comments that comment that you're peers at made on similar calls and specifically some of them have talked about seen some developers and China having financial difficulties, wondering why that shouldn't be a concern for us?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, the good news story \u2013 the reason we\u2019re optimistic is what we've been talking about frankly as part of the IPO and since is the objective we have from a development strategy point of view and a brand strategy point in view is to win everywhere meaning it is a big world, things ebb and flow and we feel like if we have the right brand both existing and we launch the right brands and we adapt those brands intelligently for different market conditions that we can continue to grow in good times and bad and that growth may ebb and flow and be higher or lower in various pieces around the world, but nonetheless we can continue to grow which is why only is our pipeline growing but you see in our preliminary guidance for net unit growth next year that we\u2019re stepping up our expectations of new unit openings.","So we are still very, very confident in our ability to do that. We\u2019re continuing to see healthy growth really in all regions of the world. We have had I think good strategies in Europe where we needed to that was more focused early on for value proposition limited service and conversion and in China I would say we just opened our 50th hotel. We have 150 hotels in the pipeline I know others have commented it, some of the progress has slowed.","I think that's right. We are over 70% of our 150 hotels in the pipeline in China are under construction, so I'm confident that those hotels are going to open.","Might take a little bit longer so I think there's no question things have slowed a bit in China but what's really happening in China in my opinion is something that frankly we've been talking about for the last couple years which is the complexion of what's going to happen there is going to change. That like other parts of the world, China what is going to get developed is going to change and it's going to be changing based on overall demand patterns and overall demand patterns suggest that the greatest demand is going to be in the midmarket.","Reality is that big international companies that have captured the high end pretty well and the local companies like Plateno and 7 Days have captured the low end and we think that there is a huge opportunity in the midmarket both because nobody has really captured the flag so to speak but also that's where the greatest amount of demand is going to be.","And so it's a great example of how we\u2019re adapting, this year alone without even the launch of Hampton, just with Garden Inn 30% of the deals that we have signed year-to-date which is about 6600 \u2013 6700 rooms in China which is back in consistent with last year but what's different about it is that 30% of its limited service and that's just Garden Inn.","Now with the Hampton launch in and our relationship with Plateno, I think what you're going to see is tremendous opportunity for an uptick over time in the volume of what we're doing in China. I just think the complexion of it's going to be different and it is going to be reflective of what I think the bulk of the demand growth is going to be in that market. So that's a long winded but the point of it is really trying to be very strategic about the deployment of our brands around the world, right brands at the right time in the right markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan","A couple quick questions on your 2015 outlook. One, of your 40,000 to 45,000 net-rooms growth how is that split between manage and franchise room? How is that split between U.S. and International? And then my follow-up is, a couple of quarters ago Chris, you had mentioned that you expect incentive management fees to grow next year, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% plus. Is that still a fair view or conservative view given what is presumably a more rate driven RevPAR growth next year? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Yes, Joe, I think on the first question it's 60:40 probably, probably 60% international openings, 55%, 60% the rest of U.S. next year and about the same management franchise. It is going to be probably five ticks off of an even split, one way or another and IMF, you know year-to-date we\u2019re obviously doing really well. We do think that as we've been saying IMF is going to continue to tick up. So we obviously have not given it, we\u2019re not giving guidance on segments or parts of segments from and EBITDA point of view at this call because we are in the budget process. I do expect that trends on IMF to continue to move upward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to ask about RevPAR growth and kind of the composition across some of the chains scales. This year we've seen a big rebound particularly in a second half of this year and some of the limited service a brand really outperforming, you guys are obviously very well-positioned for that. Can you help us think about the outlook for next year and some of the drivers that you think about the higher end parts of the chain scale versus what you are seeing and what you think is driving some of the outperformance and limited service?","Chris Nassetta","We have seen the limited service franchise growth particularly in July and August where we\u2019re leading the charge and we\u2019re quite strong. I think that has had to do with the fact that transient has been so strong. And I think in a number of those cases it's been sort of limited service has been catching up. I think as you look at \u2013 I think as we think about next year's growth I think it is going to be more balanced. I do have every expectation that those transient group are going to both remain very strong, but I would reason to guess that you are going to see a more balancing effect as the group business continues to pick up momentum and that's going to have a more dramatic impact on upscale to particular upper upscale that I think will drive greater growth there than you\u2019ve seen this year.","Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow-up would just be back to the unit growth. You talk about some of the mix in the portfolio there but just curious on what you\u2019re hearing from developers as it relates to \u2013 is the interest pretty good for your brand it's coming from existing owners or is that coming from new developers or kind of what are you hearing right now from the development community because you guys are obviously very active there?","Chris Nassetta","I think what we\u2019re hearing from the development community, it's little bit different as you travel around the world, the world is a big place. But I think it's generally quite positive. The mix of what we\u2019re doing if you think about it sort of U.S. and everything else and the U.S. the majority of the deals we\u2019re doing are with existing developers even with our new brands which is not surprising I would say, it's 75% plus or minus the last number I saw with existing owners which we love, I think it is reflective of the fact that they like our brands and our engines and we are driving great results by having very high market share.","If you go to the rest the world by definition because it's a less mature business for us, those ratios aren't quite as high. I think it doesn't quite flip around but the majority of the deals we\u2019re doing outside the U.S. are with new partners which is great just because we don't have as big a base out there and what I'm hearing and \u2013 I would say, again the world is a big place but generally the development community is quite positive. I would say in the U.S. incrementally more positive.","The U.S. fundamentals continue to tick up. The economy is getting a bit better and so I think the development community is feeling better. I think in Europe again more recently I think there is a view that European economy is sort of stabilizing may be getting decent foundation to start the show a little bit more growth, not terribly robust growth but a little bit more growth.","So I would say most recently developers have been getting more optimistic, not less. Middle East has remained optimistic is what I would say. Non-U.S., Americas I would say fairly consistently \u2013 consistent and remaining optimistic and Asia-Pacific is a big place, but broadly I would say there continues to be nice optimism there. As I said it's changing in different parts of the world. I think probably China being the most dramatic in my opinion, in a good way for us because I think we think it's the right thing to do. We've anticipated it. We've been working on this Plateno thing for the better part of a year and figuring out the limited service space with an intense focus for the last couple of years, but long winded answer but I would say from a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year point to view I would say incrementally that development community if I average the world is slightly more upbeat.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Two questions. First, just on the incentive fees which were strong, just a little bit more detail. Are more hotels now paying in the U.S. because they've met owners priority and is there some point where those will click on more? Or is it that you are seeing incentive fees go up because you are doing more international managed properties?","Chris Nassetta","It is more the latter than the former. If you look at the breakdown of our incentive management fees 75% of it is I think as Kevin said is international. If you look at the components of growth incentive management fees, 65% of the growth in the quarter was international so the majority of that and you know those do not generally sit behind owner return.","So we had nice growth in U.S., don\u2019t get me wrong, 35% of the overall incentive management fee growth was U.S. participations have moved up in the U.S., probably by about 10 points but it's still the minority of the growth. If you look at sort of what's organic growth, same-store growth versus new unit growth about 65% of it is coming from same-store. Again predominately international, strong International hotels and results [ph] in about 35% of it is coming from the new units almost all of which would be international in terms of new units that have instead of management fee contracts because most of the growth at that moment in the U.S. is franchise growth and limited service which wouldn't have incentive management fee contracts.","Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Chris, just to be clear, is there any point where there is a bogey they hit and they start to click on in a more material way and then just one secondary question which is the Hilton brand itself just lagged a little bit in RevPAR growth across all of your brands. Is it more international and that's what weighed that down? Is it harder to drive rate in the Hilton brand at this point? I mean still up 7.4% terrific number, but a little bit different from the rest of the--","Chris Nassetta","I think it was international assets and a couple in the lease portfolio in particular. I don't think there's anything anomalous to think about it, I think it's just this quarter leased.","Kevin Jacobs","There is more core, larger core Hilton's that are leased in some of the parts of the world where there is stuff going on and I don't think it is much more than that.","Chris Nassetta","In terms of the incentive management fees I think, I view it as a real positive which is again the bulk of our IMF and thus the bulk of our growth is in the international state. It's a linear equation in the sense that we don't sit behind perhaps, so as the markets around the world get stronger and we see profitability grow we get to share in our fair share of it without stepping up over the cliff.","I mean we\u2019re showing very good healthy growth year-to-date 24% IMF growth. We think we feel pretty good about that. We expect to have about 20% for the full year and as we have said many times we do think over time as we both see operating performance continue to improve around the world and we add a lot of new units with these types of contracts outside the U.S. that you are going to continue to see the IMF growth rate move up. But there are some to be specific in the U.S. where we don't have participation where the switch will go on but the U.S. is in aggregate only 25% of our overall incentive management fees.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura","Just a quick question on the gains that you are still seeing in occupancy at this point and the cycle, they are surprisingly strong and Chris, if you could talk about how much more do you think is realistic to expect there and are we at the point where your managers can really start driving rate?","Chris Nassetta","That's a great question and we've spent a lot of time on it over the last year or so. I think obviously this year we would have, going into the year probably thought more of our growth would be in the form of rate than it has been. And I view it as a real positive that it's not in terms of sort of a telltale sign of where we\u2019re in the cycle meaning mid-cycle with a long runway in front of us.","And what's really happening is while we are driving rate, we\u2019re \u2013 and while we are above prior high-level occupancy marks we\u2019re continuing to just get smarter about the revenue management side of the business. I think as an industry but obviously I'm partial to us. I think we've been doing a good job and what that really has meant \u2013 I mean there are a lot of things but it's really looking at weekends particularly and off peak times.","I think we've just gotten much, much better about driving business on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and if you think about it we always have capacity in most of our hotels because the bulk of our hotels are driven by the business side. So you always on Friday, Saturday, Sunday have capacity and if you can fill it even though you\u2019re driving more occupancy in a rate you want to take it all day long at a reasonable rate because you\u2019re just driving incremental profitability.","And that's what's been happening, if I look at our occupancy numbers on weekends they've been moving up. If I look at our market share on weekends it's been moving up and that's what is sort of taking us over the prior peaks of occupancy that people have gotten used to thinking about.","So I think it's in part because we've done a good job. I think it's sort of the new norm and I don't think we are done. I think next year we\u2019re in the middle of budget season. So I don't have the answer in front of me but I can tell you directionally we\u2019re definitely going to see more rate growth than occupancy \u2013 the mix is going to be more rate than occupancy then you saw this year. When we finish this year it's probably going to be 55 \u2013 45 because of a phenomenon that I described. Again that's all on driving profitability and great for the business, I don't think it's something to worry about. I think it's something to revel in. Next year you'll see more of it but we will have some more occupancy because I still think there's more to do by being intelligent about weekends and sort of off peak times and how we revenue manage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob LaFleur with JMP. Your line is open.","Bob LaFleur \u2013 JMP","A couple questions on the Waldorf transaction. As you looking to deploy number $2 billion obviously you're very a willing buyer. How do you manage your price discipline? What are you seeing in terms of cap rates or multiples for assets out there? And then a second Waldorf question unrelated, how disruptive are renovation do anticipate from the project after the new owners takeover? Are you going to close the hotel and start from scratch? Are you going to do in phases? Just give us a little bit of information on the if you don't mind?","Kevin Jacobs","Sure, I will give you what I can in terms of what we know at the moment. So you\u2019re right $2 billion is a lot of money to put out there. Obviously I spend a lot of years of my life in that side of the business, so I think it's something we\u2019re comfortable doing. I think yes, we\u2019re willing buyer but thankfully we are part of the stage in the cycle where there are plenty of willing sellers.","We are relatively unique and that we have $2 billion of cash that is going to get placed not, everybody is sitting around with $2 billion let alone all in cash. The way the 1031 rules work is you probably know we have a period of time after closing which to identify properties. We can identify two times the amount so we can identify $4 billion of properties to ultimately acquire half of that. That gives us the ability to put a lot in the funnel and decide based on quality and pricing and other considerations what we want to do. From a multiples point of view I will comment when we've done something but I think you can see sort of where things have been trading, that have occurred this year in the REIT world or private equity world and I think you can get a pretty good beat on where multiples are. In the end we sold the Waldorf at 32 times and I think we view the buy at something much closer to our own multiple which I think is \u2013 you can do the math, creates a huge arbitrage, meaning we\u2019re going to take what was $61 million of EBITDA that the Waldorf reduced trailing 12 and it's going to turn into \u2013 I will let you do the math, it's going to turn into a lot more EBITDA than that if we do our job well and we fully intend to do so.","Chris Nassetta","In terms of renovation, it's unclear, we did a lot of work that we've talked about some of that on prior calls to understand the various options on how to redevelopment Waldorf. Anbang is a relationship that actually we've been building over the last year but the relationship in terms of their acquisition of the Waldorf was relatively recent and obviously we are all very busy getting the transaction negotiated. We have now entered the process with Anbang of sharing all of the various work that we've done in a more detailed way and I would say we will probably take the next six to nine months with them to review those alternatives that we've come up with and make sure we've sort of figured out what thoughts they have before we layout the exact plan for the Waldorf. So there is a lot of work being done but it's going to take, it's a major investment there making to buy it, it's another very significant investment, they are going to make to renovate. We all want to get it right so we\u2019re going to spend the next six months or so making sure we pin it down properly.","Bob LaFleur \u2013 JMP","Okay and I'm going to count this is one question and then ask a follow-up, how effective did your system at capturing demand that you're not able to accommodate at a customer's first choice? Because as we talked about keep occupancies and lots (indiscernible) of sellouts, you\u2019re are going to have customers that are looking to book in your hotels that cannot get into the first (indiscernible), how effectively you channel them through the rest of your system to capture them?","Chris Nassetta","I think we do a very good job. I always think we can do better, so our cross sell capabilities I think are quite good. I'm not sure anybody has any better but it is one of the things that I and we have focused on making sure that we get even better at that, that can also help drive system wide occupancy and ultimately system-wide RevPAR growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is open","Joel Simkins \u2013 Credit Suisse","In terms of your discussions with the rating agencies I just wanted to find out sort of how they are tracking and sort of with that in mind as you guys continue to delever. How do you think you can ultimately balance getting to low investment-grade with also starting to think about capital return strategy?","Kevin Jacobs","Moody's has just upgraded us one notch recently. So you can look at the press release they put out and the way we think about it is, we still think that 3 to 4 times is the right target leverage for the company. We think that will get us to investment grade. You could see points in cycle where they have a different view of what investment grade means if we get to three times leverage and we are not exactly investment grade we will evaluate it at that time. So we've been pretty consistent that that's our target and once we reach our target we won't overcook it and we will start thinking about the traditional forms of capital return.","Joel Simkins \u2013 Credit Suisse","Sure and then I'm just following up on the Waldorf obviously that was a very significant transaction, certainly highlights the other folks out there, willing to pay for iconic properties. With that in mind, I guess you still own some pretty significant big box hotels. Are you guys willing sellers if someone comes around for the right asset, the right price? Or are you going to continue to hold onto the big eight assets?","Chris Nassetta","I think as it relates to the big eight for the moment we\u2019re going to hold onto those. I don't see anything like a Waldorf transaction in the offering. As we have talked about many times we\u2019re not in love with the real estate for the sake of feeling like we have to own it. We\u2019re really just trying to maximize value for the whole shareholder base.","At the moment the Waldorf deal made a lot of sense for the reasons, I think I've articulated and that are obvious by the virtue of the math. I think the way to maximize the value of that other real estate at the moment given the condition specific to those assets is to keep inside the company.","If at any point we think that is not the case we will be the first ones to want to do something about it as I'm pretty consistent saying likely option for that would be to do some sort of structured transaction to make sure that we\u2019ve tax efficiency. The Waldorf, if we\u2019re getting tax efficiency with a 1031. As was pointed out it's a lot of money to place, in theory, we\u2019re accomplishing a lot of objectives including getting a massive reinvestment done without the use of our capital. That was sort of unique in the big eight portfolio.","So I think the way to think about the real estate for us on a go forward basis and the bulk of those big eight is, if there was a time at which it made sense to bifurcate the business and that that would drive a greater value for the shareholder base we would be interested in doing that. As we look at it as I\u2019ve said in the last couple of calls and we constantly are looking at this we just don't think that's the case at the moment. Net of cost break etcetera, we think that value equation is to keep the rest of it together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust","Two questions for you. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about six years of inventory in the timeshare business. How do you fill about \u2013 what is the right amount when I think about other companies it's typically you have 2 to 4 years, six seems definitely at the high end there. And then secondly public comments you care to make about the I think it's the United Nations enquiring about the Waldorf sale?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I will take them one at a time. On the six years of inventory you\u2019re right, I mean that's more significant than what you would find with most of our competition and we like that. It makes us feel good that in a business that we are really converting to being heavily capital-light much like no tell a business that we've got a lot of running room which we think is testament to the strength of the brand and the testament to the business model which is to say by the virtue the fact we can build six years of inventory very quickly. This is a very sustainable business and business model.","I think that the right range is generally somewhere in the 4 to 6 years, that\u2019s how we would think about it. I think we are at the upper end of that. The higher the better, right. But 4 to 6 years is how we would look at that.","As it relates to the inquiry on the Waldorf, I don't want to get into a lot of detail other than to say we actually went to the U.S. government as unilaterally as part of the announcement of the deal. We have had discussions which have been informal discussions and I'm confident as I said in my prepared remarks it will be able to close the transaction and the timeframes that have been previously disclosed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.","Robin Farley \u2013 UBS","Looking at the results RevPar growth was so strong. It was 150 \u2013 200 basis points higher growth rate than you've had the last seven or eight quarters. But I'm just curious on the flow-through of the growth profit margin with that 150 to 200 basis points higher RevPAR, was that kind of the same level of growth profit margin growth. So just wondering if there's anything going on property level expenses or that kind of thing that maybe happened in the quarter?","Kevin Jacobs","No. I don't think so. I mean we actually tracked from a margin point \u2013 I mean there is always sort of nuances of what goes on both property and enterprise wide quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year comp issues that get complicated but I won't try and handle in a call and the limited time I have other than to say we felt great about the margins, actually, from a standpoint of how we came out at the property level and sort of the managed portfolio and how that translated into enterprise wide margin growth at 160 bps and 210 bps year-to-date. It all tracked frankly above what our expectations were. So I think best way to look at is where we are in margins year-to-date and where we\u2019re in terms of our forecast for the year versus our initial that guidance and expectations and I think in all those regards we\u2019re sort of trending a bit better than we thought.","Robin Farley \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then for the Canopy brand, are those 11 new builds or conversions and how do you expect over the longer term that that brand will be more likely to be developed?","Chris Nassetta","It is a mix of both. Interestingly, I think over time you will have a pretty even split. I would even guess the majority will be conversions or adaptive reuse, maybe conversions of independent hotels, it may be conversions of older office buildings or buildings that have character in a particular location. I would expect the majority would be made up of those types of transactions.","As it turns out in the first 11, majority are actually new build opportunities. But I think that is just you\u2019re dealing with a comp set of 11 hotels. I think it's going to be, as I said in my comments \u2013 what we've tried to do is engineer the DNA of this, so that either new build or conversion are very, very cost efficient to drive obviously brand integrity at the top that drives a lot of revenue but cost efficiency to build and to operate that will drive great owner return. So I think both ways, both new build and conversion it works, but I would think over time majority will be conversion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird. Your line is open.","David Loeb \u2013 Robert W. Baird","I want to beat the dead horse of the Waldorf just a little bit more on the 1031. Strategically, are you thinking about seeding Curio, Canopy or Conrad or Waldorf with the stuff that you buy and are you counting things that you buy and convert into the brand in your assumptions about new unit growth for next year?","Chris Nassetta","The answer is to number one, yes, to the extent we can seed any of our brands. So it's anything in the upper upscale and above so it's all of the ones you've noted plus others. Conrad, Waldorf, Hilton and Canopy and Curio, so anything we can do to increase the distribution of those brands is definitely at the forefront. And we have some opportunities to do that and the deals that are in the funnel that we\u2019re working on \u2013 we also as I said have deals that are already in the system, not surprisingly that are terrific assets and great urban or resort destinations. We\u2019re not counting \u2013 and the nug [ph] as we call it the net unit growth numbers that we gave you, we\u2019re not counting those conversions.","David Loeb \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. So just to follow-up in that kind of an indirect one--","Chris Nassetta","The nug [ph] numbers we\u2019re giving you are really for managed franchise segment, our capital light segment. So this is trading assets within the ownership segment. So the 40 to 45 is pure management franchise.","David Loeb \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. So sort of and a direct follow-up, Blackstone owns a bunch of hotels some of which are on the market. Do any of those like the Boulders or some of the Hilton's or Doubletree's that they own, are those able to be sold unencumbered of brand?","Chris Nassetta","Any of the ones we have with them?","David Loeb \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Yes.","Chris Nassetta","The answer is some are and some are not. Blackstone is probably if not the one of the top two or three owners of hotel real estate in the world and we happen to manage and franchise a bunch of hotels with them. So in terms of our consideration set of deals, Blackstone a number of their assets would definitely be in our funnel.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley","On your 2015 RevPar, can you give us any more color around your expectations for domestic versus international growth? Thanks.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, 5 to 7, I mean in an oversimplified way Thomas, I would say sort of U.S. towards the higher end. The rest of the world may be middle lower end of that range, and that\u2019s how you get to a 5 to 7 range. We said another way, we think U.S. will lead the charge as it is this year. And the rest of the world will be a little bit lighter than U.S., not materially but a little bit.","Thomas Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Similar to commentary from the other companies and then just my follow-up just on Plateno, I found it interesting that it is an exclusive license agreement. How is that typically structured? Do you\u2019ve a lot of those deals? How do you think about doing those kinds of deals versus kind of going alone?","Chris Nassetta","We did not have a lot of them. We have some of them. I mean they take different forms but we do have what I would say sort of multi-asset franchise relationships, which is what this really is. This is a different in the sense I think the volume is going to be bigger than some others but we have some others that are sizable.","And so it is not abnormal other than we think it's going to produce significantly higher results in the terms of the goal of doing 400 hotels. I don't think there's a better partner we spent, honestly the better part of two years, figuring out how we would go about really penetrating the 3 to 3.5 star space given my earlier comments. We think that is mission critical to success in China for a business in China and outbound business coming out of China.","We considered lots of different options, and joint ventures and go it alone and finding a partner and one of this is just finding a good partner \u2013 Plateno, you know we start talking to frankly about year ago. We have been working on this a long time and given their track record and given the relationship we built with that we\u2019ve very high degree of confidence in their ability to execute with us. We've done some amazing things with the design work with what we're going to do in the commercial set up, for what we are going to do with Hampton and I'm a 100% confident that doing it with them is going to accelerate our ability to penetrate the 3 \u2013 3.5 Star versus doing it on our own by multiples.","Operator","Thank you. And with no further questions I would like to turn the conference over for any additional or closing remarks.","Chris Nassetta","Well thanks, everybody. We appreciate the time. We are obviously very happy with the results for the third quarter. We are excited about the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter more importantly, great momentum I think going into next year. Feel great about where we are in this cycle. Appreciate your time and attention today on a Friday and Halloween and look forward to catching up with you after we finish out the year. Take care and have a great weekend.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"10807":["Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Christian Charnaux, you may begin.","Christian Charnaux","Thank you, Leann. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide second quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.

You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and will describe the current operating environment as well as the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Nassetta","Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance. We continue to feel great about the fundamentals, which should continue to support strong performance going forward.","As a result, we've raised our full year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance. Given our confidence in the outlook and the significant deleveraging we've achieved, we are also pleased to commence returning capital to shareholders with the declaration this morning of our first quarterly cash dividend.","Kevin will cover this in more detail later in his remarks, but we intend to grow our dividend over time as earnings grow, and we believe we should be able to initiate these share buyback program next year.","Turning to our performance in the quarter, system-wide comp RevPAR grew 5.2% on a currency-neutral basis. May was somewhat softer than expected largely due to weaker transient business caused by weather in the Southern and Central U.S. and demand declined across oil and gas markets, impacting quarterly RevPAR growth by approximately a 100 basis points.","However, trading growth for the quarter was still relatively strong, up a little over 5% system-wide and strengthened significantly in June continuing into July. Group business was strong in the quarter as system-wide group revenue increased over 6% at our comp owned Americas owned and operated hotels largely during my company meetings that were up over 10% in the quarter, with particular strength in the Chicago, New Orleans and Hawaii markets.","Favorable mix shifts also combined to support ancillary spend with F&B as owned and operating hotels growing 7% in the quarter. Group position continues to track up in the mid-single digits for both the balance of this year, and into 2016. We expect to see a strong second half of the year and group with the fourth quarter outpacing the third quarter largely due to holiday shifts.","Turning to development. Our system continues to both - our system growth continues to both lead the industry and gain in momentum. According to Star, we increased our industry leading position in both pipeline and rooms under entering on the construction in the quarter. We are on track to have a record number of signings this year roughly 90,000 rooms continuing to grow the largest pipeline in our company's history, all with de minimis amounts of our capital and no acquisitions. In the quarter, we opened 82 hotels totaling more than 11,000 rooms bringing our total supply to 4,440 properties and more than 730,000 rooms. With the opening of the Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort and Hilton Garden Inn, Guatemala City earlier this month. We are now present in 97 countries and territories. Including all approved deals our pipeline stands at nearly 265,000 rooms.","As of today, we have 1 million rooms open or under development and expect to be in 100 countries and territories by the end of the year. Net unit growth adds to our ability to serve customers anywhere in the world for any traveling they have, driving significant loyalty to our systems that continue to enhance our industry leading RevPAR index premiums. To serve even more customers, we continue to globally deploy our existing brands and launch new brands like Home2, Curio and Canopy and soon a new midscale brand.","We now have nearly 60 Home2s open with over 225 more in the pipeline. Year-to-date, we have signed or approved nearly 80 new Home2s and continue to build significant momentum with developers. Curio has celebrated its first anniversary with nearly 50 properties and 13,000 rooms open or in various stages of development, and with its first international hotels opening this month in the Caribbean, Europe, and Latin America. We also continue to see tremendous interest from owners in Canopy with over 20 hotels and 3,500 rooms either in the pipeline or within signed letters of intent. We expect in the first Canopy to open in Reykjavik, Iceland, early next year.","We intend to launch our new midscale brand in the first quarter of 2016 largely targeting new customers for our system at a price point below the Hampton brand. We believe the target market is about 40% of U.S. room night demand, demand that our current system largely does not serve. We have already received tremendous interest from our owners on this brand and our goal is to have a system size larger than Hampton over time with next to no capital investment are acquired.","Our portfolio brands from Waldorf to Hampton and soon to include our midscale brand are linked together by our Hilton HHonors program and our enhanced HHonors app is at the center of making our system more rewarding and attractive to guests. Fully integrated into our backend systems, the HHonors app allow guests to check-in and select the room at over 4,100 hotels globally today with straight to room capabilities via a digital key now ruling out its scale with hundreds of hotels expected to offer the service by year-end.","Our award winning HHonors app has been downloaded nearly 5 million times, and nearly one in four HHonors arrivals are using digital check-in and room selection today. Totally nearly 5 million digital check-ins a day and approaching 1 million mobile check-ins per month. Guest\u2019s feedback has been really positive with the HHonors app receiving the highest average Apple store customer rating amongst all hotel apps since its re-launch.","Now let me update you on the outlook for the reminder of the year. Overall, the fundamentals of the cycle remain very solid, and we continue to expect 5% to 7% system-wide RevPAR growth in 2015. In the U.S., we expect 5% to 7% RevPAR growth for the full year supported by favorable supply and demand dynamics and growing group business, particularly in the fourth quarter, although we expect continued pressure from softening European and Japanese inbound travel. Decreases should be mitigated by continued upticks in inbound travel from other markets particularly from China and strong domestic leisure business.","For the Americas region outside the U.S., we anticipate mid single digit RevPAR growth for the full year supported by solid trends in Mexico, Peru and Columbia which should be more - which should more than outlay challenges in Brazil where economic softness continue.","We maintain our mid single digit RevPAR growth expectations for Europe although prolonged challenges in France and Eastern Europe continue to temper our regional performance. Leisure trends remain very strong particularly throughout Spain and Italy as robust international inbound travel in greater local demand drive strong transient business.","For the Middle East, Africa region we forecast low single digit RevPAR growth for the year as decreasing inbound demand from Russia, Germany and Turkey continues to weigh on results in Saudi Arabia and UAE. This inbound weakness should be largely offset by strengthening fundamental and easy comparisons in Egypt.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we continue to expect high single digit RevPAR growth supported by strong fundamentals in Japan, positive momentum in Thailand and solid performance in China. We continue to forecast 6% to 8% RevPAR growth in China for the full year, despite decelerating economic growth due mostly to our favorable market mix and rising market share.","In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance as well as the setup for the remainder of this year and in the next. We also remain very focused first and foremost on creating long term value for shareholders including exploring possible structural options for the company. I know many of you are curious about the potential for time share or real estate spin opportunities, and I can tell you that we continue to explore all options and still plan to give you a full update before the year's out.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for further details on the quarterly results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Kevin.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks Chris, good morning everyone. During the quarter our RevPAR growth of 5.2% was driven by a 3.4% increase in average rate and a 1.3 percentage point increase in occupancy. In actual dollar system line RevPAR per increased 2.9%. RevPAR growth was 5.8% for the first half of the year roughly two-thirds driven by rate.","Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.25 an increase of 19% versus the prior year period and above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was $777 million an increase of 15% year-over-year. Beating the high end of our guidance by approximately $17 million. SP growth significantly outperformed expectations and FX headwinds were lower than expected. We attribute $5 million to $10 million of the beat to timing items that should normalize during the back half of the year.","For the quarter enterprise wide adjusted EBITDA margins were up 320 basis points year-over-year to 41.8%. Management franchise fees were $434 million in the quarter, up 17% over the second quarter of 2014 driven by strong franchise sales, new unit growth and accelerated timing of certain items including change of ownership and termination fees.","We continue to grow fees by increasing effective franchise rates through the second quarter, we have approved the relicensing of over above 275 hotels this year, more than double the pace of last year.","Resulting in a net increase of franchise rates from 4.6% to 5.5% in those hotels or an estimated fee increase of more than $10 million annually. For the fee business overall, we expect growth in the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter to de-accelerate relative to the first half. Again, this is mostly owing to accelerated timing of fees booked earlier in the year than we initially anticipated.","Tougher comparisons to last year and someone high [indiscernible] that benefited in prior year results. The ownership segment opposed to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $318 million, up approximately 9% versus the prior year. Results were driven by robust fundamentals and were boosted by performance in Chicago, Japan, New Orleans and the recently acquired 1031 exchange assets in Florida and San Francisco outperforming there underwriting.","Costs savings, including lower energy prices further feel the segments outperformance and supported margin expansion of 200 basis points. Timeshare adjusted EBITDA was $86 million in the quarter, up 21% versus the prior year period. Performance within line with our expectations and we continue to expect timeshare adjusted EBITDA of $335 million to $315 million - $350 million for full year 2015.","We continue to grow our timeshare supply with fee for service deals that require no capital on our part. Including two recent capital-light deals a condo-to-hotel conversion in Orlando and a new build tower in Myrtle beach. Our current timeshare supply totals nearly 136,000 inner goals or about six years of sales at our current pace with over 83% of those developed by third parties. Finally, our corporate and other segment was $61 million for the quarter, slightly better than expectations.","Moving on to regional results. In the U.S. RevPAR grew 5% year-over-year comparable system wide hotels. As Chris mentioned, results were pressured by severe weather and flooding in key areas of the country, demand declines across key oil markets most notably Houston where RevPAR dropped 5.7% in the quarter as well as by tough year-over-year comparisons.","More broadly, we continue to see solid fundamentals supported by increasing rate and strong leisure transient revenue which was up over 8% in the quarter. Trends in New York improved sequentially aided by both transient and group performance. Inbound travel to the U.S. from Continental Europe declined 1% through June which has impacted gateway cities. However, some markets like San Francisco and Hawaii have seen increased demand from other countries including China and Australia mitigate weaker European travel.","And the Americas outside the U.S., RevPAR grew 6.8% driven primarily by strength in Mexico, Peru and Chile which was somewhat offset by Brazil where performance was hit particularly hard given prolonged economic softness from lower commodity prices. RevPAR in Europe increased 4.6% as solid leisure trends supported by rising inbound travel offset softer group volumes in Germany, Spain and the UK.","Inbound travel from the U.S. to Continental Europe grew 65 year-to-date through June, and strong vacation bookings continue into the third quarter. The Middle East and Africa region posted modest RevPAR growth of 2.5%, despite the sustained recovery in Egypt declining inbound continued to win fundamentals on the Arabian and Peninsula.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR gains of 9.4% were driven by nearly 19% growth in Japan, which benefited from strong transient rates as well as continued improvement in Thailand and strong trends in China. Corporate and leisure demand coupled with market share gains supported over 10% RevPAR growth in Mainland China despite some softness in the country's broader economy.","Turning to capital allocation, we reduced long-term debt by $175 million in the quarter, and prepaid an additional $350 million on our term loan this month, using the net proceeds from the Hilton Sydney sale. This brings total debt reduction year-to-date of $750 million.","As Chris mentioned, we will begin returning capital to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share, payable on September 25, to shareholders of record on August 14. We intend to grow the dividend over time and maintaining a target payout ratio of 30% to 40% of recurring cash flow, which we defined as adjusted EBITDA, less debt service, CapEx, taxes and working capital.","Our goal remains to achieve an investment grade credit rating, which we believe will maximize equity value over the long-term. Going forward, we anticipate returning recurring cash flow in excess of a market dividend to shareholders through a programmatic share buybacks. Based on our anticipated credit profile, we believe this could occur in the second quarter or third quarter next year.","We ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7 times, and expect to end the year below 3.5 times after factoring for dividend payments. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we are maintaining system-wide RevPAR growth guidance of between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Adjusting for the sale of the Hilton Sydney which closed early this month, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $20 million at the mid-point to $2.82 billion to $2.87 billion.","Our full year guidance continues to assume approximately $16 million related to FX impacts for the year. To the third quarter of 2015, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Adjusted EBITDA of between $730 million and $750 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.21 to $0.23. Further detail on our second quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Leann can we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis","Good morning everyone.","Christopher Nassetta","Good morning.","Harry Curtis","Just wanted to ask you a bigger picture question. Investor\u2019s single biggest concern is that the lodging demand and pricing are decelerating that the cycle is over. So I wonder if you could give maybe a bit more 'meat around the bone' that gives you confidence that Hilton can enjoy pricing power in the 5% to 7% range for an extended period that the cycle really has ample room to run?","Harry, I'm happy to do it, I know that prime on everybody's mind particularly given what I've seen volatility in the markets and as others have reported. I think my philosophy on this is quite simple and frankly quite consistent, which is I think we're in a very, very nice part of the cycle. I don't feel any different in that regard than I felt over the last several quarters. I think that is supported not to over simplify it, but I think it is supported by the basic laws of economics, okay. And that is, as I look at the world or I look at the U.S. market which still represents in our large part of - nearly 80% of our EBITDA. We have an economy that is certainly not roaring, but is showing reasonably stable growth with the potential that have a slight uptick in growth. The demand for rooms - the hotel rooms follows very closely, it's on a very high correlation to that.","We are seeing decent demand growth for rooms that is being matched by historically - continuing historically low supply level. So it was less than 1%. We're now clicking a little bit over 1% in 2015. It will go up a little bit from there. Recognizing the 30 year averages 2.5% and by the way in my history of many, many cycle, it is not at the average that you typically run into supply problems, and I think we're long, long way from the average. So, I think if the U.S. economy maintains moderate growth rate based on what we can see from the standpoint of where that pipeline is and what supply growth is going to be. I think you've got several years of running, remember you can feel very good.","Now every quarter can be a little bit different here and there, depending transient things that go on line like, we had go on in May or group - the way groups cycle through, but it should clearly in my opinion support growth, which is what I have been saying very consistently over the last couple of years and for the next couple of years it should clearly support growth in the 5% to 7% range, which is what we have been delivering. If you look at the - break it down by segments, I think it should make you feel good, it makes me feel good. You look at what's going on in transient, you had a little hiccup in May, but related to very specific things, but June has been very strong and strong in the highest rated segments of transient.","Leisure transient is quite strong and then you go to the group side and we gave you some of the stats, that the group pace has been good, the position is good both and the rest of the year and looking out the 2016, quite strong and strong in company meeting which is honestly where you'd really like as much as anywhere to see it, shield that strength and so not only do the [indiscernible] of economics and sort of the macro conditions make me feel good, but when I look at the micro conditions of the various important segments of our business and where they are going and what we see on the books and consumer behavior it makes me feel awfully good.","Last point and I know, just because this is on everybody's mind, so were taking a little bit time on, I know this, my sense is that people are being getting sort of less enthusiastic about the cycle over the last six weeks or eight weeks. It's interesting as I said at this very table, I mean, our board room every Monday morning, and I talked to my whole team around the world including the three president that run our mega regions and I end the week talking to the three of them as well, and I am going to tell you over the last six weeks or eight weeks that they haven't been - by region and I now saying amongst all of them they haven't been getting slightly more negative or neutral, they began slightly more positive in their views of what's going on in our three big mega regions. So, okay that's anecdotal, but I mean, just sort of the atmospherics of what we see in real hard data and the atmosphere, the data that we see, hard data makes you feel good, but the atmosphere, I should say around just how we [indiscernible] our teams feels around the world about where things are going is quite positive as well.","So, I think, I will declare from my and our point of view, we think the cycle is alive and well, we're very confident in being able to do deliver what we were suggesting to you that we're going to deliver this year, and we think that the good times continue.","Harry Curtis","That takes care of it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joseph Greff","Good morning everybody, and thank you...","Christopher Nassetta","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Greff","...and thanks for the prospectus, Chris. Kevin when you're looking at the 3Q guidance, the 4.5% to 6.5% which I think is probably reassuring relative to what others have talked about to the 3Q. On a currency adjusted basis, how do you see that? And then what's the assumption for the U.S. properties in that one - 6.5...","Kevin Jacobs","The 4.5% to 6.5% I assume - mean that the 4.5% to 6.5% is FX neutral, so what it would be at actual rates. I think I would be a 0.2% to lower than that at actual rates. And then, the U.S. is consistent with that outlook.","Joseph Greff","Got it. And then which in the last couple of quarters we've seen relatively stronger growth?","Christopher Nassetta","And Joe that - and Joe we covered it sort of indirectly, that the reason is they have that pick down really as everything to do with sort of the holiday calendar in - in the third quarter. With just the effect of the calendar is shifting some business is just waiting fourth quarter, particularly on the group side more than the third quarter, the full second half of the year looks [indiscernible] bit more waiting in fourth quarter versus and third quarter, and so that half a point is the reflection of that.","Joseph Greff","So would you expect the second half U.S. to be consistent with the growth that you saw in the first half?","Christopher Nassetta","Generally, yes.","Joseph Greff","Great. That's it from me. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Smedes Rose","Hi thanks. I guess just along the same lines here, sort of - so in order to achieve the higher end of your RevPAR growth for the year, we're going to need to see RevPAR kind of pick up at a pretty healthy pace through the second half, and I know you have your range there. But if you had to kind of lean one way or the other, would you be kind of towards the higher or kind of mid part of that range?","Christopher Nassetta","Well, I'd say couple things. I think you're doing the math, right, so yes, it does imply a pickup and I do think that what you will see I think you will see sequentially the third quarter RevPAR numbers be higher than second quarter, and I think the fourth quarter at least as we look at our forecast, particularly, given that really stronger base will be higher than the third quarter. I would say for the full year [indiscernible] gave you a range, I'd probably direct it to the middleish of the range.","Smedes Rose","And then just, Kevin just to clarify in the management and fee income for the quarter, you said, there were $5 million to $10 million of sort of for lack of a better word, one-time items in there...","Kevin Jacobs","Yes.","Smedes Rose","...is that all in that line? Okay.","Kevin Jacobs","That's right.","Smedes Rose","Even if you adjust for those, it seems like growth in the second quarter was a little above the high-end of your range, and I am just wondering through the back half for the year, you just sort of being trying to be conservative there or is there something that would kind of slowdown that pace of growth?","Kevin Jacobs","No, I think there is couple of things have planned with me, one is the timing as you mentioned, I mean there is something that materialized, earlier in the year then we thought and then in the fourth quarter last year, we had some one-time items that created a little bit tougher comps on the growth rate basis.","Smedes Rose","Okay. Can you quantify what the amount loss in that fourth quarter last year, or?","Kevin Jacobs","No. We could take you through some of the modeling offline, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't one against to come out.","Smedes Rose","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclay. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thank you. Just switching gears for a moment to your pipeline. Chris, just was your new unit openings and your development pipelines seems to be efficiently waited source of the U.S. now about 54% international versus [indiscernible] 60% when guys hedge IPO. I just am wondering what you think is causing the shift in international market. What do you think gets the new construction development reinvigorated?","Christopher Nassetta","You've got those numbers, exactly right. The IPO was 64 they announced, 54, 46. And I think, here's that I say, I mean, obviously the different parts of the world move in a different cadence, the U.S. development side particularly in a limited service base has been picking up steam, you can see it in our numbers and some others numbers. And other parts of the world including Europe slowed down now are picking up steam. Asia-Pac compared to where it was has slowed down somewhat. I'd say the Middle East is generally consistent.","What I'd love is, and we did talk a lot about at the IPO is, at our scale and with the breadth of chain scale diversification we have, we have the ability to sort of ebb and flow with market conditions and went everywhere. So, the idea is, there are going to be times where, and we saw it for the five years leading up to maybe last year that China and Asia-Pacific are roaring, they're going to be times, and the U.S. and Europe were very slow. Now, Asia-Pacific is slowing somewhat modestly and Europe is finally stabilizing improving a bit.","And the development side in the U.S. is starting to pick-up, pick up some steam. So that - this is one of the great things about diversification that, as that's going on, we are making sure that we're really thoughtful about our development strategies, making sure we have the right resources in the right place that we're layering our brands in the right way, that is satisfying both the consumer demand obviously. But also, where the capital is flowing in these various parts of the world.","And the idea is that, if we're intelligent and strategic about how we do that, we're going to keep growing and we're going to grow in an accelerated pace, no matter what's going on in the world, because the world is a big place, and it's diversified world and we're going to be able to continue to gain momentum by being intelligent. So that what we've seen is just what I said, the U.S. and Europe now are picking up a little bit providing a little bit more of the growth up until in 2010 through 2013 when we went public. The U.S. had little or nothing going on, Europe was in stays and Asia Pacific was big part of the story. That's why I like horror story frankly relative to others is that we can do this. We've got 12 of the best brands with the highest market share and create development teams around the world and we push and pull and very strategic about what we're doing around the world to continue to grow our base of hotels to better serve customers where any need they have anywhere in the world they want to be.","Felicia Hendrix","Thanks. And if I could just bring it back to the quarter results for a second, you gave us some very helpful color on the weaker [indiscernible] business in May. Can you just help us understand what percentage of your system wide room count ended up being affected by the weather and the weaker energy demand just to drive the 100 basis points decline in RevPAR?","Christopher Nassetta","Yeah, I wouldn't guess if you combine it, so I don't have the exact number so hopefully we'll get back to you, but not insignificant, I would say probably because it was a large swap of the limited service system and franchise system that was really impacted, I would guess 20%. But I'll ask Christian and Joe to take care of that, but we did do the math, I just don't have the number of hotels.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That's...","Christopher Nassetta","Not, not insignificant.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Shaun Kelley","Thanks and thanks for taking my question. So just to maybe switch gears and talk a little bit about strategic alternatives. Chris you eluded a little bit about this in your prepared remarks. So the first question I have is, last quarter the only thing we could talk about was M&A and this quarter made it five questions and without asking about it. So, you know how does M&A fit into the strategic alternatives, could you sort of alluded to real estate and timeshare, but didn't mentioned to that. So, how are you thinking about that today, and how that change it all?","Christopher Nassetta","I think, it is not changed. I think, we think about it very consistently with what I've articulated and Kevin and others have articulated before, and that is, we feel really good about the attributes of the company, as they stand, and our ability to expand those attributes organically meaning launching new brands, and as a result, be able to leave the industry in growth and doing in a very capital like way, which we think is going to drive the best returns on equity in the business. And so, I've been pretty clear in saying you'd never say never, I mean, we look at everything that's out there, generally, and you know if there is - we found anything that sort of went through our filter being highly strategic for us and economically compelling in terms of value enhancing to the company, it would be something that we have consider.","I will say I don't really see anything that's out there right now that that gets through that filter, and that's because of a good problem we have, which is, getting back to what I started with. We have pretty much in our view what we need to be successful. That doesn't mean, [indiscernible] we're going to launch new brands, we talked about big scale, we just launched two new brands last year, Home2 not too long before that, but given the base size of the company, our scale, our geographic distribution, our existing chain scale distribution, importantly 10,000 owner groups that we have an amazing relationship with, we think that the, the higher return answer for investors - all investors including ourselves is to really focused on our organic growth.","So in a simple way, I would say, we are not particularly acquisitive. But we are always trying to be intelligent and thoughtful.","Shaun Kelley","That's very helpful. And then my follow-up would just be, when we think about the other two alternatives in terms of more organic things you can do. The real estate, the regroup which you know as better than anyone on - the evaluations that have come off fairly significantly in the last few weeks and the quality things are volatile. But the question is on does it change in or does the recent change in valuation have a material impact on where you guys are sort of viewing that longer term set of alternatives for the real estate side?","Christopher Nassetta","No, I don't think so. I mean we're really trying to look at this as I've described a couple of times do have very long-term lends, which is when you think about the company is its best - do we think we can create the most value for shareholders over the long-term in our current setup or another setup. And so, it is a very - it is very much a long-term view. We've done a considerable amount of work, and looking at all the options as you can imagine, it's quite complex structurally manageable, but [indiscernible] quite complex, and we want to be really thoughtful about the value levers, because we're not in the business of doing things for practice, we're in the business of doing things that we think are going to create long-term value. So, we have done a lot of work. We'll continue to do a lot of work in - as I said certainly before the end of the year, I think we can layout the rational for how we want to move forward. But these recent ups and downs, I think when we're looking to a longer term lends at least what I've seen so far, it doesn't really have any material impact on our thinking.","Shaun Kelley","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning, Chris. I guess maybe to put - maybe a finer point on it is, in products, how are you thinking then about your 2016 RevPAR growth either domestically or globally, just as compared to the pace in 2015. Do you think, it's going to hold or accelerate or even sorry [ph] ?","Christopher Nassetta","I'll go back to what I think I started saying at the IPO. IPO is really good and I said earlier today, Jeff, I think we will be in that 5% to 7% range. We have not started to begin on doing our - into our budgeting process that you actually start, we'll start to kick off in a couple of weeks. But we're in a regular dialogue around the company and with all of our regional heads about their view of this year and next and obviously looking at the pace of bookings, and I think, that the cycle is alive and well, I standby what I said, which is I think, we will be able to for the next couple of years at least deliver RevPAR growth in that time zone, and that - that's what we will be aiming towards.","Jeff Donnelly","And I apologize it. I got on a - a little like, can you talk about your perspective on trends and pricing in China in the next 12 months versus the past 12 months, just given some of the headlines we've been seeing in the - into the market falling and a low with consumption or what not?","Christopher Nassetta","China, obviously, the economic growth story there is one of a bit of deceleration. I think, they're going to great lengths to stabilize their markets to keep consumer confidence high, because in the end they're transitioning that economy to be a consumption-led economy, not unlike ours, and many of the other more mature economies, so I suspect, there'll be some bumps and bruises along the way as they're always are in these things, but that the underlying fundamentals of $1.3 billion people that are no question have ups and downs, but are gaining in wealth that is going to allow them over an extended period of time to accomplish their objective. I think they've been reasonably smart. I suspect they'll continue to be reasonably smart. We are seeing reasonably healthy results in the market. I think the hotel space there is in its nascent stages of development and growth. I mean there're certainly some markets, some of the core markets that maybe have had more development than others, but if you look at representation per room, yeah, thousands of people per room or rooms per thousand people rather in China, it is still much lower than any of the divesting or the developed western economy.","So I think any stage you look at the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years and China will have ups and downs but will be a rise up meaning you're going to continue to see a massive amount of development because you're going to have a massive amount of demand coming from their consumers and more people visiting China.","When you look at the current trends, I gave you the number we had a great second quarter. We still think will be 6% to 8% for the full year. Some of that is we're getting a network effect and we're gaining market share, I only think that gets better. I think the story is much more - I've been saying this for two years by the way and that's why we've done what we've done. I think it's becoming very much a mid-market story. It's not that you're not going to build more Hiltons and Waldorfs and Conrads. But you're going to build fewer of them and it's going to - the market's going to fill in like it did in other parts of the world, the U.S., in particular which is the most segmented with midscale kind of brands. We're very aggressively trying to do that because that's what's going to build our infrastructure and our network and distribution but you're going to create that network effect like we have in other parts of the world, the U.S. predominantly and Europe as well.","So we feel very good about China, I mean if you look at deals being signed in China, it reflects everything I just said, if you look at the staff year-to-date, we signed exactly the same number of deals in China this year as last. Last year 17% for limited service this year 53% for limited services, okay. So there's still whole service and above getting done which is a very different profile and my guess if that's for the year, I think you're going to see the same thing. I actually think we'll sign more deals in the first half, actually I think our deal flow will accelerate the size of the hotels will become much smaller, we'll have a velocity of more deals, more distribution, more in the midscale on limited services side of the business.","That's what's going on and it doesn't mean it'll ebb and flow and you'll have surges over time at the high end of the business as well but that's what sort of got and China at the low end of the business got very built out, the high end of the business got reasonably built out. It's really the middle of that sort of missing which is why we focused on it and I think for the next three years, four years, five years that's where the real - that's where the demand is that's where they don't have enough capacity, that's I think economics are good, the money is going to flow through that segment.","Jeff Donnelly","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen","Hi. Good morning. So a bigger picture on the midscale brand launch you're going to do, I think you said in early 2016 or maybe later this year. If you look at supply growth in the U.S. the one chain scale that's actually seeing decline in supply growth in the U.S. is actually the midscale segment and most of the future construction is an upper mid to upscale. So what gives you guys the confidence that you can clearly developers are choosing to build these other slightly higher chain scale properties over mid-scale. So what gives you guys the confidence that you can kind of launch a brand and change that dynamic?","Christopher Nassetta","Everything, you just said gives us the confidence that we're going to do. I think what why you're seeing what you're seeing is there with all due respect those are the products that are out there. There is no good mid-scale product that's why we are doing it. We've had such amaze. If you think about the history of it and I've said this certainly in one-on-one meetings and I think maybe on one of these calls, I mean Hampton was initially targeted to be in that segment. It has just been so successful that it's grown up out of it so it's in upscale. It's not a technically, I think this year will be close a $115 average rates in the system, and as a result there is a huge swap 40% of the demand base in the U.S. markets and similar sort of stats as you go around the world that we find we're not serving as much as we want to because they can't afford our - basically our lowest chain scale product.","So we think there is a big customer base out there that wanted but to your point the reason there has not been a lot of development. I don't think the products just by development the reason that we are taking along to get this right is we are not just going out and saying just do our hands and look alike, we're creating this segment and what we're doing - and when we're doing it in a way that there's going to be unlike anything anybody has done, it's going to be a - all new build against product that's out there that is almost no new build to your point. That's going to be very appealing to the customer and importantly that is engineered both to build and operate in a very simplistic way to be able to drive returns like we've done with Hampton. There will be a lower investment but we are trying to drive a similar type of return. We've been working with our ownership groups, we're way down the path and we think we've cracked that code. So we think we're going to do something. The reason I think this will be thousands of hotels because the demand is there, that is the reason nobody is building there because there's no product that resonates with the customer and these types of products aren't delivering returns to owners.","So they don't build them, they're building Hampton and Garden Inn and Core Garden and Fairfield or whatever. We think we're going to give them an alternative to serve a customer base. We're not serving and they might create returns and have a product that the customer loves, because they have such [indiscernible] now.","So in terms of like fast forward down the road, we're not ignoring the high end of the business. By the way, we have amazing momentum in the luxury space of Conrad and Hilton and then doing amazing things with Curio and Canopy, we gave you some of the stats in terms of number of units and when you fast forward five years and 10 years and 15 years down the line. This can be a megabrand that generates mega EBITDA because this can be 1,000 - the smaller hotels but they're going to be thousands of them just as we've done in Hampton.","Thomas Allen","Thanks. And as my follow up, I think the first question you guys were asked about I think Harry highlighted that investors top concern is just around the cycle. I think investors second highest concern is just around the threat from the sharing economy, and I'm often and people were often accused of being two flipping around that threat. Can you kind of address that? Thanks.","Christopher Nassetta","Yeah. Arabian B or [indiscernible] or anything above I guess.","Thomas Allen","Exactly.","Christopher Nassetta","Yeah. We - you can imagine that we've said around this table that the management team as of - with our board of directors talking about it and really - and we've talked with the Arabian B folks I mean and lots of other things in the industry. In the end, I won't [indiscernible] I view it as a different sort of customer, looking for a different type of experience. I think it's a real business for sure, a growing business for sure that what it really is that its core is a leisure value adventure sort of need that it's fulfilling. That is not what we are. I mean we are at some leisure, yes, but we're not trying to be the cheapest. We're trying to be the highest quality product and service, so the people will pay a premium and we're not trying to provide an adventure in that sense, meaning we wanted to be very high quality product and service that you know exactly what you're getting.","So, I think the proposition when customers - our customers are coming to us, what they're looking for is something different than what they're looking for when they go there. I'm not going to say there is zero overlap that none of our customers ever used them, but I think they use them for different needs, and I think largely as we look at it statistically, okay, in every market is a little different and we can talk about New York, whatever, but if you look at the broad business for those guys, I think it is growing the pie more than anything. I think it is stimulating more travel that wouldn't have occurred, and in the end I think that's a good thing. Getting people travelling more is fantastic. As we think once they're travelling and they get the bug, they're eventually going to come stay with us, because we're going to be able to satisfy a different kind of need that they're going to have, particularly as they sort of grow up and move up in their careers and family then all of those things, so what they're looking for may be a little bit different.","So, I'm not saying, but I'm not trying to be [indiscernible] and say, we don't think about it, we don't care, we dismiss it, we think about it a lot. We talk about it a lot. But those anecdotally and with hard statistics, I think in the end they are not impacting. I do not think they have a material impact on us. I think they make our pie bigger and ultimately stimulating people to travel more and that I think a good thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Carlo Santarelli","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, I know within the context of your group pace for 2016. Kevin, I believe you said mid-single digits. Could you guys talk a little about that the tenure of maybe some of your group discussions over the several months and relative to - we have this conversation at the end of April. And, then maybe if could provide a little bit color on in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter trends?","Christopher Nassetta","See, I would say group tenure is the same. I mean, I don't think there is already material difference. I think we're looking at year, next year, that's going to be another very good year. We're looking at having a good position. So that means, we don't have as much capacity to available for people. So I think that - to kind of just to give us incrementally a bit, a bit more leverage. So I don't - I wouldn't say its moved a whole lot, either way. I mean, if anything, I think our leverage levels for a group of things have gotten little stronger, if I look at west, if I look at sort of the back that up even in the quarter, but certainly going forward, the majority of our group growth is coming through rates. So I think is, for us a good reflection if anything that we're - the leverage level we're getting is growing, not diminishing and it should be, the more we build out, the bigger we based, the more we selective, we can be and there is less sort of capacity for people to book. So we can drive higher rates. In the quarter, bookings were strong, I think they were Q2 forward looking up in the high single digits from our pace point of view. So quite good","Carlo Santarelli","Great. Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Loeb from Baird. Your line is open.","David Loeb","Good morning.","Christopher Nassetta","Good morning, David.","David Loeb","I want to come back to China for a minute. I wanted to ask about your agreement with Plateno, there have been some press accounts, it's just the Plateno and Jin Jiang are getting together, will that have any impact on your deal with them?","Christopher Nassetta","No. I mean we've been in a pretty constant dialogue with them as that has been evolving as you might imagine, and I think our view of a combination of Jin Jiang and Plateno is that together they are even stronger and an even better partner for us than what we're trying to do, and in discussions with them I don't think it changes their commitment to what we're trying to do at all.","David Loeb","Great. Thanks. You've covered all the other important stuff already, so. Thank you.","Christopher Nassetta","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","Hey. Hey, good morning, everyone. Are you seeing any...","Christopher Nassetta","Good morning.","Wes Golladay","...headwinds on that - are you seeing any headwinds on the cost side with developers in the U.S. particularly in the select service?","Christopher Nassetta","Well, I mean the answer is yes, but not in a way that's slowing down our ability to get our - add to our pipeline. There is no question that there is more construction going on and not just in hotels incrementally, obviously, a bit more on hotels, but across the board more infrastructure spending going on. You're starting to see construction in the other areas of real estate, home building is picking up. So there is no question, cost of build are going up at higher than the sort of average inflationary increases, but given the strength of the business in terms of the growth in RevPARs, I think it has generally been keeping up enough that the deals that really make sense that are getting done. That is a reason, by the way and I have articulated this before that I have such confidence in the supply side of it, which is that not all deals make sense. There is a reason that there is basically two companies that make up half a more than half of what's getting built in U.S. and those are the two companies [indiscernible] included that have very, very high market share that allow the economics to work, the [indiscernible] while the other stuff is being getting done is because cost to build are - have been going up and they're high, and if you don't have the high market shares, the economics don't work. So it's sort of a good new story for us, because we've got that market share, we can continue to build our pipeline when others can't - and the cost increases that are going on in construction which are not insignificant are keeping a bit [indiscernible] on overall supply, and I think we'll continue to do so. I don't think the U.S. economy get sort of season this recovery a little bit more, I think that will continue to be problematic.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Now switching over to China, how are the developers funding the projects over there. And can you give us a brief overview profile of the developers?","Christopher Nassetta","Well, the profile is changing, I'd say in the big full service and luxury stuff that is still a component of what's in our pipeline and getting done, and we're still signing some of those deals new, that those are very large companies that that are in a lot of different businesses and in many cases partially government owned or is it local or nationally in national government, and that sort of been the pattern and there is a spattering of publically listed Hong Kong based real estate companies in there, but a lot of those deals have been done by very big Chinese conglomerates that own lots of different, I mean lots of different industry potential and have some government ownership. What's shifting in that is as we're going to a more of a limited service make up because that's where the demand is as I already described, and where the money is flowing, it's changing not unlike in the United States where you're getting smaller players, entrepreneurial players much lesser the big conglomerates and much more diversified smaller entrepreneurial individuals, small companies, families that are making those kinds of investment that I think is a really good thing that's a natural thing, that's exactly you look at the [indiscernible] system in the U.S. as an example of this massively diversified and largely our owners are small families and small businesses. I think that is increasingly what you're going to find happening in China as you shift the business to more of a limit sort of business for us that create, I think a great diversified base of owners that lowers risk and also provide more avenues of growth.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks a lot for taking the question.","Christopher Nassetta","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. I think most of my questions have been answered, maybe just a circle back to one topic for little more clarification, which is a potential for spinning out of REIT. I mean, I think just maintaining the RevPAR guidance is kind of a victory, given the lower RevPAR guidance from the number of other [indiscernible] . So, its sounds like you're saying that kind of lower valuations out there wouldn't deter you interest in a REIT spent, but maybe it's fair to say it would change the potential timing of it?","Christopher Nassetta","Not necessarily, again, I think the lens, we're going to look at which is what I would have, all shareholders would want us to look there is, how do we create the best long-term value for everybody, and so, I think when you're doing that you'll be very careful in my mind to look at any sort of snapshot in time of what it was three months ago or yesterday what it might be a month from now. I think it is sort of, when you look at the different pieces of our businesses, it's a bunch of different filters that you're looking at its relative valuations, its tax efficiencies, its opportunities to activate in different ways various businesses, all against incremental cost of what might be more G&A that more than one enterprise as compared to what we are today, and I think all of those things are factors, not they're complicating too much and not to put tangle [indiscernible] . Those are the sort of factors that we are filtering through as we go through it, and obviously we're kind of seeing what's going on in the market, but we're trying to take a long view on where relative valuations, we think relative evaluations have been and will be.","Robin Farley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Steven Kent","Hi, good morning.","Christopher Nassetta","Good morning.","Steven Kent","Two questions. First, just a better sense for cash used, you generally have been paying down around $200 million in debt every quarter, now you'll be paying around $70 million with the dividend. What will happen to the rest of the $130 million or so, if that kind of go towards debt, you mentioned buybacks, but is there some kind of pacing that you are thinking about or how do you think about that? And then separately that with the other adjustment line item and the adjusted EBITDA bridge, and I just wanted to understand what that is, and how we should be thinking about that other adjustment line over the next couple of quarters?","Kevin Jacobs","Sure, Steve, its Kevin. I think on dividend versus use of cash, I think our other uses of cash are going to stay very similar, we're not going to change our overall outlook on our capital allocation, and we do still, as I said in my prepared remarks want to achieve investment grade. And I think as we've said to you all along that we thought that target range for our balance sheet was between three times or four times leverage. I think we'll find that a little bit as we've gotten into it where we're targeting a range of 3 times to 3.5 times. And so, we think we're going to finish the year at 3.4 times with the dividend. So that gives us a little bit of room to go towards getting into sort of the middle of that range. So you would see the other use would be continued debt pay down in the back half of the year. And then on the other line item, it's pretty straightforward that the line share of that is severance related to the Waldorf story of transaction, which was effectively a transaction cost as part of the overall transaction where we're picking up 80% of the severance deal, and that's all baked into that line [indiscernible] .","Steven Kent","That as a line, will go back to our figure on $20 million or so per quarter?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Yes.","Steven Kent","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Bill Crow","Hey, good morning.","Christopher Nassetta","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Crow","Just to clarify, Kevin you had earlier suggested $800 million debt reduction for the year, you're now increasing that, I'm just trying to build that same bridge between the $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion of capital available to reduce debt and return to shareholders against $800 million debt reduction and $130 million, $140 million dividends?","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah. I think the difference Bill is the Sydney paydowns worth $800 million or so, $800 million or so I think was a prior number, I'm not [indiscernible] I'm not sure exactly what the number you're referring to, but I think it was our prior guidance number and then that moved up to $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion when we sold Sidney and have the Sidney paydown in there, and so now all you would do is take the dividend amount and that would be part of the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Does that answer the question?","Bill Crow","Yeah. I guess so, I though your actual debt retirement paydown number was $800 million for this year, which was actually hit already, but you're increasing that number [indiscernible] , correct?","Well, we increased it last quarter to our guidance went up to $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion last quarter when we reached agreement on Sidney.","Bill Crow","Okay. Of debt reduction, okay. Very good, Chris, couple of quick topics. Myriad signed a marketing and distribution agreement with TripAdvisor, I wanted to get your thoughts on that, any, you'll go reducing commissions paid out. And then the other topic, Chris is, as you think about this potential to divide up the company and knowing that you're kind of allergic to G&A would it not make sense to look for an existing REIT platform that already has the G&A commitment that might make the economics work better?","Christopher Nassetta","Okay. Happy to [indiscernible] on Trip, obviously I'm not going to get into where we might be with any particular party. We've had some discussion with them, those discussions are ongoing, unclear where they will end up. But we made you something with - that's the reason we would see because the terms of what we get term with them are consistent with basically three pillars that we have in dealing with any of our distribution partners, and that is 1) we want complete control of our inventory 2) we want to have the ability to price differentially to our most loyal customers or otherwise known as our honest members, and 3) we want to have very efficient margin structures or commission structures with them.","And I'd say not a pillar, but sort of the overarching philosophy is always going to be that we want to have the most direct relationship we can have with our customer. So, everything we are doing that we talked about in the prepared comments about our HHonors app and straight-to-room, and all of what we are doing with CRMs is all around trying to shift as many people into our direct channels, because number one, we want to have that direct relationship, and two, it's the most cost efficient way for us to be able to distribute our product. It will always - obviously be - we will have distribution partners. I don't see a world where we're going to get everybody to come direct to our channels, the more the better, and when we're going to have distribution channel partners like potentially three or four or others that we are all aware. We are very, very focused on making sure it sort of meets the standards of our three pillars. Then what we do with trip, I don't know, if we can reach the standards of our three pillars, we may do something with them.","On the spends, I don't want to - yes, there is theoretically a rational for - if you decide at some point, you wanted to separate the real state and yes, I do not like incremental GNA, that there would be ways to do it that would be more efficient to doing it ourselves, that when I say we will look at all options, we will look at that option as well.","Bill Crow","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Vince Ciepiel","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have question on margins, they have been impressive in the quarter and year-to-date, when you look at RevPAR growth of your business it's equally been driven by occupancy and rate, so is there anything going on with costs there, and how should we think about margins progressing into the second half?","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah. Vince this is Kevin. We certainly had something's go our way in terms of cost in the quarter. Energy being predominant costs that's been down due to what's going on in the oil markets, and we continue to work our labor management systems to run the properties as efficiently as we can, and so if we achieve RevPAR growth that is in excess of inflation, particularly as you point out of it, it comes more from rate than occupancy, we should be able to continue to drive margin growth.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Thanks. And then, different topic, the last couple - actually last couple of years, Hampton, Doubletree and Garden Inn have led you guidance as RevPAR growth. I noticed they are more in line with the system average this quarter. So I guess first, how much of that's related to kind of the weather taxes impact you alluded to? And then second, you guys provided kind of a positive longer term outlook, just part of that those brands leading system [indiscernible] RevPAR growth going forward?","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah, I think, I think it is partially a result of those brands being more impacted by the things that impact the Q2 for sure. But as we've said in couple of calls ago, we do believe that RevPAR growth levels are going converge as between the lower segments and the upper segments, and I think, when we look at the balance of the year, and we look in the next year and frankly the year-to-date even sort of extracting out the weather impact, we believe that's happening. The upper end of the business is definitely catching up, which is I think a good thing. International thing is as the group base continues to build because the upper end is more driven by that Group base.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Joel Simkins","Yeah, good morning guys. I can't believe we've made it 67 minutes on the timeshare. But timeshare obviously has continued momentum for you can you just give us a little bit color on what you're seeing out there in this business, whether it relates to tour flow, package size, well I miss to use financing and then you are seeing some additional opportunities with this to continue to feed them own to retail inventory or something that tend one assets to this business?","Christopher Nassetta","We're - the timeshare but we didn't spend in time on time it's doing incredibly well they look at it again others that are reporting, I mean our tour flow numbers are way up in the quarter up 9%, VPG is up 7.5%. We expect those kinds of numbers plus or minus for the full year. So our timeshare business is hitting and also and there is and it's doing honestly in a very different way as we've talked about then all of our competitors in the sense that we've got the vast majority now over 80% of our inventory that is what we're doing that a very capitalized way, I think 60% roughly of our sales in the quarter were in the capitalized segment. So we have really, I think - I know I have really transformed this business over the last three or four years and we continue to build momentum, I know there's always a question like was it sustainable and can you keep building the inventory and I think we have proven our inventory numbers have been moving up even as the economy hits stronger, people thought well there won't be broken deals and we've proven just because of the returns we can deliver that we're able to find more and more counterparties that want to do this with us. So, we announced - I think Kevin comment a couple of deals, we did it quickly and gently. But we just did another in the quarter, another couple of capital light deal. So, Kevin may want to add to it. I think this business is cranking and sitting on all cylinders. Our team is doing an amazingly good job.","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah. I think as it relates to the consumer Joe, I mean the consumer confidence is up, right. And so, the time shares, it is at the end of the day, consumer products driven by how the consumer feels about their own outlook and their own balance sheet. And so, you are seeing [indiscernible] see high levels of sales growth, more people willing to go on tours. On the margin, we haven't really changed the financing profile of the business that much. But on the margin that consumer willing to borrow a little bit more to stretch with that project - product, because they feel good about their own balance sheet. And then the last thing, Joe, I didn't quite follow the question as it related back to the 1031, were you are asking if there are time share opportunities specifically at those assets?","Joel Simkins","Yeah. Those assets are - how you continue to think about parsing out a couple for [indiscernible] your own hotels to these types of projects particularly urban locations?","Christopher Nassetta","Yeah. I think we continue to think about those kinds of things that the 1031, there is - the urban hotel in San Francisco, who knows. But I think as Chris mentioned, we are - we're finding really good capital light deals to do. So, we look at those first, and then we always continue to look at opportunities for value enhancement in our properties including at the 1031. I'm not sure that there will be any major projects there, but we are certainly finding good ROI projects to do in that portfolio whether or not there will be in the time share state, I'm not sure. But we will create value in those...","Kevin Jacobs","In the owned segment including properties that we have owned for a period of time, there are two or three incremental opportunities over time to take pieces of existing hotels, something that we will more potentially at the New York Hilton and so, and we've talked a little bit about Hawaii in Waikoloa [ph] and there are one or two other urban markets where I think there is some opportunities that were moving down the path on and at the appropriate time we'll make sure we let you guys know about them.","Joel Simkins","That's very helpful. One quick follow-up if I may here. Chris, you call out some very interesting mobile, check-ins [indiscernible] , and I certainly recognize this isn't all about cost savings, but it sounds like you've had some pretty high adoption rates, clearly the consumer wants to control their experience, so in terms of that small base of the hotels you're deployed at currently, do you - are you seeing any real meaningful kind of front of the house, back of the house, how is efficiency opportunities?","Christopher Nassetta","Not yet, because it's too early in the process. I mean right now, we're not trying to drive cost and as you pointed out, eventually, I think it is there opportunities to drive costs down and\/or repurpose people, but at the moment we're using - we're doing - we're using those people to sort of help retrain our customers. So not unlike, I feel like how the airlines did this and they went to online check in and kiosk [indiscernible] . In the beginning, there is a lot of work in training and human resource effort to get people to adopt, understand and make sure work.","So, we're in that stage, but the adoption rates are huge, by the way I didn't noted, but the satisfaction rates are off the chart. Think about it, it's a real simple philosophy. You guys, everybody wants, what you want and I want. They want choice and control in the palm of their hand and they want to interact with us just like they're interacting with so many other businesses in every - their everyday life, and so, the hotel business honestly over time probably hasn't kept up with that. We're trying to not only keep up with it, but get ahead of it. I do think ultimately it's going to build increased loyalty and market share. It's going to create cross-sell opportunities and up-sell opportunities that I think are going to be meaningful and it's going to create cost efficiencies, okay. It's not incremental extra cost now I'd say sort of neutral but ultimately there will be cost efficiencies as we get broad adoption.","Joel Simkins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Agnew from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Christopher Agnew","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Christopher Nassetta","Good morning.","Christopher Agnew","Agree with your sentiments air BMB, but just wanted to follow up with the question. A) is the risk that the rapid growth of alternative accommodation is holding back pricing power, or even has the potential to hold back pricing power for the industry given that these types of accommodation can come into their own when there is compression. So how do you think about the risks that pricing power is maybe weaker than in previous cycles, or what it should be given favorable supply demand conditions in the industry? Thanks.","Christopher Nassetta","Yeah, not to be a poly I mean obviously any type of supply could have the effect of taking away our pricing power and there may be markets where there is some impact there. It's not an impact as we look at it enough that we can measure, and as I said, I think it's just a different kind of customer. So the largest part of our base of customers is really a business customer for a business purpose.","And I know they're trying to get in that business and good luck and then and I'm sure they'll love the business, but I just don't think in terms of the core customer that we're serving and what that core customer is telling us that they want from us that they're enough similarities where they overlap is creating a really credible alternative that's effecting pricing power in a meaningful way as we study.","Again, you can probably pick micro-markets and there'd be exceptions to but broadly we are not seeing. I don't expect to see it.","Christopher Agnew","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Chad Beynon","Great. Thank you very much. With respect to corporate negotiated rate budgeting and the timing of these conversations with your partners in the next couple of months, acknowledging that the majority of the leverage is in your favor as you spoken about how important is the timing of these conversations against a potential fed rate increase and how important is the size of that increase in these negotiations maybe some anecdotes over the past couple of cycles what you've seen during other periods when rates were increasing? Thanks.","Christopher Nassetta","Yeah, it's a good question, I'm going to ask to admit I haven't actually scientifically done the correlation that increases while we're in negotiations on corporate rate. So I can't give you an exact answer. Here is what I'd say that anecdotally, I do think we have more pricing power, so if we were in the sort of low to mid-single digits I would - this year, I would expect we'd be in the mid to higher single digits, just because we do have incrementally more pricing power while increasing rates could have an impact. The net results of increasing - the reason rates would be going up to begin whether the economy is stronger. If they're going up faster than people expect it just means ultimately the economy is stronger than everybody expects. The economy being stronger is advantageous to us meaning kind of we being stronger is creating more demand for room nights there is the same amount of capacity essentially because there is very limited new set capacity coming on. It should incrementally give us more pricing power. So not that I want to rates to go up fast, don't get me wrong, but if rates started to go a lot better faster clip, I think it\u2019s reflective of our business [indiscernible] ultimately we are, we re-price every day and ultimately reflective of our business being very, very strong, and I think gives us more leverage in the negotiation.","Chad Beynon","Okay. Thanks. And can you provide us with the percentage of your managed properties that paid IMS during the quarter versus last year?","Christopher Nassetta","Yeah. I think it was in the low 50s versus - that - it was in the low 60s this year versus low 50s last year.","Chad Beynon","Okay. Thank you very much.","Christopher Nassetta","You bet.","Christopher Nassetta","Okay. Is that - I guess we're done by questions. So thanks everybody for joining the call, we'll, I don't know where our operator is, maybe she disappeared, but we appreciate this time today, obviously pleased with the quarter, very excited about the way we think the second half of the year is going play out. Looking forward to getting back with you after our third quarter end. Take care. Have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference."],"10942":["Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.

Please note that today's conference call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Christian Charnaux, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Christian Charnaux - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Denise. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our recently filed Form 10-K.","In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide greater details on our expectations for the year ahead. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're happy to kick off what should be an exciting year for Hilton Worldwide with our tremendous development momentum, new distribution initiatives supported by our largest marketing campaign ever as well as the planned spins of our real estate and timeshare businesses announced this morning. We think we're well positioned to drive value for guests, hotel owners, and shareholders alike. While we're confident in our ability to deliver industry-leading value over the long-term, we do realize that shorter-term macro concerns are weighing on sentiment. Despite increased uncertainty, we remained optimistic that 2016 fundamentals will continue to support top line growth.","As we noted on our last earnings call, corporate transient demand began weakening in October and those trends continued throughout the quarter and into this year. Corporate transient performance in the U.S. did diverge in the quarter with oil and gas markets seeing declines, while non-oil and gas markets continued to be up in the mid-single-digits.","Going forward, we expect corporate transient volume to remain highly correlated with the GDP and non-residential fixed investment, both forecast to grow this year modestly lower than last. Furthermore, corporate negotiated rates as well as group position are both up in the mid-single-digits this year, providing a good setup for continued growth.","When coupled with supply growth that continues to run well below long-term averages, we believe, we are poised for solid RevPAR growth in 2016. As a result, we expect system-wide full year 2016 comp RevPAR growth between 3% to 5% with rate expected to account for 90% of that growth. This same-store growth coupled with accelerating net unit growth should drive high-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016.","Fueled by the strength of our 12 clearly-defined market-leading brands, we opened approximately 50,000 gross and 43,000 net rooms in 2015, representing 6.6% net unit growth in our managed and franchised segment, and a nearly 20% increase versus 2014. This was accomplished with no meaningful capital expenditures or brand acquisitions on our part and it included more than 14,000 rooms converted from competitors' brands and independent hotels.","We continue to grow our industry-leading pipeline, signing over 100,000 rooms in the year for a total global development pipeline of 275,000 rooms including all approved deals. More than half of our pipeline is already under construction and represents nearly one in five of all rooms under construction globally, more than any other hotel company.","Our growth rate in coming years will also benefit from our new midscale brand, Tru by Hilton. The brand's innovative design will appeal to a broad range of customers with a price point 25% lower than Hampton. It's tightly engineered design, relatively small footprint, and low development costs should drive very attractive returns for hotel owners. At its launch last month at Alice, we had nearly 130 deals in process, none of which were in our reported pipeline.","To-date, we have over 160 deals in process and more than one in every four commitments received in January was for a Tru franchise. We have very high expectations for the growth potential of this new brand and expect to eventually open thousands of Tru hotels with the first opening expected later this year or early next.","Tru will also further strengthen our network effect by bringing new and younger customers into our system and offering more opportunities for existing customers to stay with us. We also want to offer customers even more compelling reasons to have a direct relationship with us. This month, we launched our largest global marketing campaign ever entitled, Stop Clicking Around, highlighting key customer benefits of our network and its scale namely the joining Hilton HHonors and booking directly with Hilton offers customers the best value and a better experience.","This includes offering HHonors members their points, of course, as well as preferential pricing, free Wi-Fi, and the ability to check-in and choose their room online as well as straight-to-room capabilities that we're deploying to all of our hotels globally. By broadly marketing these benefits, we hope to drive growth of our preferred channels, including our industry-leading mobile app that will increase our value proposition to guests as well as to our hotel owners.","This morning, we also announced our intention to enhance long-term value for shareholders by separating our real estate and timeshare business segments, resulting in three publicly-traded companies. We have been clear about exploring our options and strategically manage that process in a way that allowed us to preserve the optionality to efficiently execute spins. We're pleased to have obtained a private letter ruling for the IRS for both spins.","By simplifying our business, each segment should benefit from a dedicated management team with the capital and resources available to take advantage of both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We believe it will also allow investors to more effectively allocate capital towards businesses more in line with their objectives. We intend to elect REIT status for the newly formed real estate company, enabling it to operate in a structure that is competitive with its peers, to facilitate access to capital markets, and to be more tax efficient.","Currently contemplated to include approximately 70 properties and 35,000 rooms, the real estate company will form one of the largest and most geographically-diversified publicly-traded lodging REITs. It will have a high quality portfolio of luxury and upper upscale hotels located across high barrier-to-entry urban and convention markets, top resort destinations, select international markets, and strategic airport locations.","The portfolio will be operated under our market-leading brands with industry-leading RevPAR index premiums. We expect the newly formed timeshare company to manage nearly 50 club resorts in the United States and Europe. The company will benefit from an exclusive license agreement with Hilton Worldwide, which will provide the right to market, sell, and operate resorts under the Hilton Grand Vacations brand, while also providing access to our strong commercial services platform and loyalty program.","In addition, the timeshare company will continue growing its market-leading capital efficient business model. Our intention is to complete these spins by the end of the year with appropriate leadership, strategies, and capital structures in place to set all three companies up for success. We expect to file Form 10 registration statements with the SEC, which will obviously contain a great deal of detailed information on these spins, we intend to do that during the second quarter of 2016.","In closing, we are optimistic on the fundamentals and we believe that our clear strategy, scaled commercial engines, and a well-defined brand portfolio that can serve our customers for any need anywhere in the world, should continue delivering long-term value.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin for further details on the quarter and the year. Kevin?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our results for the year were quite strong with system-wide comparable RevPAR growing 5.4% on a currency neutral basis. Rate gains accounted for two-thirds of full year RevPAR growth. Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high-end of our guidance at $2.879 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13% with margins increasing 290 basis points.","Turning to our fourth quarter results, overall performance came in largely as expected, although, lower growth in corporate transient demand, particularly in focused service hotels, drove modestly lower than anticipated top line growth. System-wide comparable RevPAR grew 3.7% on a currency neutral basis. We saw a particular weakness in oil and gas markets, which we estimate adversely impacted system-wide RevPAR growth by 50 basis points in the quarter. Solid results in leisure helped quarterly performance as RevPAR increased more than 5%, driven by both occupancy and rate gains. Strong growth in BAR and leisure group business, where revenue was up 7% and 6%, respectively, in our Americas full service portfolio also boosted results.","In spite of lower top line growth, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased to $745 million, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. The beat was primarily driven by better than expected corporate and other segment results, franchise sales, and some one-time items. For the quarter, system-wide adjusted EBITDA margins increased to solid 230 basis points versus the prior period to 41.4%. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items increased 29% in the quarter to $0.22 at the midpoint of our guidance range with an incremental $0.02 of negative headwind from FX.","Now turning to our segments. Management and franchise fees totaled $428 million in the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase, which meaningfully exceeded our guidance range. This strong performance was driven by better than expected franchise sales including change of ownership and application fees as well as license fees.","For the full year, management and franchise fees increased over 15% to approximately $1.7 billion as solid RevPAR growth at comp hotels coupled with new units continued to drive growth.","In the ownership segment, RevPAR grew 3.6% in the quarter as growth was tempered by softer demand in Chicago, New Orleans, and Key West. Pressure was somewhat mitigated by strong RevPAR growth in Orlando, which was up nearly 9% in the quarter, while trends in Hawaii were also strong as a solid group base drove higher transient ADR.","Given a favorable group mix, EBITDA at our Hawaiian properties also benefited from strong food and beverage business. Adjusted EBITDA for the ownership segment was $275 million, up 5% versus fourth quarter 2014 when adjusted for the sale of the Hilton Sydney. Margins expanded over 150 basis points on the same basis, helped by the 1031 acquisitions and greater flow-through from rate-driven RevPAR growth.","For the full year, adjusted EBITDA for the ownership segment totaled nearly $1.1 billion, representing an 8% increase versus 2014 when adjusted for the Hilton Sydney disposition. Ownership margins expanded roughly 170 basis points.","Timeshare segment revenues increased to $334 million in the quarter, driven by improved tour flow, which was up nearly 10%, somewhat offset by VPG declines of 2% as we lapped The Grand Islander launch last year. For the full year, tour flow increased a strong 10% and VPG rose 8%, helping drive full year adjusted EBITDA to $352 million, which was above the high-end of guidance.","We also continued to make progress on our ongoing shift to a capital efficient business with third-party intervals increasing to 66% of intervals sold for full year 2015 and accounting for 85% of inventory or 114,000 units. During the quarter, HGV signed another capital efficiency for service deal, the former Westin Orlando Universal Boulevard, which was rebranded as Las Palmeras and will soon be converted to a 226-unit HGV club resort. The property will be HGV's fourth in Orlando.","Now turning to regional performance for the quarter and our guidance for 2016. In the U.S., comparable RevPAR grew 3.8% in the quarter, pressured by demand softness in corporate transient business. Houston and New Orleans struggled with weaker demand due to energy market declines, while increasing supply in New York continued to weigh on pricing power. For full year 2016, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in the low- to mid-single-digits, while we expect concerns in energy-driven markets to continue, the effect should wane as the year progresses and we lap easier comps. The strong U.S. dollar will likely continue to affect inbound demand but to a lesser extent in 2016 than it did last year.","In the Americas, outside the U.S., RevPAR rose 4.7% in the quarter as strong performance in Central America offset declines in Brazil, owing to a deepening economic recession and weakening currency in that market. For full year 2016, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be mid-single-digits boosted by the Olympics in Brazil this summer.","RevPAR in Europe increased 5% in the quarter, supported by strong market share gains, strong group business contributed meaningfully to performance across the region with group revenue up more than 8% in the quarter. Additionally, Germany benefited from strong leisure growth which mitigated softer transient business in London and political instability across certain markets. For full year 2016, we expect low- to mid-single-digit RevPAR growth for the European region.","The Middle East and Africa region struggled, given the shift in timing of the Hajj, which benefited the third quarter but led to a year-over-year RevPAR decline of nearly 9% in the fourth quarter.","Additionally, we saw declines in Egypt driven by cancellations and travel slowdowns following the Russian airliner crash, while the UAE experienced a shortfall in leisure volume. With uncertainty in the region expected to continue weighing on results, our full year 2016 RevPAR assumes a low-single-digit growth.","In Asia-Pacific region, RevPAR increased 6.7% in the quarter, as robust group volume in Japan supported a 15% RevPAR increase in the country, an influx of Chinese tour groups drove 18% growth in Thailand, and we gained market share driving our RevPAR index up over 2 points in the region. RevPAR growth in Greater China decelerated to 3% in the quarter, ending the year up 7%.","For full year 2016, we expect RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region to increase in the mid-single-digits with RevPAR in China up 5% to 6% due largely to market mix, continued share gains, and new hotel ramps, tempered by a softer economic setup in that country.","Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share, bringing our total dividend payout to $138 million for 2015. Our board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of 2016.","We also reduced long-term debt by more than $230 million during the quarter. Our total debt reduction for the year was approximately $1 billion, resulting in a net debt-to-trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.3 times, down from 4.1 times at the end of 2014.","We remain committed to achieving a low investment grade credit profile and still expect to initiate a stock buyback program later this year. For full year 2016, we expect RevPAR growth of 3% to 5% and net unit growth in managed and franchised rooms of 6.5% to 7.5% to result in adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.02 billion to $3.1 billion. That includes $25 million of expected FX headwinds. We estimate adjusted EPS of $0.92 to $0.98. And cash available for debt reduction and capital return of $800 million to $1 billion for the year.","Please note that our full year guidance does not incorporate the impact of our intended real estate and timeshare spins. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect 2% to 4% system-wide RevPAR growth. This is lower than our full year forecast, given late January weather impacts of about 50 basis points, market softness in select gateway cities such as New York and Chicago, all exacerbated by relatively tough first quarter comps.","We expect adjusted EBITDA between $630 million and $650 million. And diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.15 to $0.17. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as 2016 guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. I'm sure you have a lot of questions about our real estate and timeshare spins. We unfortunately cannot provide many additional details at this time. But, as Chris mentioned, we expect to file Form 10 registration statements with the SEC during the second quarter.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will be Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","First, I just wanted to compliment you on receiving your PLR, I'm not sure investors really appreciate how tough it was to get it.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Just kind of a two-part, one question, if I can get away with that. First of all, you've been contemplating the spin for a while and I'm curious if there are \u2013 if the spin allows the separate companies to undertake growth strategies that they've not done before that would add value. And then turning to Blackstone, there are some concerns that they would have to take their ownership stake down to accomplish the spin. Can you give us some insight into whether or not that has to happen?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, happy to, on both fronts. As Kevin said, we're going to provide a heck of a lot more detail when we file our Form 10s to give everybody a really good sense about these companies. But I'm happy to give some directional sort of guidance on that. I'd say, the way to look at all three of these companies is \u2013 and the reason for \u2013 in part, for the separation of these companies, is to, of course, have dedicated management teams and allow for dedicated investor bases. It's, obviously, to create capital markets and cost of capital efficiencies. We're doing this to create tax efficiencies.","And, last but not least, we're doing it to be able to activate all three businesses fully. When we think about activating it, to your specific question, I think that means both organic and inorganic growth. And so, I think the way to look at each of these businesses is that they are going to be setup to be the leaders in each of their segments and to be able to do everything that they need to do to be successful and grow long-term value. If that includes inorganic opportunities, then they certainly will have the capability to pursue those. On the BX question, that I know has come up a lot of times, we do \u2013 BX does not need to sell down in order for us to complete the transactions in the timeframes that we've talked about.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And the follow-up question would be, there has been some discussion about tax efficiency. Would that be impacted at all by them not selling down?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, we get one question, right?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Harry, I guess padded his a little bit (22:33).","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","(22:33) So I don't know where we're going with this.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All bets are off.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Let's start with one.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Look, I know you guys can't talk a lot about the transaction. I'm going to ask one. Just, could you just help us think about the capital structure? Would you expect to refinance the debt that's associated with owned real estate and are there any mandatory payments that are going to have to be made because of the transaction?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Here's the way I think about it on the capital structure. Again, we're going to give you great amount of detail when we file our Form-10. There are no material financings required to get all of this done as I think we've talked about on prior calls. When we went public \u2013 just prior to going public, when we put the debt in place and we had the real estate related debt or the CMBS debt, we set it up to be portable. So it is portable and we can move the debt over.","We may, opportunistically, enter those markets because we can improve the situation and have an even stronger balance sheet, but we don't need to do it. So I think the way to think about it is, we may if the markets are attractive during the timeframe between now and when we execute on the spins, we may in fact enter those markets. But there's no major financings required in order to get it done.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, no mandatory payments.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, no mandatory payments.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, no mandatory payments, excuse me. Yes.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, do these planned spins off impact your ability to begin share repurchases this year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not in a material way. I'd say giving you a little bit of color on that, in order to get the transactions done, we will, by definition, have one-time costs. There will be friction that we've talked about on a number of occasions on prior calls in terms of operating three companies instead of one. The net effect of those things is a small amount of incremental leverage if you just do the math.","We maintain our desire to want to be in low-grade investment grade, and ultimately within the OpCo business. And, that is, we've said sort of low- to mid-3s, I think really in the lower-3s. The effect of having a small amount of incremental debt means that it takes a little bit longer to get there. But, let me \u2013 we had been talking sort of mid-year-ish, I think, directionally. I think it means that we'll be in the second half of the year. But, we still have every expectation that we will begin \u2013 even with the spins, we will be able to begin a buyback program at some point later in this year.","Obviously, we have a lot of moving parts at the moment. When you're taking a 100-year-old \u2013 nearly 100-year-old company and breaking it into three pieces, there is all sorts of things structurally that are going on. So, we want to get a little bit further down the line. But, it would be our intention and I think our credit even with a very small amount of incremental leverage associated with doing the spins. Our credit will be where we would want it to be in the second half of this year.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, it sounds like both no financial gating factors, but also no regulatory gating factors.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is correct.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Chris, have you determined who's going to be running the REIT, who's going to be running the OpCo and presumably the timeshare guys will be running the timeshare business?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's a really good question. And the answer is, you're pretty much directionally right. We have \u2013 at HGV, we have an amazing leader in Mark Wang, who will become the CEO of that business. That business is reasonably self-contained. Mark has been running it. He's a 30-year veteran of the business, in my opinion, strong opinion, the best guy in that business and I think has been and will continue to be a great leader of that business.","On the real estate REIT side, we are considering various options at various levels that involve both internal and external candidates. And, hopefully, somewhere around the time of the filings or just thereafter, we'll be able to give you a little bit more clarity.","Let me be clear, our objective is really simple, we want the best in all three businesses, we want to have the best management teams in the business, and we want each of these businesses to be the clear leaders in their business. And so, that will be sort of the philosophy as we build our teams.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And the REIT that will have the roughly 35,000 rooms, how much of EBITDA is associated with those 35,000 rooms?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We will give you that in our Form 10. I know you're going to get tired of hearing me say that. But we'll give all of that disclosure when we file.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","The next question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone. Good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Carlo.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","If I may, I'd like to ask a little bit about the management franchise guidance for 2016. You guys are, obviously, guiding your fees 7% to 9%, RevPAR growth 3% to 5%, with unit growth kind of in the 6.5%, 7.5% range, is the entire delta there just primarily FX or other \u2013 some other things that maybe we should be aware of?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","There is a \u2013 Carlo, it's Kevin \u2013 there is a little bit of FX, but then also if you look at 2015 we had a couple of, I wouldn't even refer to them as one-time, I'd refer to them as more timing items that caused 2015 to come in a lot higher than we thought at 15% in that segment. So we're lapping those comps a little bit. So that's all it is.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So more of a smoothing over the two year then?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then if I could just follow up a little bit on what you guys are seeing, specifically, in the leisure segment with respect to more kind of current environment pricing ability and the ability to drive rate, would you guys be able to provide some color on that?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean, I think the way to think of that business as you're seeing pockets \u2013 there are areas that have been a little bit weaker and that's really been IBT, individual business traveler segment has been weak for the reasons that we articulated in the prepared comments and that I know everybody has been talking about. BAR has been quite strong. So that would be sort of the negotiated corporate business. BAR, best available rate, which is the non-negotiated, has actually continued to be quite strong.","Leisure up in the low- to mid-single-digits. Leisure has been up in sort of the mid-single-digit. So maintaining strength. And group has been reasonably strong. And as we mentioned briefly in the prepared comments, the group pace has been good at the end of last year and into the beginning of this year and the group position for the year is up in the mid-single digits. So all feeling pretty good. What sort of weighing \u2013 I think what's weighing on the IBT business is a bunch of different factors, I think largely it's a little bit \u2013 it's, obviously, a bit of a slowdown in the broader economy, but it has a lot to do if you really delve into the numbers with the energy markets, which are not just Houston and Dallas and the Southwest.","And those markets, you've seen a clear \u2013 as I described in my comments, a clear bifurcation where those markets are down. If you look at IBT or business broadly, transient business everywhere else, it's still up. But when you put it all together, which is the economy, what you're seeing is sort of lower-single-digit growth in IBT still positive, so not to be a Pollyanna, but still positive. And then, you're weighting up overall performance, because of group, BAR, and leisure.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning and thank you guys. So, Chris, you probably know the REIT business as well as just about everyone out there as well. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the, kind of, general view on kind of capital market receptivity to a new, let's call it, largely full service REIT and how you think this is going to fit into the broader landscape of the lodging REIT community?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean, that's really I should ask you guys that I do have some vague memories of the REIT world from my prior life, but I've tried to expunge all of those, just kidding of course, no. You guys could judge that better than I could. I think what we're doing is really I think setting up a company that's \u2013 that has terrific assets. We've been very thoughtful including when we did the Waldorf sale and took $2 billion and did a 1031 into a bunch of assets, and thinking \u2013 forward thinking about how do we build a portfolio that is in the best strongest markets with the best growth profile with really high-quality assets that \u2013 where we've spent money and maintained the assets, and that are associated with brands that are the market-leading brands.","So when I think about it, our objective is to put this company out there to be a market-leading company both in terms of the assets that it has and the strategy that it has that I think ultimately is to not only drive same-store growth at the high-end of the market, but to be sort of in a fulsome way the best REIT in the business. From my experience being running a REIT really well involves three basic things. It involves managing a balance sheet, it involves being really good at asset management, and it involves being a great capital allocator. And great capital allocator means knowing when to buy, knowing when to sell, there's times to do both of those things, there's times not to be doing those things.","What we're trying to do is both build a portfolio out of the blocks that has great diversification, brand representation, market representation, and growth profile, and a management team that is the best of the best at understanding those three components of the business, so that we both drive same-store growth rates. But we also, through capital allocation at the right times in the right ways, can create a significant amount of value. So that's the objective. I think, as a result of that, I would hope that ultimately the markets will decide that there will be a great level of receptivity to a company that will be a very large cap, ultimately, as a result, liquid stock that is going to go out in the market and be really intelligent sort of focusing on those three pillars of what it takes to be successful from my experience in that world.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Thank you for that. And just as a quick follow-up, but we've got a couple of questions from investors about how to think about incremental SG&A at the two businesses. So I don't know if you could give us a little bit of color or thoughts about how we might think about that?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I know you're \u2013 I said you're going to be tired of hear me say this. We'll give you a lot of color on that when we do our filings. I mean you can triangulate off of things that are out there. I mean, I think, in a very high level, I'd say the timeshare business is other than sort of public company related costs relatively self-contained already, real estate business not as much.","So you can look at what others are spending out there and you can scale it. This is going to be the second \u2013 probably the \u2013 clearly, the second largest. I mean you can do some basic math and not to be evasive. We're still refining those numbers and, at the time, we do the filing, we'll obviously give you some more clarity. But I think you can do a pretty good job directionally by looking at what exists in the marketplace.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Shaun.","Operator","The next question will come from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Two questions. It goes a little bit to what Shaun was saying. You provide intersegment adjustments to get to your adjusted EBITDA by segment. So timeshare fee $45 million, owned fee of about $130 million that are added to managed and franchised EBITDA. Are these the intersegment fees that the independent companies would ultimately pay to each other, or would there be a step-up?","And then, to truly talk about an operating issue, which is Tru, is there any fear that Tru would start to compete with demand for Hampton Inn, especially from developers. How are those two brands differentiated?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the first \u2013 thanks, Steve \u2013 on the first one, that's \u2013 you're right to sort of \u2013 I know you guys are trying to model and trying to figure it out, and we're really not trying, even though it seems like we are, to be evasive. But, we will provide that kind of detail when we file the Form 10s.","I think the way to think about, here's how I'd think about the fees and those two give you some directional guidance. On the timeshare side, there is sort of a market that is formed for essentially a master license arrangement between a brand and timeshare company. So, I think you should think a little bit that we have something in place to probably directionally consistent with the market, and we're going to follow the market.","On the real estate REIT side, similar sort of approach which is obviously, we're going to have very long-tenure agreements. These are really important assets to the operating company, because these are bellwether assets. In terms of economic terms, I think these will be a market-based kind of economics. Some \u2013 whether there will be adjustments or not, we'll clarify. But, I think the way to think about is long-tenure but economics that are market-based.","On Tru, the answer is no. I mean there is always a little bit of sort of cannibalization that goes on around the edges with all the brands. But, I'll tell you the biggest \u2013 the most positive reception that we've had on Tru has been from our Hampton owners. In fact, what we did is go out first really to our existing owners, we have not \u2013 with 163 deals that we've done, it's 100% existing owners, we have not opened it up to outsiders yet, and the very large majority of those people are Hampton owners. They love it, because they realize that it's a different product, different price point. So, frankly, most of the 163 deals that we have done are from Hampton owners that are \u2013 have been part of our process and are very, very supportive of it. So, I think this is intended to be something different. As I say \u2013 I can't say there's never overlap in any of these price points and brands, of course there is on occasion around the edges. But, you're talking about a 25% lower price point, different cost to build, really a different sort of product approach. So, we think this thing is going to do incredibly well, and that it's going to allow Hampton to continue to be incredibly successful at the same time.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question will come from David Loeb of Baird. Please go ahead.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I promise to only ask one, and not ask one about whether you're going to take more than one.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I want to ask actually \u2013 I want to ask about the cancellation fee trial. What did you learn and how will the results impact your revenue management strategies?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We learned a lot in that. And, we did it \u2013 let me \u2013 we did it in a really blunt force way intentionally to sort of see what customers' reactions were. And, I think what we learned is customers hated it, okay? But, not \u2013 that's not really surprising, we knew they would. And, but we did get some nuanced intel out of the experience.","I think going from where we are, which is an industry that not just us but all players in the industry, are willing to tie up inventory essentially for a large part of the customer base at no cost, which sounds illogical, and is illogical, and going from there to what we were testing in one step, I think is very hard just because of consumers have been trained for so long around the model the way it exists.","I think what it tells you, though, and what we've learned is that there are some serious \u2013 there is some real opportunities to change the way we go to market in overall pricing. So it's, as opposed to the test that was quite blunt force intentionally, so we could learn, I think what you will see us do and we're in the process of doing the work and doing other tests right now, is the different ways of pricing our products both for different customers, short, long lead, more and less flexibility. To some extent, not unlike what the airlines and other industries have done.","So I think of this as what we want to do is make sure that on behalf of ourselves and our owners that, we're not tying up inventory unnecessarily without customers having to take any risk or have any cost, but we have to migrate a behavior from where it is to where we want it to be. And I think there's some really intelligent things that I think you'll see us start to do later this year to start to move customers down that journey of recognizing, yeah, if you want total flexibility, there is a price for that. And if you want a better price then you're going to have less flexibility. And there's a lots of ways we can sort of create boundaries around our pricing structures to be able to accomplish that and I think get to the same place with a little bit less of a brute force approach.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, Chris, just to follow up on that, there is I think valid concern that in any pockets of weakness or in any broad-based weakness, the repricing engines are going to lead to a lot of cancel and rebook behavior. How will you battle that? Are the initiatives you're talking about enough to really (41:09)?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think so. Yeah, I think so. You'll have to see and we'll have to see as we roll them out. But I think so, that with, I think a lot of people in the industry including us sort of changing our cancel policies to thwart some of the robo techno approaches to cancel and rebook that are going on. We've changed our policies. It used to be same day for everybody in the industry, now it's 24-hour. There are things that we can do and sort of extending that timeframe in addition to creating different types of pricing structures for more or less flexibility and I think the combination of those two things, David, if we're smart should accomplish the objective.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, how are you? One of your peers last week said that their RevPAR in January was up, I believe, a touch over 3% and they expected February to be slightly better than that. Can you give us any similar color? Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Similar, I mean we gave you our guidance of 2% to 4% for the quarter. January was basically 3%, very high 2%s, 3%. February, similar \u2013 similar, and we're hoping \u2013 January and February have seen transient trends in the mid-2%s. We do hope and are expecting March to have a bit of an uptick in the transient trends. So that's how we get to the 2% to 4%. But if you look at January and February, we're sort of running plus or minus 3%.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thanks. And then just in terms of 2016 U.S. RevPAR trend, you have a pretty diversified chain scale mix. How are you thinking about each chain scale? I mean, last year, you saw the inflection where the lower tier chain scales start to outperform the higher tier, but it sounded like in your prepared remarks there was some weakness in the fourth quarter and (43:22)?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And I've been saying this I think for about a year or more \u2013 and we started to see it last year. I don't think you're going to see a huge divergence by the way, I mean this is one of things, when RevPAR starts growing at a little bit lower level, things do converge, the spreads converge on one another. But I do think you'll see higher end outperforming lower end a bit. And the reason, I'm sure, is obvious to you guys, that really the group side, right, because the higher \u2013 lower end doesn't have much group business, which, given group position, is stronger, lower end is much more transient in orientation. So, I would expect and I would say is natural at this point in the cycle from my experience in prior cycles that you'll see upscale and above upper upscale really and above outperform everything below, just for the group factor if nothing else.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Chris, just a housekeeping question to start with. The timing of the filing of the Form 10?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Q2, where a lot of work going into it. We've done a ton of work. I'd hate to give an exact date, I mean we're \u2013 sometime in the second quarter, hopefully in the earlier part of the quarter than the later, but we'll see. It's a lot of moving parts coming together.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then a two-parter, and I'll be done here, on capital. I think there is a perception among the REIT investors in particularly that maybe you're, I think, you called them bellwether assets, need a lot of CapEx. So could you comment on that?","And then, as we've heard from other companies, there's certainly some challenges in the financing environment out there. Have you thought about whether you're going to increase your investment in unit growth through either increased key money, mezz loans, anything like that? That's it for me.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Yeah. I'm happy to cover both and Kevin may want to jump in, if I miss something. On the CapEx, on the big super tankers or broadly in the owned estate, we've invested a lot of money. And I think since 2007 and 2008, $2 billion into those assets. We've I think done a very good job of doing the core things. There was a lot of deferred maintenance in some of those assets just in terms of room renovations, basic meeting space, some of the public spaces. And we've done a ton of that work.","So I would say, my view is from a \u2013 sort of what I think the market worries about at least what I hear and I think implied your question is, as there are a bunch of huge deferred maintenance; no, there is not. We've spent, I mean on average, probably 8% of revenues or more, 8% to 10% of revenues on those assets.","Having said that, I do think there is lots of opportunities because we have been very focused on being capital-light. And so, as it relates to opportunities to invest in larger ROI or doing incremental investing that could drive returns, I mean not deferred maintenance but incremental to deferred maintenance that would drive even higher returns. Being perfectly honest, we have shied away from that, because even though that's a big part of the company, as a combined company that's just not \u2013 we're focused on the capital-light side of the business, we think investors want us focused on that. So we have not been deploying as much capital as we could have.","So I do think there's plenty of upside opportunity for a separate company that is going to be in the capital intensive business, by its very nature, and have an investor base that understands that, that actually is looking to make investments and allocate capital to get really, really strong returns on significant ROI opportunities. So that's how I would describe the capital. Kevin, anything to add to that?","And then on the financing, I'd say, we're not seeing or doing anything usual to stimulate our pipeline. We signed, as you heard me say, 100,000 rooms last year. We opened 50,000 rooms gross, 43,000 rooms net. I think, in key money and all investments, we spent under $25 million last year, something like that.","So, there is a lot of competition out there, et cetera, et cetera, but we don't see, at the moment, anything really material happening. I mean, with Tru, we've done 163 deals, and we have not spent one penny in key money or provided one penny of guarantees or one penny of mezz debt, one penny of anything, okay.","So, we are very focused on being capital-light and the good news is we can be, because I would say, I think we have the purest, highest quality brand portfolio in the business. We have 13 the best brands, each one of them either the market leader or a category killer. They're the most financeable brands out there. They're the most consistently high brands out there. And it is obviously resonating with the ownership community given that we have one in five of all hotels under construction in the world. We're fighting it four times or five times our weight in terms of our existing base of supply in the world.","So, I think, we've got really \u2013 I think we've got really good momentum on the development side and we \u2013 when it's necessary and it's strategic, we certainly have been willing to do small things. But it's a very small minority of ultimately the deals that we're doing.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","The next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you a question just a little bit on your guidance. You note that cash available for debt reduction and capital return at $800 million to $1 billion for the year. And I was just wondering, is there anything going on there maybe with cash taxes or some \u2013 or working capital, I just \u2013 it just seemed at least relative to our numbers like a little bit lighter than what we were looking for? And I was curious if you could add a little color around that.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Sure, Smedes, it's Kevin. I think not fully knowing what you're looking for and certainly Christian and Jill can take you through the modeling what you're doing. But I would say, relative to last year, we did $1.1 billion. And I think that you got to remember, we had a couple of capital transactions last year including one very large asset that we sold, that we used the entirety of those proceeds to pay down debt. So, if you look at it on a run rate basis, this year's free cash flow guidance range is higher than last year's. And that's how we think about.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then you had mentioned in the quarter that your franchise fees or management fees were a little bit higher due to some franchising relicensing, I think. I was just wondering if you could isolate that piece in the fourth quarter.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, I mean, it's just a \u2013 I mean, there are a couple of larger deals that happened in the fourth quarter and then it was just kind of volume, right. I mean, we're at \u2013 we're a pretty active part of the market for that sort of thing. So, we had good volume and we think we'll still have good volume this year; it's just some of the timing got pushed it into the fourth quarter versus the first quarter.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Wes Golladay or RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. When we look at Stop Clicking Around, I guess is that more U.S. focused marketing campaign? And what's the difference in rooms booked directly in the U.S. versus international?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is a global campaign in fact, at least in my history and I think probably in the history of company since just before I got here we put the company back together. And this is the first time we've done a global campaign that is activated in all forms of media, it's activated with all of our team members around the world every hotel. There's not a hotel that you'll go in, in our system, in the world where you won't see Stop Clicking Around.","There's not a team member that doesn't know about it. So, it is an all hands on deck Hilton Worldwide effort and will continue to be so. The ultimate objective is, as I stated, it's really \u2013 it's about having direct relationships with our customers why do we want that because we want them to have a \u2013 we want them to get the best value that they can get, get the best experience, and we obviously want to lower our distribution costs for both ourselves and our owners.","We're a couple weeks into it. So it's \u2013 maybe we can give you some stats next quarter, it's early days, but so far off the charts, meaning, we've had the highest levels of HHonors enrollments in our history and we've had some pretty high enrollment periods. We were up 50% in enrollments last year, but we're setting new records. We've had the highest level of web activity that we've ever had on our websites, more downloads on our app than we've ever had, and historically high revenues coming booked through the app.","So, it's working. I think people are getting the idea that the best value and the best experience is going to come through being an HHonors member and booking through our channels. So big and global and this will be a drumbeat you're going to continue to see. Obviously, a big burst at the beginning, but you're going to continue to see a drumbeat for a very long period of time.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. I look forward to the updates.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thanks. Most of mine have been answered, but just a quick one. I wanted to take a step back, and think about the fee business on a standalone basis. I know you have a relatively higher exposure to franchise fees versus some of your peers. So how should we think about kind of longer term fee growth trajectory of your fee business? And then also maybe the durability of your fee stream in various market conditions?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, I hate to retreat to, we'll give you more later but \u2013 we'll give you more later. No, we are going to, when we file our Form 10s, give individual analysis and strategic thinking about each of the businesses, and break it apart in a granular way, so that you can understand that. I think a couple of things that we've talked about, and so you'll get a lot of information.","I think the way to think about our fee business is, it's got tremendous growth potential both same-store and obviously new unit growth, and new unit growth is easy. We're leading in organic new unit growth, and my job \u2013 our job is to continue to do that, and we expect that we will. So that's going to add to the profile of the growth.","In terms of the existing fee base, I think it's in a really good place in terms of having tremendous upside potential at a much lower beta. And I say that because a large part of it, I think it's something like 70% of the existing fee business which you can see without further disclosure, is in the franchise space, which means we have tremendous growth potential in that, but it's a lower volatility fee stream. We also have opportunities to continue to move those fees up. We have \u2013 our sort of market level of fees on average is about 5.5 and growing on average and we are now only at 4.7. So, we have opportunities to continue to move those fees up on our management business.","We do have incentive management fees and lots of upside potential there. We've been growing those obviously in the 15% to 20%, before FX and increasing. The way to think about our incentive management fees is, it's very different than some of our competitors, because, number one, it's a lesser part, so lower volatility, it's 10% of our overall fee base growing at a nice rate, and 80% of it is in the international arena and the very large bulk of those deals do not stand behind owner priorities which is quite different than I think some of our competitors, particularly in an environment where things might slowdown and you have cliffs that you go over where you go under an owner's priority and fees go from something to nothing.","We don't really have that, almost all of our deals that we participate first dollar of profitability and there is no cliff. So I think, it's actually \u2013 again, we'll give more detail, I know I just threw out a bunch of stats and we'll be happy to work with folks at the appropriate time that model it. But I think the way to think about it is, between the structure of what we have same store, new unit growth, tremendous growth potential but a lower beta business at the same time than some of our competitors.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then finally just, could you comment on the quarterly cadence of what you're seeing in your group bookings?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think \u2013 for the full year, I think, first quarter is strong, second quarter less so. I think it's first and third quarter strongest is my recollection, second quarter a little less, and fourth quarter is always \u2013 fourth quarter is a smaller quarter for the group side.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","The next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask \u2013 I know that a lot of the detail is going to be in the filling. But when you look at properties that are going into the REIT versus those that aren't, I guess we had thought about maybe 80% of your owned and leased being \u2013 80% of that being owned, but you're only putting in 70 properties of the 124 properties that are wholly owned and leased. Can you maybe sort of just give us some philosophy behind what's not going to go into \u2013 go in the REIT? And then....","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","...also \u2013 go ahead.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, that's a great question. And yes, I can give you some philosophical view and then we'll provide the granular detail. I think what we've tried to do, as I said, is set up every one of these companies for a success. So, what we've thought about is there are both structural issues, of course, with what goes where, but we've tried to set up the REIT in a way that will be appealing to the REIT investor base, which means that it is \u2013 wants to be largely U.S. domestic assets, which thankfully we have a lot of those. There is \u2013 there will be a small complement of international assets where it makes sense. But it will be a very small minority of the overall company.","Where we've left assets in or going to leave assets in OpCo has to do with some international where having long-term control of those assets makes sense for OpCo because it's how it will control its tenure. And then leases, particularly the international leases, are largely if not entirely left in OpCo because that is, number one, doesn't really work or fit within a REIT; and number two, it is the means by which we control our tenure, given the structure of how those were set up in the international estate and we want to be able to control our tenure. So that's philosophically how we did it, set each company up for success, make it very attractive to REIT investors and allow OpCo to continue to control its destiny on certain assets, particularly leased assets that are controlled under those structures for the long term.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And, Robin, I'd just add that, in terms of economics, this is factual that we've talked about before about the existing company is. Our top 10 assets are 50% of the EBITDA of the segment. Our top 20 assets are two-thirds of the EBITDA of the segment. So, no commentary on what's going to be in or out, but I think you can get a sense for the economics versus the asset split from those stats.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. That's very helpful. Thanks. And if I could ask part two of my one question, as everyone is.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Chris, you commented on the three things that are most important when running a REIT and one of them you talked about was the timing of whether \u2013 knowing whether it's time to buy or sell assets. So I guess I'd love to hear your view on whether you think right now it's time to buy or sell?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I actually would say right now is the time to probably do nothing, not to be trite about it. I think right now is the time \u2013 I do not think, with the uncertainty in the world, that it's a great time to go out and buy. I also don't think it's a particularly great time to sell, because the markets have really \u2013 capital markets for those kinds of transactions, debt markets, have slowed down.","So there are times in the REIT world where the best thing to do is really hunker down and really drive the value of what you have. And if you're going to buy anything, I'd be buy what you know best, buy your own shares in an environment where they're significantly undervalued. I think now is one of those times.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rich Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just one question here. I want to hit on one of Chris' earlier comments in the prepared remarks about organic growth opportunities in the real estate portfolio and I think you answered part of the question in the CapEx discussion in terms of potentially pursuing ROI projects that haven't been done to-date. But also were there previously internal resource allocation questions or things like revenue management or group production that might be improved upon when the real estate portfolio is spun out separately?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think specifically, but I would say this, we've certainly had, I think, a very full asset management approach to these assets and I think our operators have worked well with our asset managers to drive good results. I think reality is, if being \u2013 I told you my three pillars, asset management, managing the balance sheet, and capital allocation, have we dedicated as a big operating company where the thrust of our growth has really been in the management franchise segment, have we allocated capital or G&A, if you will, to having a super robust asset management team with every resource available? The truth of the matter is, no. That's not to say we, I think, have been irresponsible in any way, we haven't. We have allocated capital the way we thought we would get the greatest return. So said another way, I think there are opportunities as this company becomes independent and builds an even fuller asset management capability to drive better results. And we will be very pleased to be working with them as a partner, a long term partner to do that.","Rich Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Thanks, Chris. That's all from me.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Katz of Telsey Group. Please go ahead.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi, good morning, all.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I wanted to just ask about specifically the timeshare business, because you mentioned that as a free standing business, it can grow in a more natural way, and we've certainly observed what's happened when a competitor of yours spun-off theirs , and we've seen other entities start to grow? And I wonder how you think about that timeshare business as a competitive landscape? Is there a point at which those entities can compete with each other?","And since the one question rule seems to have fallen by the wayside, I wanted to ask about the shared economy, and it's become an increasingly focused upon issue within branded hotel environments and how you envision something like that fitting into your business today and then in the three parts, all using the same brand, and I'm referring to the sort of Airbnb type model? Thank you.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","All right. So, David, I'll take timeshare first and then probably hand it over to Chris for sharing economies. So, I think, the way we think about it is our timeshare business has been a really strongly performing business for a long period of time, its top line revenue has more than doubled since we've been here at the company since 2007. The way it's done that is it has transformed itself to a capital-light business. We've singed up 11 fee-for-service deals, and we've significantly built our inventory such that it's been effectively growing in good times and bad, it continued to grow through the Great Recession.","So we don't think any of that changes, it's going to be set-up for success. I think what Chris referenced before is it may allocate capital in a slightly different way, and I think that what that's going to enable it to do is, at times when it makes sense to maybe lean in a little bit more on capital, whether that's buying back inventory or investing in new projects, it will have the ability to that, because it's going to have a shareholder base that thinks about capital allocation slightly differently.","That said, I don't think it ever goes back to the way it was, when we got here where we were spending $0.5 billion a year building timeshare towers. We permanently transformed this business under Mark's leadership and with our capital allocation efforts to where it's set up for success and I don't think it's going to \u2013 we don't expect it to perform any differently out on its own than it has been with us other than maybe a little bit...","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I would say...","Kevin J. Jacobs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","...a little bit higher tolerance for capital allocation.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And as a result, David, I'd say, we think that HGV can grow its bottom line a bit faster on its own than with us. Simply because, even though, Kevin is right, we are not going back, we are going to continue to lean in to being capital light.","There is some, I think relatively modest incremental capital allocation that would be made to the business that, that investor base would understand and appreciate, that will help grow the bottom line a little bit faster. And those were investments that we did not want to make. We wanted to, again, be capital light. We did not \u2013 we wanted to allocate a minimum amount of capital to that or any capital intensive business as a consequence of having those businesses tied to the management franchise business. By delinking them, I think it allows them to allocate a little bit more capital and grow a little faster.","And then on Airbnb, I mean, I certainly have answered the question. Exactly \u2013 I was trying to figure out exactly the tack. We talked about this quite extensively on the last call. Can you maybe refine the question a little more on what exactly you're asking?","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yeah. What are you doing today and what are you planning to \u2013 what strategies have you added since the last time you discussed or answered the question, in terms of evaluating that as a business and whether it belongs within your branded system or not?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't think we talked that. I don't really have a different view than \u2013 David, than we talked about last time. I think Airbnb's a real business, I suspect going to be around a real long time. I do think it is satisfying, I mean, it's a business that frankly has been around for thousands of years, that is becoming very, very efficient. I do think it is meeting demand that customers want. I think it's a different product that they're delivering on than what we deliver on. And in the sense that it is generally longer stay, leisure, and value oriented. That is not generally what we do. I think we have lots of products, we take a physical product and wrap it in a lot of hospitality and in a lot of service which I think is very different.","So I think there is ample opportunity, as I thought on the last call, for us to coexist. I think we believe that these are different businesses. There is overlap in our customer base. We don't see any material impact from it. I think testimonial to that is that the industry is at the highest levels of rates and occupancy that we've ever seen in history.","So we certainly have not been suffering. There's no sort of scientific data that would say that we're suffering. I think there's plenty of opportunity for us to coexist for them to do what they do best and for us to do what we do best.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thanks for taking my questions.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. How are you? One thing I was confused about just some of the assumptions that go into your 1Q RevPAR guidance of 2% to 4%. I want to clarify something. An earlier question you answered, you had said that for January and February you were currently tracking plus 3% for RevPAR, is that correct?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. I guess my confusion or where I'm not following is, we know that March is going to be a really tough comp month, how \u2013 what do you assume to get to the high-end of your RevPAR guidance or even your midpoint here because it seems a stretch in my opinion?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, we \u2013 I don't really know quite how to answer that in a sense that we've said it's 2% to 4%, so we think we're going to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We've been running 3%, maybe a slight bit less than that. We do think transient trends are going to be a little bit stronger in March based on the booking trends that we see right now and I would say we feel good about being within that range. Exactly where we'll be, we'll obviously come back and report after the fact.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And with no further questions, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta, President and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional or closing remarks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've probably taken enough of your time today. So, I'll just say thank you for spending the time with us. As I started out by saying I think we're going to have an exciting year in 2016. We still feel good about where our fundamentals are. We're very excited about the momentum we have in the development side of the business that add to our growth. The spins are going to \u2013 are complicated, but I think long-term we're going to create a tremendous amount of value. We'll look forward to telling you what's going on in the operating environment when we get together next and we'll look forward to giving you lots more detail on our Form 10, which I know based on all the questions everybody is interested in getting here in the not too distant future.

Please note, this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.","Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton's second quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.

You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be able to report another strong quarter. RevPAR growth of 4% was at the high end of our guidance range, which drove bottom line growth ahead of our expectations. We continued to deliver across all major regions, segments, and areas of the business. Both U.S. and international markets contributed to great results.","Leisure and corporate transient each grew roughly 3% in the quarter, and group RevPAR meaningfully outpaced expectations, increasing high single digits year-over-year in the quarter. Our performance continues to demonstrate the benefits of a simplified model as well as geographic and changed skill diversification. The result is a high quality fee stream that generates significant free cash flow and enables us to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy.","Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders, or roughly 6.5% of our market cap. This includes participation in both HNA and Blackstone's recent secondary offerings, during which both fully exited their positions in Hilton. For the full year, we now expect to return a total of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.","Turning to our outlook, group position remains up in the mid-single digits for the full year and into 2019, and booking pace in the quarter for all future periods was up in the low double digits. Positive macro trends continue to support favorable industry fundamentals with forecasts calling for economic growth in every major region of the world through 2019.","In the U.S., economic indicators are modestly up versus prior expectations. Given synchronized global growth and particularly good trends in corporate spending, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 3% to 4% for the full year 2018, and bottom line results modestly ahead of prior expectations.","Our ability to deliver growth ahead of the broader industry is the result of our disciplined development strategy. We're committed to putting the right brands in the right locations at the right time. Our disproportionate share of the global pipeline relative to our existing size continues to illustrate the success of this approach.","In fact, signings for the full year are on track to hit our 110,000 rooms, surpassing our 2017 record levels and providing a solid base for continued long-term growth. This is up versus prior expectations, boosted in part by tremendous growth across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, where total signings are on pace to increase more than 40% year-over-year.","Additionally, conversion signings are up more than 60% versus last year, meaning we'll be adding even more iconic properties to our portfolio, including the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas. Due to open in early September, this marks the brand's entry into another important and dynamic market.","All of this is driving a record pipeline, which totaled over 360,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, representing 9% year-over-year growth and an industry-leading 41% of existing room base. Year-to-date, we've opened approximately 23,000 net rooms, up 8% versus the prior year, and remain on track to deliver roughly 6.5% net unit growth for the full year.","We had several notable openings in the quarter, including the Hilton Santa Barbara Beachfront Resort and the Hilton Dalian Golden Pebble Beach Resort. With signature restaurants and each boasting nearly 20,000 square feet of meeting space, these stunning properties are fantastic additions to our resort portfolio.","On the loyalty front, we added more than 3 million new Hilton Honors members in the quarter, bringing our total program to approximately 78 million members. With consistently strong growth, we are well-positioned to hit over 100 million member target by our 100-year anniversary next summer.","Additionally, members are more active and engaged than ever before. Honors share of occupancy increased 120 basis points in the quarter to nearly 60%, and members have unlocked over 25 million doors to date using digital keys at more than 3,600 properties.","To win on customer experience, we are incredibly focused on innovation. Technology, coupled with data and analytics, play an important role on our ability to truly personalize every step of the customer journey to drive more guest loyalty. From industry first launches, like Connected Room and our partnership with SHOWTIME to continuous Hilton Honors enhancements and offers, we're leveraging important tools to give our customers the choice and control they want from their travel experiences.","We also look for ways to innovate across other areas of our business. In April, we announced new 2030 goals as part of our Travel with Purpose corporate responsibility strategy. Through this initiative, we committed to cut our environmental impact in half and double our investment in social impact. Our sustainability efforts have already saved $1 billion in operating efficiencies since 2008. Overall, we're very happy with our performance in the quarter and feel very good about the setup for the rest of the year.","The macro environment continues to provide favorable industry dynamics and we continue to execute on an industry-leading development strategy while delivering unique guest experiences, all of which should continue to drive strong shareholder returns.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give a little bit more details on our results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Kevin?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 4% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis, achieving the high end of our guidance range.","Growth was driven by both occupancy and rate gains and benefited from the timing of Easter. As Chris mentioned, we saw solid performance across all major geographies and all business segments.","Adjusted EBITDA of $555 million exceeded expectations, increasing 10% year-over-year. Outperformance was largely driven by better-than-expected fee growth.","In the quarter, management and franchise fees increased 11% to $547 million ahead of our 7% to 9% guidance range due to RevPAR gains, better-than-expected license fee growth, as well as some timing items that we expect to reverse later in the year. Diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $0.70, achieving the high end of our guidance range.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 3.5%, led by strong group demand, particularly in company meetings and convention business, and better-than-expected results at our luxury resorts. Revenue from international inbound travel also helped results, growing over 8% in the quarter, due largely to increases from China, Europe, and Canada.","For full year 2018, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, given better-than-expected group business and corporate transient trends.","In the Americas, outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR grew 6.5% versus the prior year, given a mix of strong convention and corporate transient demand trends across Canada and broader market strength across the Caribbean and South America. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR in the region to grow in the mid-single-digit range.","RevPAR in Europe grew 6.3% in the quarter, roughly 100 basis points ahead of our expectations. Broader strength in Turkey coupled with increased demand in Russia related to the World Cup helped drive results.","For the full year, we continue to expect RevPAR in Europe to grow in the mid-single-digit range as strong trends across Continental Europe are somewhat tempered by softer transient performance in the UK.","In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR was roughly flat as softening leisure and group demand in the U.A.E. offset improving trends in Egypt. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be within our system-wide guidance range.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 7.3% in the quarter, partially driven by strong leisure demand across resort properties. RevPAR in Greater China grew more than 11% in the quarter with occupancy increasing over 8%.","For full year 2018, we continue to expect RevPAR for the Asia Pacific region to grow in the high single-digit range, with RevPAR growth in China of 12% to 13%.","Moving to our guidance, for full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of 3% to 4% consistent with our last call, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.07 billion to $2.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint.","Guidance is modestly higher factoring for the second quarter beat with some offset from FX and timing. We forecast diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $2.64 to $2.71.","For the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2.5% to 3%, slightly lower than our full year range due to July 4 and Jewish holiday shifts. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $560 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $0.71 to $0.76. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate incremental share repurchases.","Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter, bringing year-to-date dividends to $92 million, and have returned a total of approximately $1.6 billion year-to-date. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter.","For 2018, we now expect to return between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our second quarter results and our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up related to your question.","Denise, can we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, Mr. Jacobs. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question this morning will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please, go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hello, and first question just relates to the sequentially lower third quarter RevPAR outlook. To what degree is that entirely related to the holiday shifts or to some degree are you being cautious possibly because of potential weakness caused by the trade war?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It is the former, not the latter, but maybe worthy of a little bit of commentary to give a little bit more color to perspective on fundamentals, which I suspect will continue to come up. So, I'd say, by and large, we feel really good about the fundamentals, and it's driven by exactly what you would expect, and that is the basic setup of supply and demand.","Demand is growing at a decent pace for whole a bunch of reasons around the world. Here in the U.S., I think still benefiting from post-Tax Reform world where a lot of cash is going back into the system, a lot more investment is occurring, corporate profitability is growing, and companies are spending more money. And so demand is growing. Supply, I think, if you look at all the data has sort of hit a point where it's diminishing.","So, I think this year will be the peak in supply in the U.S. that 2% every expectation that it's going to go down. So, we're benefiting and so the statement of the obvious, we're benefiting from the laws of economics when demand is growing better than supply. I think that's going to continue for a period of time. How long? We don't know, but certainly we feel confident about this year. And honestly, we feel confident about the setup going into next year.","On the last call, technically we gave guidance of 2% to 4%, I guess, in the written form. But on the call, we provided an overlay, which was I felt like we'd probably do more likely 3% to 4%, and that was on the basis of the beginning of some decent trends that we were starting to see in a couple of areas of the business, importantly business transient and the group side, and that we were optimistic in what we were seeing and hopeful that those would continue.","The good news is they have, okay? So, when I look at the three big segments of our business, leisure transient has been strong over the last bunch of years, and it continues to hang in there nicely.","If you look at business transient, last year, I've said it many times, it was, I would argue, very weak because of a lot of uncertainty in the broader economic environment. We, at the beginning of this year, started to pick up. In the second quarter, we clearly saw a continuation of that trend and we're seeing it now, and we expect to continue to see it throughout the rest of the year. And I think group somewhat speaks for itself in our prepared comments. Q2 is very strong. But we're seeing basically an improving trend in the group side.","So, I think, there are lots of good reasons for optimism. I feel very good about the rest of the year, and frankly, I feel very good about the setup going to next year. So, then why Q3 and Q4, and why the second half of the year, which I've read a bunch of the analyst reports that seems where everybody's focused on?","We're year-to-date 3.9%. We guided 3% to 4%. So, that implies some lower level of expectation for the second half of the year. I'll cover both, the third and the fourth quarter. Third quarter, Harry, I know this is more than you asked, but all this needed to be said.","Third quarter is really holiday shift. I mean the 4th of July fell on the worst day of the week it can fall on. When it falls on a Wednesday, it blows the whole week apart. My guess is nobody on this call was traveling for business that week, nobody in this room was, and nobody on Earth it seems, well, nobody in the United States anyway was.","So, you have a very weak start to the quarter. You end the quarter in a weak way in the sense that Jewish holidays are moving both day of week and within the month, moving up to a more impactful time, and that when we look at the math, that's all that's happening. If you sort of as best we can cleanse for those things, things are moving along just fine. All of the optimism that we had in my earlier commentary about the various segments holds true as we go into the second half of the year.","Fourth quarter is just a matter of honestly \u2013 maybe a touch of conservatism honestly, that is based on the fact that the comps are harder, and those are partly driven by the weather comps. All the hurricane activity did create an updraft in results in the fourth quarter. You also were starting to get the early benefits from some of the passage of Tax Reform and clarity around tax policy in the United States, which gave a bit of a boost.","And so, I will be the first to say, as we look at that, third quarter I think is reasonably, because it's upon us and we've already experienced 4th of July, I think that's reasonably easy to forecast. Fourth quarter is harder. Those things are little bit more difficult to pin down. So, there could be a touch of conservatism built into that. But I would not want to leave anybody with the impression that we somehow think things are weakening because of trade wars or anything else.","We feel pretty darn good for the reasons I described about what's going on with the underlying business. I've actually sat here with our team, preparing for this, and as I do every Monday morning, and I'll stop on this, and asked are we seeing any impact of the sabre-rattling that's going on, on the trade wars in any of our markets? Are we seeing any patterns of bookings, either business transient, leisure, or group in particular? Are we seeing any impact in our China business on the development side, on the operating side? And so far the answer is we are not seeing anything that we can measure.","And I think things are progressing as they have been and we feel good about the remainder of the year. And as I said, we feel pretty darn good about the setup, all things being equal, for next year.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Very good and quick one for Kevin. Can you just walk us through the sequential lift in G&A? My guess is that much of that is non-cash, but probably requires a little bit more detail.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Harry. As you point out, it is largely non-cash and largely below EBITDA. So, it's really three things. The implementation or the effect of the new accounting standard related to pension accounting moves some benefit from out of G&A and into another below the line item. There's some FX in there and then a little bit of stock comp, and that's it.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. That's it for me. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you for the exhaustive answers to the first question, Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sorry about that. I answered now that everybody wanted to ask that, Joe. So now, I have answered everybody's question.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So to add on that slightly, when you think about your three major buckets, leisure and corporate transient and group, which do you see as the relative outperformers in the second half, given the relative outperformance of group versus the other two in the 2Q?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think for the second half of the year and for the full year, you will ultimately see group outperform all segments. It will probably go group, leisure transient, business transient. So group will be the outperformer. It has been in the first half of the year. I think it will be in the second half of the year.","I think leisure transient, business transient year-to-date, and best that we can forecast, will be pretty darn close, but I think leisure will eclipse it by a bit. The most important point in that though, and I covered it a bit in my soliloquy there a few minutes ago, is that business transient is much better than it'd been.","Last year, you were talking about 1%, 1.5% if you were lucky. This year, I think for the full year we expect it to be more like 3%, so a material uptick from where we were.","Leisure has been strong. So, leisure is going to be likely about where it's been the last couple years, and then group is going to be realistically 4%-plus. So, figure transient will be 3%-plus a little bit maybe, and group will be 4%-plus a little bit in the end.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, Kevin, a quick follow-up; what was the diluted share count at the end of the quarter, the absolute diluted share count, not the average?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, hold on one second, Joe. I just don't want to give you the wrong number; 303 million.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's the average or the absolute share count at the quarter end?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's weighted average. Oh, you want the absolute?","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, what it was at June 30.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I don't have that in front of me, Joe. I'm sorry. We'll get it to you.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. Thank you, both of you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hold on. We got it. What is it?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","298 million.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","298 million.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning, and thanks for taking my question.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Morning.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You guys spoke and, Chris, you provided some helpful color around the build in the pipeline. If I recall earlier in the year, maybe the outlook on signings in the year was a little bit down from I believe the number was 108,000 last year. With the exception of some of the strength you've seen in Europe, and the strength in conversion activity that you referenced, is there anything else that you're seeing in the trajectory of your signings and development overall that has you more or less encouraged than maybe last time we spoke?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think you covered the big ones. Europe and the Middle East were very helpful. Conversions obviously are a big focus in a tightening lending environment. So, we're pleased with that. I'd say the other thing that has outstripped expectations, particularly in an environment where construction costs have been going up at a very high rate. I think the number that I got last week was from our team is that year-to-date construction costs have gone up 7% or 8%, and that's off of a 10% increase last year.","And so, you have cost going up in an environment where lending standards have tightened, and while RevPAR is growing, it's not growing enough to keep up with that. And so, you've seen, obviously, a decline in what's going on in the U.S. So, we started the year, all that being said, feeling like in the U.S. we would sign fewer deals. We would get more than our fair share given the strength of the brands and the market share of the brands, but that the whole market was going to go down.","In reality, what looks like is going to happen based on our forecasting at this point is the whole market's going to go down in terms of signings so we're going to be relatively flat in the U.S. So, that's how we're doing better is we'll be probably down a little bit, but not as much. So, Europe, Middle East up, Asia Pacific doing fine, the U.S. maybe down, but very modestly, and down less than we would have thought.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you. That's helpful. And then if I could just one follow-up on the same topic. As you look at the pipeline and you look at kind of your under construction right now, and you kind of extrapolate out to 2019, is there the potential then to see somewhat of an acceleration in your net unit growth in 2019 relative to the 6.5% you're guiding to for 2018?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No. We get that question a lot. I think as we said at our Investor Day a couple of years ago, and I've said pretty consistently, we're really comfortable in the 6% to 7% range when we look at all factors. There are dynamics that have certainly changed over the last couple years, since we sort of gave that range in terms of what's going on in the U.S. As I just described what's going on in Europe, what's going on in Asia Pacific, it's a dynamic situation.","But when we look at it overall, I think that we're in that zone for the next few years, and when we look at what's under construction, we look at the opportunities in the conversion world. And we look at building off a higher base because every year that goes by, we're getting bigger and it gets harder. That's sort of the range that we're comfortable with. I would not want to guide people to 7% or above.","Having said it, it's not impossible, but I want to be clear in saying that is not where we would guide you. We're going to end up in the middle of the range this year and I think everything is sort of lining up in terms of what we think that's under construction that's going to deliver next year, and what we think we can drum up in conversion activity to put us in that same range. So, hopefully, obviously, we always want to be to the mid to the high point of that range. But I think it will be within that range.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. This is I guess a follow-up to that line of questioning. So, you mentioned rising construction cost, tightening financing markets. At the same time, it seems like we keep hearing that the transaction environment for existing hotels has been heating up and perhaps valuation moving a little bit higher. What do you think is driving that dichotomy and what are the ramifications kind of going forward for your pipeline as you kind of put down your brand on that?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think it's those things that are driving it combined with one other, which is that the debt markets for existing assets are incredibly fluid right now. So, debt markets for new construction are much more limited. Cost to build has gone up at a high rate. So, what do people do? They want to be active transactionally. They're looking at a cost to build going up and cost to buy that could potentially be lower than a cost to build, and it's very financeable. So, it's not at all surprising that you would see more transaction activity. We're seeing more change of controls. My expectation is in this environment you're going to continue to see more of that.","Implications for our pipeline are, as you can see, this has been happening over the last couple of years. I think our expectations we're going to continue to grow the pipeline. We need to continue to grow the pipeline in order to deliver the 6% to 7% net unit growth, and I would say notwithstanding the fact that the U.S. will I think continue to be under pressure in the sense of development activity broadly slowing down. And even though we'll get more than our fair share of it, it will be hard to fight that trend. It's a big world and that's the whole point of being strategic about how we deploy resources around the world that things move in different rhythms around the world. And as much as things are slowing down here, there's still tremendous opportunity for us in other parts of the world, notably in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa and clearly in Asia Pacific.","And so, this is in my now coming up on 11 years that I've been here looking at the stats, we've seen this cycle. This will be the third time we've effectively seen this cycle, where U.S. goes up, U.S. goes down. Things come up and down. And we I think then try to be very strategic and I think have demonstrated I think our ability to be successful in an environment that's dynamic by making sure that we're taking advantage of opportunities elsewhere.","So, you're going to see the U.S., look at all the Smith Travel numbers and lodging kind of metrics and everybody's numbers, they all show that supply numbers are going down in the next couple of years. And I think they're all right for the reasons that we talked about. But good news is the world's a big place and I think we've set ourselves up very well to continue to be able to be quick on our feet and make sure that we're continuing to grow at a great pace.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. And I guess as an unrelated follow-up, I think it's been a little bit over a quarter maybe in two with the new credit card programs we launched, I guess what are you seeing from the consumer in terms of signups and usage following the introduction?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, so far so good, Stephen. It's still, again, it's still early days, but the cards are being well received by consumers and they do drive, well, more hotel use and more spend in our system overall once people signup for the card. So, all good so far there.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please, go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe to stick with the discussion around kind of pipeline, and what's going on there, you mentioned the conversion activity. I think you said, the numbers are quite strong in the quarter. Could you just help us break out a little bit more of like kind of the economics there? So, like how much shorter are these typically in the pipeline? And then, what's sort of driving the independents' decision to kind of affiliate right now, and just sort of what's the value proposition on their end?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Shaun, it's Kevin. Well, to start off with the easy one, on average, convergence end up being in the pipeline for around six months, so much shorter delivery time, and that's for obvious reasons because the hotel doesn't have to get built.","I'd say, what's driving overall \u2013 the question from before around transaction activity tends to drive a better environment for conversions. You just have more contracts that become available on a sale, or more often than not, a new owner might have a different perspective on which brand they want to affiliate. So, it tends to drive \u2013 an active transaction environment tends to drive more conversion activity.","And then the independent to branded trade is just around the power of the network effect and our ability to drive market share. And yes, you're adding on fees. But if we can drive higher net revenue \u2013 net of the incremental fees, then we tend to find owners that want to affiliate with us. And that's been going on, and will continue to go on. But in my opinion at least, a healthier transaction environment can drive more conversion.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's right. I mean I think ultimately that we'll continue to see increases in volume, and the value proposition is our average market share in our systems are 114%, and most very rarely with independent hotels drive that kind of market share. And so, we have an ability to drive revenues. We also, even though almost all of these end up being franchise, not all of them, but the bulk of them, we have a very positive impact on their cost structures, notwithstanding the fact they got to pay us. They get it back in share and they get it back in distribution cost efficiencies, because the traditional independent hotel becomes very, not all, but most, very heavily reliant on OTA business, and they pay a lot higher exchange rate than we do.","So, they get to not only come into the system and get the benefit of all of the direct relationships we have with customers, but for the much lower percentage of the business, they do depend on the OTAs for they pay a lot less for it. So, you get higher market share, top line, much greater efficiency in distribution cost, and they can afford to pay us and make a lot more money.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just as a follow-up because I think this topic's relevant, just like as distribution costs are becoming just an ever more clear discussion, and obviously the large brands like yourself are doing I think a better job of breaking these out and helping owners themselves, kind of really think about the economics here. Does this discussion come up more as a bigger sticking point than it was three, five, 10 years ago in your experience around kind of the conversion conversation? How focused are potential signups and conversions on the distribution piece of the equation?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","By the way, I wouldn't say it didn't come up five or seven years ago. It did. But it is a significant part of the discussion in almost every case now in a really positive way for us, in the sense that we are delivering so much of the revenue centrally through our systems and we are not dependent in the same way as others or certainly independents on the intermediaries. And because of our scale, we have a good deal where we do depend on it. And so, this is clearly part of the equation.","I'd say, Kevin's point is right. It generally starts with a market share. I'd say it's in the order that I talked about it. First and foremost is people are trying to drive top line, and then a very close second is the distribution cost discussion. Obviously, we compare generally quite favorably to their existing setup.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please, go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning, and thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. So, I just had a couple of questions related on your international business. First, you guys outperformed the STR data in Europe, and a lot of us were pretty focused on the slowdown we saw in Italy and Spain in the quarter, just in the industry data. So, I'm just wondering if you could help us understand what's going on there and talk about your outperformance in the market.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I mean of course the outperformance because we're better, kidding. Well, we hope we are better. We are driving...","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","(37:00).","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","The reality is that our outperformance, kidding aside, in the quarter was that we had massive share gains. Frankly, we had massive share gains. We had share gains across the board in every major region of the world. Our share gains in APAC and EMEA were outstanding. And so, our outperformance versus the market is because of our strength of the brands, market share, and commercial strategy. So, a big thanks to all of our teams that are helping drive these strategies.","If you look at it, I know there's been a lot of discussion about international slowing down, I've sort of had people asking me that it's not really what we're seeing. If you sort of just like whenever \u2013 quarter-to-quarter, there's always things sort of moving around that affect things. But if you look at the whole year, which cleanses not all, but most stuff, the international business for us, everything outside the U.S. for the full year is going to be almost exactly where we ended up last year. They will be made up a little bit differently, region, geography by geography, but when you look at it, it will be within a tenth of a point of where we ended up last year.","And so, what's really happening if you look at last year, we ended up at 2.5%, I need to take the midpoint of our guidance, we're saying we're going to be at 3.5%. Hopefully we do better. But that's what the midpoint of our guidance would be. It's basically the international performing almost identically last year, which of course was quite good, and the U.S. business is getting better, and that's the simple story of what's going on.","I said it I think on our last call. I mean the thing that we are really pleased to see over these last few years, I don't have the exact data points in my head, Kevin may, but if you look at what we've been doing over the last couple of years and the last few quarters in APAC and EMEA, for the first time ever, our market share numbers have eclipsed our U.S. market shares. And so, this is really a testimonial of the fact that the network effect is being built out outside of the United States and it's working.","Our U.S. market share is industry-leading on average. So, those are really good numbers. But in APAC and EMEA, our market share numbers are crushing it. And that is a wonderful testimonial to the work the teams are doing. But it's a great leading indicator when you talk about 40% \u2013 signings up 40% in EMEA. The reason it's happening is because the share numbers are growing like crazy and we're attracting more owner, attracting more capital by virtue of owners wanting to invest more in the system because they're seeing this and they want to invest to jump on the bandwagon, and invest with us to make more money.","So, certainly, we've had reason to believe good outperformance in the sense of gaining share over the last few years, and then second quarter was really, really big share. But I have an expectation, we'll continue to gain share as we go forward in the international stage.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. But your outperformance aside, is there anything going on in those two markets, Italy and Spain, just in terms of the data we saw in the quarter, or like you said should we just look at it more holistically in terms of the year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I'll be honest. I haven't studied Italy and Spain for the quarter. When we met with our teams, which I did across the globe last week, there was nothing that was pointed out to me that was anomalous stick in those markets or that whatever happened that won't sort of clear itself up by the end of the year.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then just my follow-up. So, you kind of just went through why you're outperforming. Just wondering and maybe getting a little bit greedy, how long do you think you can generate the RevPAR growth as mid to high single digits in Europe and Asia? And how far may you be from the prior peaks in terms of inflation adjusted pricing in some of those markets?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's of course really hard. I don't have that crystal ball. I think that those markets \u2013 let's take them one at a time. Europe is a big place, lots of different things going on. The UK has been a little bit weaker, being compensated for with strength in other parts of Europe, Germany in particular, Turkey coming off of easy comps and issues that have started to stabilize.","My expectation is that both as a consequence of sort of things being reasonably steady other than the Brexit situation, but reasonably steady in our ability to continue to drive commercial performance that we're going to drive better performance there than honestly we can drive here, even though U.S. is getting better, and Asia Pacific clearly, I think that will be the case just because I think the dynamic of those economies is even though we can debate China is growing a little bit slower and there are issues in Japan and the like in Southeast Asia, you could debate.","The reality is those as across the board, the Asian economy is going to be growing at a faster pace than most economies around the world for the foreseeable future, maybe slower than they have a little bit, but faster than the rest of the world. So, I think we're going to continue to see an ability to drive really good performance there. And if we do our job, we're going to outperform by continuing to have strategies that deliver incremental market share. So, I think for the next couple of years, I feel reasonably good barring unforeseen circumstances.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, and, Felicia, I'd just add, and it's not that you can't see a slowdown in Asia or anywhere in Asia, but outside of mature markets like Japan, prior peak is probably not the right way to think about it. In a lot of cases, we're still \u2013 it's an emerging market story...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","In mature markets.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","...and we're establishing these markets, especially in the middle market, where the business will continue to mature and rates will continue to grow, albeit within the context of economic cycles. But I'm not sure prior peak is the right way to think about it in Asia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, that's fair. Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. You made some positive comments around group production in the quarter. Can you just talk about your 2019 group base, and how it makes you feel about 2019? Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","2019 feels pretty good. So, I think the comment we made, we were up in the high single digits, low double digits for all periods forward in the quarter, all bookings forward on the group side, and into 2019. So, I think \u2013 I don't have the numbers sitting in front of me, but we're mid-single digits this year. I think we're mid-single digits, maybe even a little bit better, for next year. So, the group feels pretty good.","And frankly, if we look out, obviously, it's a diminishing percentage of bookings in terms of the overall bookings, ultimately that will occur in any year as you go forward to 2020, 2021, et cetera. But you look at the numbers in the next two or three years and they all look pretty good, and getting better.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please, go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. I just had a question on your 2018 guidance. With the RevPAR increase the midpoint, would it seem like maybe a higher EBITDA increase? And I know your fee growth rate for the full year didn't go up. I think you said maybe there were some factors in Q2 that were timing that wouldn't. They were maybe sort of borrowing a little bit from future quarters. But I know your SG&A went up a little higher, but even just at the EBITDA line, can you talk about what else might be happening on a full year basis where maybe we would have thought the RevPAR increase would have meant a little more of an EBITDA raise?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Robin. It's Kevin. First of all, the G&A increase is, like I said, largely non-EBITDA. So, that's really not having an impact. So, roundly, it's a pretty simple story. Of the $15 million beat, about a third or so of it was timing.","We've got about a $10 million lesser of a tailwind in the back half of the year from FX. So, that kind of gets you back to the same midpoint. And we increased the back part of the year by $5 million. So, that's really the story.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will be from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please, go ahead.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. I'm left with just a couple of small questions here (46:09). Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Any update on timing for the Waldorf? And are you collecting in New York and are you collecting any fees from that currently?","And then the second question is whether you have any commentary on the negotiations on the union contracts.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","In New York, the Waldorf Anbang continues to move ahead. But, first of all, we are not collecting any fees, zero fees. So, only upside when the Waldorf reopens. They are moving forward with all of the demolition work that needs to be done. They are moving forward with the contract documents for all the renovation, and they have said to us that when they complete those things, which they're working away at, they intend to execute on a plan for the renovation. I think the expectation is that's probably likely possibly late this year, I think more likely early next year.","I think it was reported publicly lately. So, it's consistent with what they've said to us. They are looking to sell a whole bunch of other U.S.-based assets, including, which was reported, the Strategic Hotels, but their intention was not to sell the Waldorf. That's what's been reported. That's what they've told us directly. So, they're moving ahead.","No real comment on union negotiations. We work really hard to maintain what we think is a very good and productive relationship with the unions, and different markets come up at different times where it's basically in a constant discussion with them on a whole bunch of different things, not just when contracts are up. So, nothing really incremental to report relative to that.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Chris, if I could just follow up on the Waldorf, I assume that's a three or four-year build-out process once they do get started. Is there any thought to...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, once they get started, it should be three. I don't think it's four. I guess it could, but because there's a lot of work to be done, but the building's there. You can't touch the \u2013 you got to clean up and improve the exterior, but the base building is there. So, you do take some of the timeline out because of that. But I think right now the schedule looks like three years or less.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Is there any thought on your part to opening another Waldorf in New York, a different part of New York, maybe just to have that presence?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Not at this time. Obviously, we're going to be opening another Conrad in New York, in Midtown here in the not too distant future. So, we'll have two Conrads in New York. But I think the idea is in New York, the Waldorf should be \u2013 the Waldorf Astoria in New York should be the only Waldorf Astoria in New York. If at some point \u2013 I do not expect this to be the case, but if at some point, it is clear that Anbang is not moving forward or it's going to be a significantly extended timeframe, then that's something that we would have to be intelligent about and consider.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Chris, I'm just quite curious about your thoughts on the cycle, specifically what does the shift in your net unit growth towards conversions and maybe a little bit away from development tell you about the future of net unit growth or components of RevPAR growth? Does it foreshadow a shift in your mind?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I don't think so, Jeff. I mean I think if I look at the \u2013 again, even in the 11 years I've been here sort of the cycle of what's going on with the pipeline, obviously our net unit growth has grown throughout that time. And the complexion of it has changed and the pipeline has changed a lot. But the patterns have been relatively consistent. And so I don't think it really foreshadows much of anything. I think it's back to what I said. It's a big world and there are lots of ways for us to be able to grow in ways that are great for our customers and giving them more opportunities to stay with us and great for all of our shareholders because we drive more profitability as we do it.","And so, conversions are one way we do that. It is largely a western experience. Although, there are some examples in other parts of the world where we \u2013 in the Middle East and Asia, where you will see us do some conversions. The bulk of it really will occur in the United States and Western Europe, and I think as a natural \u2013 it's a natural consequence of what's going on in the broader environment just in the U.S. as we've discussed, there's just less stuff getting built and I think independent hotels that have more I would argue more of an incentive in this environment to focus on trying to work with somebody like us and getting to the system to be able to drive greater profitability.","So, no, it's a long winded rambling way of saying I don't think there's anything particularly unique about what we're seeing in conversions. Conversions as an overall percentage of our NUG actually are still towards the lower end of the range. I mean if you go back in 2009 and 2010, coming out of the Great Recession, where you find conversions pick up a bunch, it was over 40% of our NUG. You look at it last year, it was roughly 20%. I think when we finish the year this year, it will be probably mid-20%s, maybe not even quite, but somewhere around 25%. So, it's still not in a relative sense compared to where I've seen it. It's still not anywhere near the high watermarks.","I think when you see \u2013 if and when, I mean I guess it's always when because business cycles eventually turn, although it doesn't certainly feel like that's happening anytime soon. When that happens, I think that's when you would see an incremental surge in activity and conversions because when times get much tougher, people look for shelter. And the fact that we have very high market share can drive more efficient distribution costs, works now really well and works even better when you're in a down cycle because people are even more focused on it.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I think all of that said, it will be hard for us to get back into sort of the mid-40%s in terms of percentage of conversions just because we have a much more mature development strategy today than we did back...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's fair. I mean I don't think we'll ever get there. Yes, that's a good add-on because I didn't mean to imply we would. That was in a different era for this company, much lower NUG, number one, just a much lower number, and number two, yeah, they have a much less mature development strategy. But I think in a down cycle, we clearly go up to a 30%. We can easily get to 30%. I doubt it would go a whole heck of a lot higher than that.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's useful. And just maybe a second question on pricing power. I know customers never relish paying more. But just the occupancy in the U.S. is near a about 20, 30-year peak and the ingredients are certainly there for an outsized response and rate growth to incremental demand that we're seeing particularly in certain markets. I was curious if you have any kind of anecdotes or experience that you're seeing right now around what the response has been from group and corporate customers to stomach price increases. I mean do you think there's a little bit of a delayed response either this year or maybe it increases next year? Just feels like the things hold together, we can see accelerating rate driven growth RevPAR and just wondering what feedback or how you think your customers are expecting that?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I mean I think the answer is yeah, I do think you're going to continue to see as you did last year and as I think you will this year in the U.S., the bulk of our RevPAR growth is coming in rate. It may not be supercharged rate growth, but I think last year and I think it will end up this year about the same play like 70% of our RevPAR growth is coming in the form of rate.","There's still weaker shoulder period weekends. We're getting occupancy even though it's at very high levels historically because I think we're a lot smarter about how to fill off peak times, which we want to keep doing. So in theory, if we get smarter and smarter, better at that, we're going to be able to drive some incremental occupancy all the time because we still have plenty of capacity in shoulder periods and particularly on weekends. No matter what we do, we still have capacity.","So, you always want to see a little bit of occupancy growth because we should be trying to fill every room we can. Rate growth is the bulk of it. I think you'll continue to see that. And yeah, here's what I'd say that if trade, sabre-rattling aside, you started out this year \u2013 ended last year, started out this year with a much more positive psychology in the business environment, people have a easier regulatory goal that they've got a lot \u2013 they have clarity on tax policy at least for now, they have a lot more dollars in their pocket to spend, they're investing it, just the psychology is better, the confidence is better. And in that environment, people are willing to spend more money. They're less rigid about, it gives you more pricing power just because also the economics, but also the psychology that they're just willing to spend more.","So, I do think if this momentum continues in the psychology and the business community is good as it has been, it will give you the ability to translate that into some incremental pricing power. You were starting to see it in a sense in \u2013 you could argue what we just described in the group space is the precursor to that, right, in the sense that you're seeing over the last two or three quarters a big uptick in the group space of people being willing to not only book in the moment for the moment groups, but out multiple years. What does that suggest?","That suggests this has more positive view in the business community about what the future holds. And I think that is a decent precursor to the fact that their confidence is going to translate into more spending, broader uptick in economic growth. And I think what goes with that is an expectation that you got to pay more for some products and services, including ours.","So, I don't want to get ahead of myself and saying it's going to be a bonanza, but I think, if this momentum continues, I do think it allows you to build incrementally just because of the laws of supply and demand a little bit of incremental pricing power. How much, it will depend on how much momentum, how much strength in the economy and for how long.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please, go ahead.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. You had gone over in length your thoughts of the no impact so far on bookings from the fears around trade war. How about the recent uptick in gas prices? Are you seeing any impact at all perhaps on your midscale brands for the summer leisure travel?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, we're really not, Pat. The U.S. consumer still feels pretty strong and I think everything is just fine on that front.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's it. Quick question. Thanks.","Operator","And the next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please, go ahead.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you, you talked about reaching 100 million Honors members, I guess, I think by next year. And you recently \u2013 a property in Jamaica changed hands and will move to an all-inclusive model. And just how are you thinking about expanding into that space particularly as you have more customers who presumably are going to want to use their points and the all-inclusive space seems to be gaining traction with consumers and are you just sort of seeing that you make as kind of a test case? Or what are your thoughts around that?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, it's a good question. We like the AI space in the sense we've been in it for a very long time in a fairly modest way in the sense that a number of our existing hotels largely centered on the Hilton brand, a little bit within the DoubleTree brand have had an all-inclusive sort of approach and pricing structure, including in Jamaica, but also in other parts of the world, in parts of Europe, in parts of the Middle East, Egypt resorts being one notable geography.","And so, we like it. We've been doing a bunch of work to figure it out, and I think the expectation is that we will \u2013 that is something that in certain locations, not broadly across the world, but in certain geographies, that is something that customers want. We do think it is a benefit from an Honors' point of view, because it's a place that Honors' numbers can redeem in too and a bunch of \u2013 enough of them want to do it.","So, I'm not going to make a big announcement on we're going to create an AI brand today. It's something we spend a lot of time on. I think you should expect to see us do more in that space. We are now figuring out exactly how we're going to do that. Exactly how we're going to do, it means how we're going to do it as we've been doing it with existing brands, and do it at a sort of higher volume, or would we create sub-brands within those brands that are purely focused on AI. And we don't, I'm being perfectly transparent, we don't have any answer to that yet, but you will certainly see us for I think all the right reasons those that you described, which is some customers want it. You'll see it doing more in that space, and more to come there over the next few months.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned some of the group booking patterns into next year. Have you seen any change, just given the way that group commissions are going to change through third-party bookings? Has that do you think accelerated any bookings or is that not really that meaningful overall?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, I mean that's very hard for us to track. I've asked that very question of my teams many, many times. As far as we can track and the best data I have, we don't think that there's been any material impact from the change in commission structure. My guess is there's a little bit of impact, just because naturally there should be and it's sort of hard to discern scientifically, so it's more atmospherically. But our folks think that the momentum is being driven by sort of the core underlying fundamentals of more positive psychology, just people feeling better, being willing to make decisions on bookings, because they're more confident about the future and not much to do about commission structures.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, everybody, for the time today.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Christian Charnaux, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, Mr. Charnaux.","Christian Charnaux","Thank you, Sharon. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide first quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we begin, we'd like remind you that our discussion this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our first quarter results and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the outlook for the remainder of 2014. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta","Thanks, Christian, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. Disciplined execution are the core strategies that we discussed on our last call and a clear focus on delivering long-term value for shareholders has resulted in another great quarter for the company. Strong top line revenue growth, flow-through and timeshare performance led to results that significantly exceeded our expectation. And as a result, we've raised our RevPAR, EPS and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Clearly, we continue to feel really good about the fundamentals of the business and our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'll spend a few minutes talking about that in just a bit.","First, let's talk more specifically about the first quarter results. Our system-wide comp RevPAR growth for the quarter was 6.6% on a currency neutral basis, driven by a 3.6% increase in average rate and a 1.9 percentage point increase in occupancy. In the quarter, we saw strong growth in both the group and transient segments. In fact, for the first time in many quarters, system-wide group revenue growth in Q1 outpaced transient revenue growth. Consistent with our view that we're at the midpoint of the cycle, group business continues to build with system-wide group revenue growth in the quarter of 7.4% year-over-year.","We're also starting to see meaningful increases in group ancillary spend, especially food and beverage. Banqueting revenue was up over 12% in our U.S. owned and managed hotels. And in our Big 8 hotels, group F&B spend per occupied room was up nearly 30% in the quarter and 13% in our U.S.-owned and managed hotels. This helped drive an overall increase in food and beverage revenue of almost 10% over the same time period in our U.S. owned and managed hotels.","Transient revenue growth remained strong as well, up over 6% across the system at comp hotels. This continued growth in transient demand, combined with strengthening group business, led to accelerating RevPAR growth for the quarter. Weather in the U.S. and the U.K. marginally affected Q1 RevPAR growth. However, this was largely offset by the timing of Easter.","Our strong top line performance, combined with our disciplined approach to managing costs, led to strong improvement in operating margins in the quarter. Our U.S. owned and operated hotels grew operating margins 157 basis points year-over-year, and our owned and operated hotels outside the U.S. grew operating margins 191 basis points on a currency neutral basis. This operating margin performance in our hotels, combined with overall management and franchise fee growth of over 17%, strong growth in timeshare EBITDA and continued corporate cost discipline led to strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter.","Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $544 million, an increase of 22% over the first quarter of 2013, and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 400 basis points versus first quarter of 2013. We also continued to make great progress on mining value enhancement opportunities embedded in our own portfolio, such as the new timeshare tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village that we announced last quarter. At the Hilton New York, we're planning a complete repositioning of the Sixth Avenue frontage of the property, which will create a retail platform with over 10,000 square feet of prime street-level space out of what today is a portico [ph] share. We expect construction of the retail platform to commence by the end of the year for completion in the first half of 2015.","We also plan to add additional timeshare inventory to the property, including 2 floors plus some unused penthouse space. Subject to regulatory approval, we expect interval sales to begin in the second half of the year, with units complete in the first half of 2015. We will fund both projects within the range of our CapEx guidance and expect steady-state incremental $6 million in annual EBITDA from the retail platform and a combined incremental NPV of the retail and timeshare projects of approximately $165 million.","Turning to some development highlights. As evidenced by the opening of over 9,000 rooms in the quarter, we continue to have great success in growing our system off the largest base of rooms, now with more than 686,000 rooms operating globally in 92 countries and territories. We have also approved 107 hotels, with over 15,000 rooms for development in the first quarter. We continue to be #1 in rooms under construction in every major region of the world, according to Smith Travel Research, with over an 18% share of all of rooms under construction globally.","Today, we have 510 hotels and approximately 101,000 rooms under construction that will soon be added to our system. We have also maintained our #1 pipeline ranking according to STR, with 1,165 hotels and approximately 200,000 rooms in 76 countries and territories. On a rooms basis, we have increased our pipeline by 13% over the last 12 months.","One signing I'd like to highlight is the new Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills, which is adjacent to the Beverly Hilton on the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevard. This 170-room luxury hotel will be the brand's first newbuild hotel in the West Coast. Our luxury brands continue their industry-leading growth with stunning purpose-built properties in marquee locations, such as the recently opened Waldorf Astoria Beijing, the Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, the Conrad in Dubai, and the Waldorf Astoria in Jerusalem. Most importantly, we continue to outpace our primary competitors in opening fee-paying rooms, increasing our system size in the quarter by 8,000 net rooms.","It's important to note that we continue to achieve this high level of growth with de minimis amounts of capital investment by us and without any acquisitions. Our capital-light premium growth is built on the strength of our brands, and we firmly believe that we have industry-leading brands that are a meaningful strategic advantage. Our portfolio of brands is diverse enough to meet most customers and owners' needs in most regions, but we're always looking to enhance our ability to serve customers and owners globally. That, on occasion, includes creating new brands, and we are hard at work preparing to launch 2 new brands later this year. Our existing portfolio of industry-leading brands continues to outperform. The key stat we focus on: the measured brand strength, system-wide comp RevPAR index grew nearly 50 basis points year-over-year for the quarter.","Each year, thousands of consumer brands are rated by over 5,000 entrepreneurs and readers of Entrepreneur Magazine, resulting in a list of the top 120 most trusted brands. I'm pleased to share that 6 of our brands have been named on Entrepreneur's list. Hilton Worldwide has more brands appearing on this highly influential list than any other hotel company.","Now let me spend 1 minute and update you on the remainder of 2014. Looking forward, our group booking position for the remainder of the year is very strong, with meaningful increases in both volume and rate. Our 2014 group revenue position had our Big 8 hotels and the larger group of U.S. managed hotels is up in the high-single-digits compared to the same time last year. Corporate meetings, our highest-rated group segment, is outperforming previous full year revenue position by 12% in U.S. owned and managed.","As we look at the macroeconomic picture and outlook for lodging performance around the world, we see generally improving conditions and are very optimistic for the remainder of 2014. In the U.S., we continue to expect strong fundamentals with reasonable GDP growth driving demand that we expect to be paired with muted supply growth for some time to come. This should result in modestly better RevPAR growth than last year. The Asia-Pacific region should continue to lead RevPAR growth globally, with significant growth in Japan, driven by the ongoing effects of their easing monetary policy and strong and stable RevPAR growth in China in the 6% to 7% range, overcoming some regional weakness in Thailand.","In Europe, we continue to see improving performance and expect continued strong RevPAR growth led by the U.K. and Turkey, both areas where we have a large presence, compensating for relative sluggishness in France. Overall, we continue to expect Europe RevPAR growth to be up to the mid-single-digits for the full year of 2014.","In the Middle East and Africa region, continued weakness in Egypt and slower growth in the Arabia -- Arabian peninsula and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will weigh on results a bit, which is being mitigated by very solid growth in Africa.","As a result of these positive regional dynamics, we continue to be very optimistic for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we're raising the lower end of our full year comp RevPAR guidance 50 basis points, so they'll now be 5.5% to 7%. Our guidance for diluted earnings per share for the year is increasing to between $0.64 and $0.67, and our guidance for adjusted EBITDA is increasing to $2.415 billion to $2.465 billion. As a result, the new midpoint of our full year 2014 adjusted EBITDA guidance is above the top end of our previous guidance. We continue to expect net unit growth of 35,000 to 40,000 rooms to our managed and franchised segment, which would represent 5.5% to 6.5% unit growth in that segment.","In closing, we had a very strong quarter, beating our EPS and adjusted EBITDA guidance and outperforming on the top line, margins, bottom line and net unit growth. We continue to execute on value enhancement opportunities in our real estate portfolio and to aggressively deploy free cash flow to prepay debt and build equity value. We feel great about the fundamentals of the business and the set up for the remainder of the year.","I will now turn it over to Kevin Jacobs, our CFO, who will discuss the quarter's financial performance in a bit more detail. Kevin?","Kevin J. Jacobs","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our results for the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations. For the first quarter of 2014, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, totaled $0.13, ahead of our guidance of $0.08 to $0.10. Special items that have been adjusted in our first quarter results are related to share-based compensation expenses in connection with our IPO last December.","Total management and franchise fees were $331 million in the first quarter, an increase of 17% over the first quarter of 2013, driven by top line growth, new units and non-comp base fees. Franchise fees, in particular, exceeded our expectations, largely due to strong performance among our focused-service hotels in the United States. As new units enter the system and existing contracts roll over to our published franchise rates, our system-wide effective franchise rate continues to increase, now at 4.6% for the quarter.","In our ownership segment, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2014 of $179 million was 13% higher year-over-year, adjusted for a onetime gain on a lease we were bought out of in the first quarter of last year and a non-comp increase in affiliate fees. This performance was driven by segment adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 172 basis points adjusted on the same basis, as well as comparable year-over-year RevPAR growth of 5.1%.","Our timeshare segment first quarter EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA, excuse me, of $85 million was 44% better than the prior year, driven by transient rental, lower corporate support costs, favorable timing from the recognition of revenue and favorable adjustments in expected sale prices. Although a portion of this performance benefited from favorable timing, the segment results this quarter speak to the underlying strength of our timeshare business.","Corporate expense and other totaled $51 million in the first quarter compared to $68 million in the prior year. This decline was largely driven by a onetime credit of $18 million related to the conversion of our cash-based long-term incentive program into a stock-based program. This credit will reverse itself over the balance of the year and was built into our previous guidance. The expenses associated with our new share-based compensation program flow through our G&A expenses and are included in our adjusted EBITDA.","In terms of our regional performance, in the U.S., continued economic recovery drove comparable system-wide RevPAR growth of 6.5%, and comparable U.S. owned and operated hotels were up 6%. Great performance in rack rated business, with revenue in the quarter up 11%, and U.S. corporate transient business up 6.2% for the quarter and over 12% for the month of March year-over-year, contributed to strong growth in transient business. The Los Angeles and Florida markets had a strong quarter with RevPAR growth of 10% and over 8% respectively. San Francisco and Hawaii also remained strong markets for us, largely driven by strong transient demand. The New York market softened, with increased supply in weather impacting transient demand. Chicago and Washington, D.C. were also soft, driven by rate pressures and also weather.","Our hotels in the Americas outside of the U.S. has a very strong quarter with comparable year-over-year RevPAR up 12% for owned and operated hotels, driven by strength in Canada, Argentina, Mexico and Jamaica. In the Middle East and Africa, comparable currency neutral RevPAR declined less than 1% for the quarter, with continued political unrest in Egypt and weakness on the Arabian Peninsula offset by strong performance in our African hotels.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we continue to outperform, with strong demand in Japan and China driving comparable currency-neutral RevPAR growth of 8.7% for the quarter, primarily driven by rate. Japan, where we have a significant presence, continues to be extremely strong, growing RevPAR by over 25% in the quarter, while Greater China grew 7.5%.","Finally, in Europe, we had a very strong quarter, with comparable RevPAR growth up 6.5%, driven equally by occupancy and rate. We increased our market share premiums by 140 basis points and saw strength across all segments, with group revenue increases in Europe of 17% in the quarter, driven by company meetings and conventions. RAC [ph] revenue growth of 7% and corporate revenue growth of over 11% also contributed to the European strength. Regional strength in the U.K. and Turkey, as well as key markets in Continental Europe compensated for a weak France.","Turning to our balance sheet. We continued to reduce our leverage, working towards our objective to achieve investment-grade status by using substantially all of our fee cash flow to prepay debt and in turn, build equity value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we made voluntary prepayments totaling $200 million on our term loan. And in fact today, we are making another $100 million repayment on that loan. Also per the terms of our debt agreements, we further reduced our term loan interest rate by 25 basis points by achieving certain leverage thresholds.","Along with the 25 basis points reduction we achieved at the completion of our IPO, we have now reduced the rate on this loan by a total of 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 250 basis points. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents at $722 million, including $287 million of restricted cash. And we had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolving credit facility.","Finally, let's turn to our outlook for 2014. For the full year, as Chris mentioned, we are increasing our system-wide RevPAR guidance, expecting an increase of between 5.5% and 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with 60% to 70% of that growth expected to be driven by rate. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on the same basis. We are also increasing our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS, expecting a range of between $2.415 billion and $2.465 billion and EPS adjusted for special items of between $0.64 and $0.67 for the full year.","We continue to expect management and franchise fees to increase between 10% and 12% for the year. We are increasing our full year timeshare segment adjusted EBITDA guidance to $315 million to $330 million for the year and CapEx spending, excluding timeshare inventory, will total approximately $350 million, which includes about $250 million to $260 million in hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue.","We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation and still expect to prepay $700 million to $900 million in debt for the year, devoting substantially all of our free cash flow to building equity value. We expect corporate expense and other to increase between 3% and 5%, which includes incremental public company costs.","For the second quarter of 2014, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5.5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency neutral basis, as we benefit from strong seasonal occupancy and further room rate improvement. We expect second quarter diluted EPS adjusted for special items will total $0.18 to $0.20. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $635 million and $655 million. Further detail on our first quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks, and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Sharon, can we have our first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Those are really strong results for the first of the year. And I'm wondering, Chris, you talked about them continuing into the second half. What kind of data do you have that might give you confidence that the strength actually should last further into 2015?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes. Great question. And I think I said a couple times, we remain very optimistic because I think we do, and I do, and that is really based on, I mean, look at the overall business and the biggest segments, transient strength that we saw in the first quarter, that we continue to see in the second quarter. And based on everything we see, sort of going on economically in our biggest markets, we think will continue and that's matched with significant upticks and what -- in the group's phases. I mentioned in my prepared comments, for the first quarter in a long time, we saw system-wide group revenues growing faster than transient. Not that transient was bad. Transient were quite good. It's just group is picking up steam, which gives us confidence. If you look at our big hotels in the second half of the year, they're up nearly 20% in terms of position on the group side so it gives us a great deal of confidence. Along with the fact that we are starting to see, in part because of where we are in the cycle, in part because of some real hard work that our sales force is doing, we're starting to see the benefits of the ancillary spend focus and increases there. So it feels like the business is really hitting on all cylinders and sort of playing out the way we had thought it would. And we great about what's going to play out the rest of the year. Obviously, we hope we will and think we will continue to outperform.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, and then -- that's great. And the second question is on the call, you mentioned you've got 2 new brands coming. Can you talk about what segment of the market they'll address and do you need much CapEx to launch the brands?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes. On the first -- let me be clear, because I know a lot people asked that question. We do not think we need any real care [ph] . We don't intend to build in any of our new brands, any of this, on our balance sheet. We have a terrific group of owners, 10,000 owner relationships around the world, that are dying to do more with us because I think they believe in the strength of our brands and the market share of our brands and we're driving great profitability for them. And so in the 2 brands that I will briefly describe that we're working, we do not intend to do any of the building on our -- on our balance sheet and we do think we will be able to grow these at a very nice clip. The 2 brands are -- first, the one that will probably come first, I'd describe as a brand that will be a 4-plus-star brand that will aggregate iconic urban and resort hotels that don't really fit in the box of the specified standards of any of our other brands. What we find is increasingly, some of our existing customers, as well as other customers that we want to attain, are interested in those types of locations and staying in these kind of unique iconic hotels, and we think we can better serve our customers by offering that type of product. It often offers us a great way to serve them better, but also grow the company at a faster pace because not only will it not require CapEx, but it is very conversion-friendly as a brand. The second brand, which we've talked a lot about, is Lifestyle. And we -- I think, by the way, the first brand is probably is to launch sometime in the summer. The Lifestyle brand, we're way down the road on probably more in the fall. We are currently working on deals by the way, in both brands. And Lifestyle brand, which we'll talk a lot more about in the next call or 2, and give you a great amount of detail, our approach there is a little bit different than some of our competitors. Most of the competition has sort of accessed lifestyle at a luxury price point; we believe that there's a much broader base of demand at the upper end of upper upscale. And so we sort of are coining the phrase, \"accessible lifestyle\" from a price point of view. And we think that being at that price point and a product and service delivery that matches with that is going to allow us to serve more customers better and build a brand that is much bigger than what we've seen others be able to do. It also, by the nature of what it is, will incorporate newbuilds, none of ours, on our balance sheet, but will be very conversion-friendly. So I think these are going to be able to incrementally add significantly to the growth of the company long-term as well as short-term. Neither will have a particularly meaningful impact on this year's net unit growth, just given the sequence of when they're being launched, might have a little bit of impact, but not significant impact. But we'll start to have some good impacts starting next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First, I just wanted to touch on some of the New York impact that you guys are seeing, clearly not manifesting in the numbers here. But have the market-wide New York results given you guys any pause with respect to your guidance, as you look towards the back half of this year?","Christopher J. Nassetta","No. I mean, New York -- New York was impacted in the first quarter, and pretty soft, I'd say. It's really impacted by 3 things. One that a lot of people have talked about is supply. New York does have more supply than, frankly, any of the other major markets. But that was compounded, and I think what was more impactful was the year-over-year impact on the Superstorm Sandy business and then weather, of course, we're at the northeast corridor, but New York was particularly hard hit. So we think New York was softer we think in the first quarter than it will be for the remainder of the year. But it will probably, as a result of some of the supply issues, be a little bit softer overall than some of the other markets that are growing faster in the U.S. Long term, we think New York is going to be fantastic as it always is. The demand levels are growing and we think, over time, very easily absorb this new supply. And to get to the specific answer, we do not -- it doesn't -- I mean, we have factored that into all of our thinking in terms of our guidance. And we do not see a meaningful risk related to New York and the guidance we're giving you.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just one follow-up. If you, obviously, look at where you guided 1Q and what you ultimately delivered in the 1Q, and I know some of which was trucked up to timing and some corporate expense. But when you think about the back half of the year and the raise of overall guidance, it looks as though there could be a bit of conservatism in there. Is there anything that I could potentially be missing?","Christopher J. Nassetta","No, I think you got it right. We essentially flow through the beat for the first quarter in the increase in our guidance. We were -- we beat the midpoint by about $53 million. We increased guidance, the midpoint, by $40 million. Plus or minus $13 million of that was sort of timing within the year. So we flow through the full amount of the beat that wasn't timing, which we feel comfortable with. And that implies, as you've suggested, that we maintain the rest of the year. We feel comfortable that frankly, there probably is a bit of conservatism built into that. We would certainly hope we would do better.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first is a follow-up on your comment about the second brand that you may launch this summer, is that more of kind of a subtitle where you're just kind of putting hotels that are not currently in your system in there, rather than actually any sort of rebranding of those hotels or managing those hotels?","Christopher J. Nassetta","No, it is -- it is -- let's not say there -- that there may be opportunities to rebrand parts of our portfolio, but I think that is -- that would be very modest. Both the brands are focused on new units that are not in the system. So again, there may be very small amounts of things that can move around over time. But the deals that we are working on, and we are working on a meaningful number of deals in both new brands, are new units outside of our system. Some newbuilds, particularly with Lifestyle, but a significant number of conversions.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then for my second question just looking at the guidance raise, how EBITDA's raised more than the RevPAR's raised and fee growth is unchanged, but EBITDA up. Is that -- what's been primarily the driver there? Is it some kind of owned property margins, or what should we think as the biggest trends?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes, it's a little bit of flow-through. Basically, margin's better all around, a little bit of revenue, a little bit of margin, little bit of time share.","Kevin J. Jacobs","Right. And some in fees, Robin, obviously the fee...","Christopher J. Nassetta","There are some in fees...","Kevin J. Jacobs","The 10% to 12% is a wide range in fees, right? So we feel better about fees, but not quite better enough just yet to raise it to 11% to 13%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on timeshare, the sales were up 13%, very strong in the first quarter. Can you just give us a sense for how much of those are coming from your asset-light strategy, and how much more growth opportunities do you have there? And then the G&A costs even after adjusting for onetime benefits, they were lower than we were forecasting. And I think you've done a very good job on there. Can you just give us a sense for where that goes over the next couple of years? Does it -- does G&A flatten out? Or does it have to grow as you increase some of these brands, the number of brands?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Sure. On the first, I think it's simple. In the first quarter, we were a little less than 60% of our sales were in the asset-light. If you look at all of 2013, I think we're around 50%. So it ticked up in the first quarter. It will bounce around a little bit depending on what inventory's getting sold when. But if you just look at the trajectory, 80% of the existing inventory, which is roughly 5 years of inventory that we have is capital-light. So over time, that number should be growing. Naturally, as a result of most of our inventory -- the majority of our inventory being capital-light inventory. On the G&A side, thank you for your comment. Yes, we -- we're actually quite proud of the fact that we're very efficient in the G&A side of things. I think part of what even netting out for the comp stuff that you're seeing is there are some timing things going on in the first quarter that allowed it to be even better than what you might have been forecasting. Some of those things, obviously as the year plays out, will reverse themselves and occur in different quarters. Having said that, we, as I said, are very proud of the fact that we are very focused, very lean and mean in terms of our cost structure. We are not going to lose our cost discipline. As Kevin described, we said we'd have a 3% to 5% increase in G&A and other year-over-year. That's incorporating public company costs. Our objective would be to be in that same sort of range. Next year, they're even including the incremental step up in public company costs. So we do have, as you know being public, requires certain cost structures in the accounting and the legal and tax as well as having public company compensation, which in our case is flowing through and impacting is being taken out of our EBITDA. So when you factor for those things, we will have some increases, but we believe are very modest increases.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","It really was a good quarter, so it might be a little bit nitpicking here. But as I look at owned hotel RevPAR growth of 5.7% and I look at owned hotel revenue growth of 3%-ish. You got some FX drag, and from what we gather, maybe the joint venture hotels delivered very good results, which did not flow through to revenue in that line item. But my question is what, do the Big 8 hotels do in the quarter? You mentioned the food and beverage and outside-the-room spend. But what was the RevPAR growth of the Big 8?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Big 8 RevPAR growth was 5.1%, I think, and revenue growth was, I think, a little bit better than that.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Is 5.1%, are you surprised at all with that, given the shift in the holidays and the way the group is ramping up...","Christopher J. Nassetta","No, we expected pretty -- I mean in fact, that outperformed what our expectation was. And the Big 8, because it's just 8 hotels. It ends up being largely a function of sort of when the groups are cycling through year-over-year and the comps of when we have big groups in the year before. So that was actually better than our expectations. The Big 8 are performing really well. They're going to have a great year. As I said, the Big 8, the group position for the second half of the year is up almost 20 -- it's 19-and-change, almost 20% up. So the second half of the year is going to be, from a RevPAR growth point of view, much stronger for the Big 8 than the first half of the year. Second quarter would be better but the second half, much, much better. And again that's just the function of individual hotels and the group business they had last year and groups they have on the books this year.","Kevin J. Jacobs","And Bill, I think for the overall segment, it was 5.1% for the quarter. So the difference between the RevPAR and the revenue wasn't as extreme. And as you said, there were some FX in there and some non-comp stuff, particularly outside the U.S.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. The 5.1% was post-FX, I think, right? But -- yes.","Kevin J. Jacobs","Yes.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And I think you nailed it. The follow-up question was do you have any commentary, Chris, on the group trends as we look into '15? I know it's early, but I'd love to get whatever color you might have on that.","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes, it's early, but the site lines we have feel pretty good. I mean the second half of the year is very good momentum, and I think very indicative of what's going on if I talk to our guys, which I do all the time. On the sales side, they feel very good about the momentum that's building in terms of pace and position into next year, and frankly, into '16. So I think good things are on the way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Chris, on the timeshare side of your business, I'm just wondering if you think the market is valuing your timeshare business appropriately? I mean, Marriott has obviously spun off. And now we have the Hyatt announcement this week. Just wondering, would you be consider -- would you consider spinning off the units and perhaps get some more value?","Christopher J. Nassetta","You'd have to tell me or investors would have to tell me how they're valuing it. I don't -- I don't know the answer in terms of whether it's individually, people are valuing us very weak. We are very committed to the business. Marriott spun theirs, as you point out. Hyatt sold theirs this week. We really like the timeshare business for, I think, some really obvious reasons. Number one, it is a great business. It's our -- the customers in our timeshare business are our most loyal customers. In the hotel side of our business, the day after they buy a timeshare unit, they spend 40% more with us in the hotel business. We like taking the ability to take care of those customers that have become so loyal. We have a very focused strategy, as you know, which has driven great results even through the downturn in terms of growing revenue, growing margin, growing EBITDA. And on top of all of that, as we talked about answering Steve's question, we've been converting the model to be much like the hotel model, where now 80% of our inventory is for third parties, where the returns in the business are going up astronomically, as we depend not on our own balance sheet but on others' balance sheets. So the combination of these customers being so valuable, very good margins, very good growth and not demanding the kind of capital that it has with other companies or what we had been using historically, we are committed to the business. We think it's a great business. And ultimately, we think, as we continue to tell the story and we transform the business to being more and more capital-light, we certainly believe it -- and are hopeful and believe that the markets will reflect it in our value.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Very helpful. And just for my follow-up regarding asset monetization. You talked about the retail build-out at the Hilton in New York. Just wondering if you have thoughts in terms of partnering on that project, or if there will be any partners? And then any thoughts you might have or updates on plans for the Waldorf?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes. On the New York Hilton, it's a pretty straightforward project. So we certainly will be working with others as it relates to how we end up merchandising it and how we end up finding the right tenants to maximize the opportunity. But in terms of actually doing the construction and the like, it's pretty straightforward. And we think I mean, that our team can do it working in conjunction with some consultants. So we do not intend to have a partner with that. On the Waldorf, obviously, a great deal of interest in it. We understand why. And trust me, we spend a significant amount of time focused on the Waldorf, as I mentioned on the last call. We are deep into the weeds in figuring out the best way to maximize the value of the Waldorf. We think there is a huge amount of value there that is untapped. We are way down the path in figuring that out and figuring out the way to execute against it. We are not yet in a position -- and I'm not being coy, just being honest. We're not in a position to really articulate what that is because we're that's just not far enough down that path. I said on the last call, we -- it would be our objective to be able to lay that out in a great amount of detail by the end of the year, and I think we're on good path to be able to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Kevin, I think in one of the previous answers you gave you mentioned, you weren't yet prepared to kind of bump up the fee guidance range. But as we looked at it, 17% or so growth year-on-year on the management franchise fees is one of the various surprises to us in the quarter. So I was wondering, could you give us just like a little bit more of a sense of where you are in terms of raising the royalty rates, and how that kind of laps versus last year? Because I think that was one of the big growth drivers that we saw in this quarter.","Kevin J. Jacobs","Yes, it wasn't as much. But raising the royalty rates, we're on track. Every new deal we roll over, the new deals we rolled over in the first quarter were at a full point higher than they were before. The reason you're seeing -- the big reason you're seeing a difference between the 17% we showed in the -- we achieved in the first quarter and the full year is we had some non-comp affiliate fees that were higher in the first quarter that didn't exist, or that were lower in the first quarter of last year, and then we had some timing of some change of ownership fees that were expected in the second quarter, and the deals happened more quickly and they ended up in the first quarter. So the difference is just a little bit of non-comp fees and a little bit of timing, which gets you between -- bridges you between the 2.","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes, but I think Kevin's right. We would hope to be at the higher end of that guidance. But that's certainly from standpoint of how we're driving the business, and what we see in the first quarter...","Kevin J. Jacobs","And how we feel about RevPAR.","Christopher J. Nassetta","And how we feel about where our RevPARs are going, we would like to be better -- at the better end of that.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure, that makes sense. And then I guess second question, just big picture, Chris, maybe give us your -- just your thoughts about not specific kind of value opportunities, more just broadly about asset sales and the right time in the cycle to sell. Because we do see a lot more private equity hotel activity starting to pick up, and it does seem like a number of your assets might be attractive to that type of buyer, as we move through the cycle here.","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes, that's a really good question and a topic we address a lot, both on calls and in meetings. I think we've been pretty consistent, so we'll try and remain consistent, which is we think in terms of the assets that we own, there is tremendous potential in those assets. We are, in our view, as described by sort of being mid-cycle and what's going on in the group and the east [ph] hotels are largely driven by that. We think there's tremendous operating upside in the bulk of these assets. We also, as we, I think, proven with Hawaii, and now New York Hilton, and we talked about what's coming in the Waldorf. And there are other things that we're working on. We think there's tremendous value to enhance the property. So we're very focused on that. To the extent, when we think about whether we should be more asset-light, whether we should hold these, again, we think there's, from a growth point of view, there are a lot of reasons have these assets and benefit from the growth. I said, I think, many, many times, having said that and all those opportunities, we're not in love with having to own real estate. We're in love and committed to creating shareholder value. But we're creating shareholder value as it relates to our assets, purely the big ones that really drive the value is about sort of the after-tax benefits to all of our shareholders. When we talk about the real estate and doing individual asset sales, at least on much of the major real estate, it doesn't make as much sense as potential is looking over time at the real estate as part of more of a structured transaction or a series of structured transactions. And then, it's a little bit different equation, obviously, than what the market is and PE [ph] firm's buying. It really becomes more an equation on where our relative valuations and multiples of OpCos and PropCos. And when we look at that today, we -- and we're happy to get any feedback, anybody who wants to give it. We look at that today, we don't see a meaningful arbitrage that says that OpCo -- that incents you on behalf of the whole shareholder base to want to do something because we don't think that there's a value play. If we thought there was one when and if there is, we won't be shy about it. But the idea of doing large-scale individual asset sales -- I'm not going to say we would do none. We are always exploring and there may be, on a very limited basis, an opportunity for some of that. But any kind of large scale meant the real estate really wants to be done in efficient sort of structured content context.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. Just your development pipeline continues to grow, nice sequential growth since you reported last in February. Are you getting more requests from developers on Capital Front Hilton to contribute to new deals? Or has it been relatively steady?","Christopher J. Nassetta","I'd say it's been relatively steady. I was, in fact, looking at the numbers a couple weeks ago with our development teams, because we were all together. We -- if you look at the deals we're doing by number that are in the pipeline, it's less than 5% of the overall deals that have any contribution from us. And when you look at it statistically, which is the best way to answer this, that has been pretty consistent over the last 3 or 4 years. So statistically, no. In terms of anecdotally when we around the table approving every deal we do, which we do, around this very table we're sitting at, no, it feels about the same. It's very rare that we are contributing. Obviously, 95-plus percent of the time, we are contributing no capital. And it feels about the same as it has.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My questions have been asked.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","There's a lot of concern heading into the quarter around your New York exposure. Can you just give us what your outsized geographic EBITDA exposure is by city? So like New York, Hawaii, I know you have big exposure, and a lot of people are focused on D.C. Any other markets you can call out?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes, I mean, I can do it in -- at a high level summary. In New York, our existing supply is about consistent with what we have across the U.S., so we're not really over-indexed. We have 10.5%, 11% of the U.S. market and we're about 10% -- 10% to 11% of New York. In terms of EBITDA, it's roughly about, with the owned assets there really driving at about 8% of EBITDA. Hawaii is almost an identical, coincidentally identical story. We are, in Hawaii, about sort of at the market for what we have across the U.S., 10% to 11% in U.S. share, 10% to 11% of the Hawaiian market. And it also is about given we have 2 large assets, about 8% of the EBITDA. Affiliate D.C., we over-indexed in terms of what our level of supply is, so we are about 15%. If you look at D.C., and I'm giving D.C. sort of everything, Maryland, Virginia and D.C., sort of the broader radius around D.C. But it only is about 2.7% plus -- less than 3% of EBITDA. And that is obviously in part driven by we don't have any major real estate. It is predominately in D.C. fee -- management franchise fee business.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just, if I heard this correctly, it sounds like you're getting, or you're expecting to get about $600 a square foot for your New York Hilton retail that you're repositioning. Are there other opportunities just on the -- is that right or no?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes, that's in the net, directionally.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I mean, that's a very high number. Are there other properties? Do you think you can do that high rent? Or I mean can you just talk about the retail opportunity in general?","Christopher J. Nassetta","There are -- that's pretty unique. There's probably one other that is reasonably unique in that same city that we talked about earlier, not being coy. The Waldorf, while we have retail at the Waldorf, I would say to you, clearly one of the opportunities and I don't want to go -- obviously, we're not ready to display the whole thing. But clearly, I can say one of the opportunities in the Waldorf is not only to do the retail more intelligently but more of it. If you just take a gander and walk the full city block that we own on Park Avenue, and sort of take it in and think about retail. And I think you would very quickly conclude there are big retail opportunities there. So we -- as part of the overall Waldorf plan, are very, very focused on enhancing the whole retail platform.","Operator","We will take one more question. And it is from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question, actually this is for you, Kevin, I might have missed it, but what's the implicit adjusted EBITDA margin growth for full year 2014 guidance? Is it about 250 basis points for the company?","Kevin J. Jacobs","It is about -- sorry, I don't have it.","Christopher J. Nassetta","150 to 200.","Kevin J. Jacobs","150 to 200, yes, sorry.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, maybe, Chris, just back on timeshare. Stepping back, can you talk about what the consumer appetite is for timeshare today [ph] compared to maybe the prior peak? because some, I guess I'll call them discretionary products are just a shadow of their former selves and others have been fairly robust. I'd be interested in hearing how you think it's doing versus at prior peak level and maybe what's changed in the industry since the 2000s in terms of who's buying or where that demand is coming from?","Christopher J. Nassetta","It -- I think the story is very simple. And they may -- consumers may not want a lot of other products, but they want timeshare more than they did at the prior peak. So if you just look at our -- the best indication of that is where our sales are versus prior peak, and where it is versus our competition for that matter. But we see increasing velocity of demand in timeshare. The product really resonates with the customer. And thus, the strength of the results that you see. So it's certainly not seen any sort of waning appetite. To the contrary, increasing appetite for the product.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call over to the presenters.","Christopher J. Nassetta","Well, thanks, everybody. We appreciate the time today. We're obviously quite pleased with the first quarter, and as we've said many times, both focused on the rest of the year and in the coming years, as well as very optimistic about what the rest of this year and the next few years are going to be like. So we look forward to catching up with everybody after our second quarter. Thanks, and have a great weekend.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report first quarter performance in line with our expectations, driven by growth across all three of our businesses. We've also made great progress on the initiatives that we discussed last quarter, including the spins of our real estate and timeshare businesses as well as our initiatives to strengthen our direct relationship with customers, both of which I'll update you on in just a few minutes.","As we discussed on our last call, we believe fundamentals will support solid top line growth this year. The best visibility we have on the demand side continues to be in the group business segment, which remains healthy. We have less visibility in the transient demand which makes up the largest portion of our business and historically tracks more closely with macro indicators such as GDP growth.","Within transient, we continue to see relative strength in leisure, with softer corporate business driven by weaker macro conditions. We did see strong U.S. booking pace across all segments and channels in-the-month, for-the-month of April, particularly in corporate transient.","Looking forward, consensus forecasts are for full-year U.S. GDP growth to be modestly lower than last year at plus or minus 2%, with Q2 through Q4 meaningfully stronger than Q1. As a result, we are maintaining our 2016 RevPAR growth expectations of 3% to 5% which assumes U.S. GDP growth of roughly 1.5% to 2.5% for the year, and we're also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance.","While we expect to continue capitalizing on these positive fundamentals, we also remain very focused on driving value beyond what the broader economy gives us. Our distinct high-quality brands with global presence create a powerful network effect, driving greater value for our customers and hotel owners alike. As a result, Hilton has led the industry in both market share premiums and organic net unit growth as a percentage of installed base for the past several years, a trend we expect to continue.","We signed a record 100,000 rooms in 2015 and are on track to top that in 2016 with 26,000 rooms approved for development in the first quarter. With nearly 1.1 million rooms open or under development, including nearly 300,000 rooms in the pipeline, we maintained our No. 1 position in global supply, active pipeline and rooms under construction according to Star.","More importantly, our net unit growth continues to accelerate off a larger base of rooms, with 45,000 to 50,000 net rooms expected to join our system in 2016, a 10% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. Nearly 25% of the more than 1,700 hotels in our pipeline will fly flags of brands that did not exist seven years ago. At no material cost to us, we have organically developed carefully targeted new brands that further strengthen our network effect by bringing new customers into our system and offering more opportunities for existing customers to stay with us.","We launched our latest brand, Tru by Hilton, in the mid-scale space just three months ago with 130 deals committed or in process, and since that time we have averaged one Tru deal per day. As of today, we have 48 hotels in the pipeline and 170 more deals committed or in progress, and that's driven almost entirely by existing Hampton owners. We believe Tru is already the fastest growing new development brand launched in U.S. lodging history and we expect to open development more broadly in the near term including to owners not currently in the Hilton system.","The ebbs and flows of capital markets continue to naturally constrain supply growth disproportionately favoring global branded systems like ours that can drive leading returns for hotel owners. New brands like Tru, Home2, Canopy and Curio help supercharge our growth but we continue to have tremendous opportunities ahead following demand and capital patterns around the world with all of our brands.","Outside the U.S. in particular which represents more than half of our pipeline, we believe we are in the infancy of our potential growth. Deploying our brands into new geographies like Hampton into China or DoubleTree into Europe made up nearly one-third of our gross openings over the last 12 months. We have global scale in a business where scale matters and are using it to drive a more direct relationship with all of our customers.","In February, we launched 'Stop Clicking Around', our largest global marketing campaign ever, highlighting the key customer benefits of our network effect and its scale, namely that joining Hilton HHonors and booking directly with Hilton offers customers the best value and a better experience. Early results are very positive with HHonors enrolments increasing nearly 90% since launch, helping drive HHonors occupancy to a record 55% in the quarter, an increase of more than 4 points versus last year.","The business we've received through Web Direct is higher than it's ever been and is growing faster than ever, thanks to increasing share shift. The share of Web Direct channels in our distribution mix is growing 5x that of the OTA share growth in the quarter, and business generated from our mobile app is up nearly 150% year-over-year with downloads exceeding 70,000 a week, an increase of 200% over last year.","One of the most important metrics of our success is RevPAR index premiums. We continued to gain share in the quarter with our system increasing its RevPAR index premium 90 basis points with every brand in every region gaining market share.","Lastly, a quick update on the spins we announced last quarter. As discussed, simplifying Hilton as a capital-light fee-based business while fully activating our real estate and timeshare businesses as stand-alone companies should realize significant benefits for all three companies and our shareholders. We're very pleased with the progress on the spins to date and remain on track to file Form 10 registration statements with the SEC this quarter and to execute the spins by year end.","Also this morning, we were very pleased to announce the leadership team for our real estate company with Tom Baltimore as CEO and Sean Dell'Orto as CFO. I'm thrilled that Tom, a respected leader in our sector with experiences spanning REIT, private equity and operating companies, including senior roles at both Hilton and Marriott, will be leading the REIT. I've known Tom for 30 years and believe his proven leadership and track record as a capital allocator should further the company's potential to create meaningful value for shareholders over the long term.","We're also giving up one of our best and brightest with Sean moving over to REIT as Chief Financial Officer. As many of you know, Sean currently serves as Hilton's Treasurer and has been integral in our corporate strategy, capital markets and investor relations activities since joining us in 2010 including our IPO. Sean joined us from Crestline Hotels & Resorts where he was CFO. We look forward to partnering with Tom and Sean in their new roles.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give you a little bit more detail on the quarter. Kevin?","Kevin J. Jacobs","Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. First quarter RevPAR growth of 2.1% was at the low end of our guidance range, largely reflecting lower macroeconomic growth in the quarter and a larger than expected impact from the Easter calendar shift. Weakness in corporate transient demand was a 60 basis point drag on total occupancy for the quarter, but we still expect modest occupancy growth for the full year.","Transient RevPAR grew 2.4% in the quarter. Results were supported by solid leisure revenue trends that were up in the mid-single-digits, but offset by weaker corporate transient and oil and gas markets which were down nearly 5%. As Chris mentioned, we have seen stabilization in corporate transient so far in April with solid in-the-month for-the-month increases in pace.","Group business in the quarter continued to perform in line with expectations, with group room revenue increasing nearly 4% in our Americas owned and managed portfolio and over 15% at our big six assets in what is a seasonally slow group quarter. Results were led by robust performance at our Hawaiian and San Francisco properties and boosted by strong bookings in the smurf and company meeting segments.","Even more importantly, group position for Americas owned and managed hotels continues to track up in the mid-single-digits and pace in-the-year for-the-year was up in the high single digits during the first quarter, driven by both volume and rate.","Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased to $653 million, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range, driven by solid results across all three of our businesses and including roughly $10 million of favorable timing items in timeshare. System-wide adjusted EBITDA margins increased a solid 260 basis points versus the prior period to 38.9%.","Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items increased 42% for the quarter to $0.17, at the high end of our guidance range.","Turning to our segments, Management and Franchise beat expectations totaling $409 million in the quarter, an increase of nearly 5% year-over-year. Our fee segment growth rate was affected by some large franchise sales transactions during Q1 of last year.","In the Ownership segment, RevPAR grew 3.1% in the quarter as growth was tempered by softer demand in Chicago and New York and supported by strong RevPAR growth in San Francisco, Orlando and Hawaii, which all benefited from strong group trends. Adjusted EBITDA for the Ownership segment was $207 million, up 13% versus Q1 2015 when adjusted for the sale of the Hilton Sydney.","Timeshare revenues totaled $326 million in the quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year as we lapped strong sales from the Grand Islander project in Waikiki last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $95 million in the quarter, an increase of 28%, which was driven by favorable sales mix and resort operations results. We continue to make progress on our ongoing shift to a capital efficient business with third-party intervals increasing to 64% of intervals sold for the quarter and accounting for 85% of our inventory or 110,000 units.","Now turning to our regional performance and outlook, in the U.S., comparable RevPAR grew 1.8% in the quarter. Hawaii and Northern California markets were strong with RevPAR growth in the high single digits, driven by rate gains across all segments. Reduced city-wides continued to affect Chicago while oil markets struggled with weaker demand and increasing supply in New York continued to weigh on pricing power.","International inbound revenues declined in the quarter continuing late 2015 trends as weak demand from Canada and Brazil failed to offset increases from China, the U.K. and Japan. We expect this softness to continue but have less of an impact as comps get easier in the back half of the year. For full year 2016, we continue to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in the low to mid single digits.","In the Americas outside of the U.S., RevPAR rose 4.4% in the quarter. Although Brazil remained an overhang on the region given a deepening recession and weakening currency, the Olympics this summer should provide a much-needed boost in demand. Our Latin American properties continued to perform well given a broader strengthening in leisure trends. For full-year 2016, we continue to expect RevPAR growth in the region to be mid-single-digits.","RevPAR in Europe increased 2.9% in the first quarter, supported by strong market share gains of 230 basis points. Continental Europe performed well with strong transient group demand particularly across Germany and Prague. The U.K., namely London, remained soft and security concerns continued to pressure our results in Turkey. The tragic events in Brussels had a local effect on business but have not meaningfully affected regional performance. For full-year 2016, we continue to expect low to mid single-digit RevPAR growth for the European region.","The Middle East and Africa region struggled with RevPAR down 4.7% in the quarter, given continued weakness in Egypt and depressed leisure demand in the UAE. With uncertainty in the region expected to continue weighing on results, our full-year 2016 RevPAR forecast assumes growth is flat to slightly down in the region.","In the Asia-Pacific region, RevPAR increased 7.1% in the quarter with continued strength in Japan and China, our largest regional markets. Business in Japan has been particularly strong, especially in Tokyo, and we have not seen a meaningful impact from the recent earthquakes. RevPAR growth in Greater China reaccelerated to 8% in the quarter as an uptick in group business across key cities drove occupancy gains. We also saw strength in Taiwan, Singapore, India and Malaysia. We expect RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region to increase in the mid to high single digits for the year with RevPAR in China up 5% to 6%.","Moving on to capital allocation, during the first quarter we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share. Our Board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share for the second quarter of 2016 as well. We remain committed to achieving a low investment grade credit profile and still expect to initiate a stock buyback program subsequent to the execution of our spin transactions, which we expect to complete later this year.","As Chris mentioned, we are maintaining our full-year 2016 RevPAR growth guidance of 3% to 5% and also are maintaining our full-year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance ranges. Please note that our full-year guidance does not incorporate the impact of our intended real estate and timeshare spins.","For the second quarter of 2016, we expect 3% to 5% system-wide RevPAR growth supported by stabilizing macro trends and the Easter shift. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $790 million and $810 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.25 to $0.27.","Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. As a reminder, we unfortunately cannot provide many additional details on the proposed spins until we file Form 10 registration statements, which we still expect to occur later this quarter. In addition to the filings, we also expect to provide additional information on the strategy and financial performance of all three companies prior to the execution of the spins.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","William A. Crow","Congratulations on the hires on the REIT side, that's great. Chris, my question is on guidance and the range that you provided, we appreciate you provided any guidance, but 3% to 5%, given the first quarter and the outlook for the second quarter, to hit the high end would imply something north of 6% for the back half of the year, and I'm just curious whether that's even possible at this point given some of the dynamics around the industry?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Bill, thanks for the question. I assumed we would get that first and probably second, third, fourth and fifth as well because I know that's what's on everybody's mind, is trying to get a little color. So let me try and give you that color and maybe answer some other questions that are likely to come up.","I think that what we tried to triangulate around what we are seeing both in the business now and what we see on a forward-looking basis where we do have sight lines and try to match it up with a perspective on and an expectation on broader economic growth, and that's why we connected the 3% to 5% to 1.5% to 2.5% broader GDP growth because obviously the largest part of our business which is the corporate transient business is fairly directly related to broader economic growth.","And so while first quarter obviously in the low 2s is below the range in 3% to 5% that we're giving, the confidence we have in the 3% to 5% is based really on three different things, okay. One is a little bit of the reverse of the Easter effect. I'm not going to say that that's tremendously dramatic but that's a benefit.","The second is that as I said in our \u2013 and Kevin said in the prepared comments, we have a very good group position on the books for the rest of the year. For the full year the numbers are quite healthy, but that is distributed, as is always the case, every quarter is a little bit different every year depending on how that group cycled through a lot of the big hotels, in this particular year the way it's distributed is, across the system Q1 is actually quite weak, was quite weak from a group position point of view and Q2, Q3 and Q4 are much stronger with particularly a little bit heavier strength in Q2 and Q3, reasonably good numbers in Q4, a little less than Q2 and Q3. So we have a much stronger group base coming into Q2 through Q4 which we think will help.","The other thing is, and this gets back to the broader economic growth issue, if you think about what's been going on with corporate transient which is what's been really weak because leisure has been strong and driving the results in the fourth quarter and frankly in the first quarter that were a bit lower than what we would have hoped or expected, it had to do with the fact that the world froze up. I mean you had things going on with fears of what was going to happen with China's economy, terrorism in Paris, terrorism in Brussels and other things going on that drove the capital markets, the equity capital markets downward. Companies were losing 20%, 30% of their equity market cap. Well, you know that scares people.","There was a lot of fear in the air at the end of last year and certainly the first couple of months of this year, and the result of that, and we saw it very dramatically, was people freezed. They stopped making decisions on discretionary spending, on travel, on CapEx spend, and the result is the economic growth numbers come down. I think when you see the print on Q1, it's going to be quite low and that rippled through to our business.","So what's different? In addition to the group and the reversal of the Easter effect, why do I feel like 3% to 5% is reasonable for the full-year and for Q2? It's because I sort of told you, as I say it to our guys, the great thaw is on, meaning the world is not \u2013 make no mistake, I'm not trying to be a Pollyanna \u2013 the world is not, there are things going on in the world that aren't great, but relative to what we saw at the end of last year and the first couple of months of this year, there's a heck of a lot more stability.","The equity markets obviously have come back. Valuations not just in our industry but broadly have come back. And I'd say there is an air about stability and that ultimately I think translates into more economic growth. Certainly to get to a 2% sort of consensus for GDP off of what I think will be very low numbers in the first quarter, it anticipates Q2 through Q4 being a lot better. That is what we believe will happen all things being equal, meaning that the stability that exists today are relative to stability continues.","Do we have any sight lines into that? Some, I mean I talked about group which continues not only to be good in terms of position but pace is good. So we see the first quarter pace of group bookings for the rest of the year have been very healthy of late. April feels pretty darn good, okay, and certainly relative to what we experienced in the first quarter. And why is it better in April? Because corporate business is coming back.","Now that's not a huge dataset admittedly. You're looking at not even a full month of data. But there is the beginning in my mind of a trend. So that's a long-winded way of saying that if you think that you're going to get through a broader growth number that is around consensus, it by definition means that you're going to see some better things happening in the business.","Now obviously 3% to 5% growth is not \u2013 we're not suggesting we're going back to 2014 type transient growth numbers or the first half of last year. It's obviously the growth is somewhat more tempered than that, but we do believe, again all things being equal for these three primary reasons, that you're going to see performance in Q2 through Q4 that is superior to Q1 performance.","Kevin J. Jacobs","As it relates to the high-end, you know that's why we gave you a range. So you would have to believe \u2013 I agree, you would have to believe that broader economic growth is meaningfully above consensus to get that, but that's why we gave a range. We assumed that we are forecasting somewhere in the midpoint of our range and we've given you a range of outcomes if the economy and broader growth is lower or higher.","William A. Crow","Appreciate the insights. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steven Kent","Two questions. First is the $9 million in costs that were incurred from the spin-offs in the first quarter 2016, how much should we start to put into our models for the remainder of the year, just general numbers? I know they are extraordinary but I just want to have some sense for what that's going to look like. And then separately, I mean you continue to show very strong margin growth. I just want to understand the balance of the shift towards asset-light, more franchising, more management versus the opportunity to reduce expense structure at the owned hotels and what initiatives do you have on both sides of those to improve the margins?","Christopher J. Nassetta","On the first, unfortunately I'm not going to satisfy your need there. We're going to have a lot of information that we're going to \u2013 we're just around the bend from filing the Form 10 that will give you a much better sense of what we think and supplemental information ultimately that will give you a much better sense of the cost. So if you could just wait a teeny amount of additional time, I think we'll give you some clarity on that. We'd rather do it in a more complete way as we give disclosures on both companies.","On the margin side, obviously yes, we're growing margins in all three businesses. Going forward, all three of those businesses, as we get to the spins, are going to be doing that as independent companies. One of the things I'd talk about here is, and I understand why the market seems to be exceptionally focused on top line, everything is about top line, we don't get a lot of questions on margins and bottom line, so I appreciate it because we're running a very big global complex business and it starts at the top line but driving cost and margins to get it to the bottom line which I think frankly we've done quite an effective job not just in this quarter but for years and years while we've been public and while we've been private, I honestly don't think gets sort of enough attention or discussion.","Probably on the limits of time on this call, it would be hard to go into all of those initiatives. I mean part of the margin growth is obviously coming from the really industry-leading growth that we're getting on the new unit side and continuing to see all of the new units coming-in in the Management and Franchise segment where essentially those are 100% margin business additions, but on the Timeshare side, as you'll see as we break that business apart, you'll see in the Form 10, we have done a tremendous amount of work there to drive what I believe are industry-leading margins by just being much more efficient on how we sell and distribute the product.","And then inside the hotels, we have hundreds of initiatives that are going on all the time on the labor side, labor management side, making sure we're driving efficiency in every way possible on procurement, et cetera. So there is a constantly evolving but long list of things that we're doing in the hotels. I think it's fair to say we are exceptionally focused not just on driving top line but cost, and ultimately we are running the whole business and trying to drive margins as high as we can to get as much EBITDA to the bottom line as possible.","Operator","The next question will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis","I've been getting a reasonable number of questions on the topic of the Marriott-Starwood merger and its potential impact on Hilton and whether or not it puts you at a competitive disadvantage. So I wonder if you could take a minute and give us your thoughts on what circumstances that might be right and then where it misses the mark?","Christopher J. Nassetta","I'm happy to answer it in some ways. I don't want to get snarky about what our competitors are doing. I think the way to think about it is that we have chosen a path proactively which is a different path than others, including them have taken, and that started with the fact that we did not get involved in the process of when Starwood last summer put themselves in play, and that was related to the fact that as we looked at it and we looked at what our opportunity was, we were very focused on having purebred brands that were market segment leaders in their individual segments, that were category killers and that each of our individual existing brands we wanted to be described that way, and any individual brand that we might add to the system, and we obviously have had a number, we wanted to fall in that category.","And as a result to drive the highest market share by brand, the highest average market share, which ultimately we thought and think will drive, as a result of resonating with customers, will drive the highest organic growth, and we chose not to want to have the distractions that would come with doing something like that. And I think if you look at our numbers and what we're driving in terms of organic growth, as I said in my prepared comments, we've been leading the industry for the last several years, I think we'll continue to lead the industry, and I think what we're focused on is making sure that every brand we have really resonates with customers and with owners and that we continue to drive that growth and I think that sort of the story.","In terms of scale, I said in my comments, we are in a business where scale matters and we think we have enough scale. I think my attitude, our attitude at this point when you have existing system and pipeline that's 1.1 million rooms, we're big enough and we're in the game of quality at this size as opposed to quantity.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Vince Ciepiel","I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on supply growth. It seems like your pipeline continues to act nicely. Could you comment on what products specifically you think are adding to that? And then also, could you maybe speak to as you think about supply growth over the next couple of years, any natural suppressors that you're starting to see come into place that could put a ceiling on supply growth?","Christopher J. Nassetta","First, thanks for the question, and an important one as well. I think there already is a natural ceiling on supply growth. I mean it is creeping up a little bit but it's still well below long-term averages and I suspect will be lower than people think as it has been the last couple of years when the year is out. It's going to be somewhere in my mind between 1.5% and 1.75% against the 2.5% long-term average.","So I think very much in check, and I think the reason that it's in check is really simple and that is, while there is capital available, it's limited amounts of capital, and the basic economics only support a certain amount of development and largely what you would find is that is in the limited service space. We happen to have in my mind the best limited service brands out there. So from the standpoint of what we're seeing product-wise, it's all as described or a little bit as described in my prepared comments.","Now Tru with our new brand, Home2, Homewood, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton, that's the large majority certainly in the U.S. of what we see getting done largely in secondary and tertiary markets. Why is that getting done? Two reasons. That's where the economics make sense where demand growth is heavy enough, where pricing structures and cost to build makes sense so owners can get the economics.","And why are we getting disproportionately 2.5x our existing system size in the U.S.? There is a simple reason. Our brands are strong enough, market share is strong enough that while there is limited financing, we are getting a disproportionate amount of that financing.","So I've said it before, we're sort of in a sweet spot for us which is there are some pretty decent natural constraints on supply, but yet we're getting a disproportionate share of what's available to get done because we're one of the most financeable and we're driving the best economics for owners so they want to continue to invest with us.","Vince Ciepiel","Great, thanks. And then maybe another big picture question. I think that you mentioned that you guys expect occupancy to swing positive for the year. If you look in the quarter, you have occupancy slightly down and somewhat more modest rate growth. When you think back over historical cycles and kind of where we are within a hotel that's relatively full, do you need occupancy to swing positive for rate to accelerate from the first quarter level or is it something else that could cause rate to accelerate, maybe confidence or something like that?","Christopher J. Nassetta","No, I don't think you need occupancy. I think you're going to see the vast majority of RevPAR growth in the industry and certainly for us be rate at this point and then that's what you would expect at this point. We've been saying that this would come for the last couple of years. I think the reason we think \u2013 first of all, first quarter if you just neutralize for the Easter effect, would've been positive, a slightly positive occupancy growth. So I think it's just a reversal of that, a much stronger group base and some basic pick-up off a very weak corporate transient demand as I described in my first answer that's going to drive some modest occupancy growth. I don't think it's going to be big time occupancy growth. I think it's just sort of reversal of some of those three trends that drive more volume in the last three quarters of the year.","Operator","The next question will come from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rich Hightower","One quick question on the Hilton flagship brand that I noticed just scanning the room count, it does look like the brand lost a handful of managed hotels in every region except for Asia-Pac but then there looks to be basically a one-for-one offset in the franchised segment. Can we assume those are basically the same hotels just converting to franchise agreements, and then is that a trend that we should expect to continue?","Christopher J. Nassetta","I don't think it's a major trend. I think it was one portfolio that we have in the U.K. in some of our leased estates that as we were restructuring some of that relationship, we flipped from managed to franchise. So I don't see it as a big trend. I think it was fairly unique to that transaction.","Rich Hightower","Okay, that's helpful, Chris. And then one quick follow-up, just on the outlook for energy markets, it does seem like the outlook for Houston and some other places might be incrementally better over the next 12 to 18 months given what may appear to be a bottoming in oil prices. Are you actually seeing any fundamental acceleration in demand in those markets or is it just a function of easy comps going forward?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Not yet, not yet. I think you got two opportunities there. One, the comps get much, much easier really in third and fourth quarter. If you look at the dive in those markets last year, first quarter not so much, second quarter it started, third and fourth quarter was in full swing. So you're going to get much easier comps in those markets in Q3 and Q4. And you have to believe, although I will say, we haven't seen it yet that with oil prices off the bottom and moving back up, it will provide a little bit more of a stability on the demand side in those markets, but we'll have to wait and see that happen.","Rich Hightower","Right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Joe Greff of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff","I have a question for you guys on your full-year 2016 guidance, and [indiscernible] with this, when I look back at the Q1 results, you hit the lower end of the range for RevPAR growth guidance, yet you were above the higher end of the EBITDA range or above the higher end of the EBITDA range. So when I look at the full-year guidance for 2016 at the lower end to the higher end of RevPAR growth, does that correspond exactly to the lower and higher end of EBITDA growth, i.e., if you hit the middle of the road in terms of RevPAR growth, are you something a little bit north of middle of the road for EBITDA growth?","Christopher J. Nassetta","That's a very fair question, Joe, given first quarter, and if we've done our job, those should match up. In the first quarter they didn't match up exactly, in part really to do with timing on some of the timeshare stuff that moved $10 million or $12 million from one quarter to the next. It would have otherwise generally been lined up. So our guidance on both EBITDA and RevPAR were intending to match up between low and high end.","Joseph R. Greff","Okay, great. Thank you. And then with respect to, Chris, your comments about April, and maybe I missed this, but did you actually talked about what April month-to-date RevPAR growth was and could you talk about it [indiscernible]?","Christopher J. Nassetta","I did not and I don't want to get into month-to-month too much, but here's what I'd say. Relative \u2013 April is trending sort of at or a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter, so a lot better than Q1, and in the places that you want to see it, good group base but also corporate business coming back.","Joseph R. Greff","Good enough. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley","Chris, in the prepared remarks you mentioned a little bit about the 'Stop Clicking Around' campaign and some of the success you've had across the metrics. That's something that I think you are likely to probably hear more about as time goes forward. Could you give us a little perspective here, number one, how big is the direct booking channel for Hilton on their Web-sites and apps relative to the OTA channel? And then secondarily, where does the benefit here accrue, does it accrue to Hilton or is it really more of a pass-through to the owners but helps the brands in the long-term?","Christopher J. Nassetta","I think it helps everybody. I think here's the underpinning of it, Shaun, is that we're trying to deliver the best value and best experience for our customers, and what Stop Clicking Around is really intended to do is in a fairly loud way admittedly make it clear to customers how they are going to have the best experience and where they are going to get the best value because I think not all customers really understand that, okay. So we're trying to put an exclamation point on it, and I think if you look at the stats early days, but if you look at the stats in the first quarter, I think it reflects that customers are getting it and that so far we're having very good success, but it's a long-term strategy and you definitely will hear more about it.","In terms of what's the beneficiary of it, I think everybody benefits from it. In the end I think the customers benefit because they are going to get a better experience and they are going to get a better value. Clearly the system, all of our owners benefit because in the end it is a much more \u2013 not only do their customers end up happier because it's a better experience and they get a better value but they get that value at a lower cost because our direct channels are the most efficient way to distribute our product.","And so, yes, the largest benefit is really going to flow through to the system, meaning all of our owners, and we are obviously very serious about not only driving market share at the highest levels as described in my prepared comments, to drive returns to owners and incremental growth for us but driving the best bottom line possible. The more that we can have a direct relationship with our customers, the more efficiently we can distribute our product and our owners' product, the better their returns are going to be, the happier they are going to be, the more hotels they're going to build into the system.","In terms of percentages, I would say our direct channels are sort of a quarter of our business and growing at a very rapid pace. The OTAs are plus or minus kind of 10% of our business. So our direct channels are significantly larger than those channels, and as I described in my prepared comments, growing at this point at a much faster pace.","Shaun C. Kelley","And just to be clear, the direct channels are excluding property direct and call center, all that, this is just the web?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Correct. These are online. This is Hilton.com and the app, mobile and online.","Operator","Our next question will come from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","You mentioned that everything froze in the first quarter, yet easy comps in the second half. I think a big concern is the decelerating industry demand. Would you expect a V-shaped recovery or a steep acceleration in the industry demand in the second half?","Christopher J. Nassetta","That's hard to say. I mean I think you're going to see an acceleration in demand unless something else goes wrong. I think we're already starting to see the early signs of that. How to describe it as a V or U, I don't know. I'd probably describe it as U, but a long U.","Again, I wasn't trying to suggest \u2013 I think it's very positive. I think we see great telltale signs that it's happening. I think just \u2013 I say to our guys here, common sense tells you it's going to happen because it wasn't just the beginning of this year, the end of last year we went into a deep freeze and we definitely have been witnessing a [sign] [ph] across the broader economy. That just have to ultimately drive incremental business.","Exactly how much, it's hard to see. That's why we've been I think tried to be quite reasonable in giving a range of outcomes that are not suggesting a big steep V-shaped recovery but certainly a decent uptick from what we saw in Q4 on the corporate transient and Q1.","Operator","Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes","Question for you on the performance of the Hampton Inn brand. It definitely looked like it underperformed what I would have expected based on the Smith Travel results for the quarter, and that's your largest brand by room count. How do I reconcile that underperformance versus your commentary on gaining RevPAR index?","Christopher J. Nassetta","I don't know, I'd have to dig into it, Pat, to understand it more clearly. There's nothing going on I would say. It's been a lot of time with all of the brand heads on all of the brands. I can't say I've dissected the first quarter of Hampton but there's not a broader issue and in fact Hampton did gain market share in the system. So it could have to do with \u2013 the only thing I could guess is, when you're looking at Smith Travel data, we're comp and Smith Travel is non-comp. I'm not saying that's the answer, just I'd have to dig into it.","I mean if you think about where all the new supply is coming in, it's in that segment and those are all ramping up when they come in new and it's a disproportionately large chunk of new supply. My guess is that probably explains it but I'm happy to work with our team and dig in a little bit more.","We did gain share on a comp basis in the Hampton. Hampton is doing great. We're signing up owners. I'd say Hampton is one of the most successful brands and most desired brands that exist in this space with the ownership community.","Kevin J. Jacobs","We did gain share on all brands in the first quarter, but it's just varying degrees of share gain that blended to the nearly 100 basis points that we mentioned. And as Chris mentioned, you have independents and then you have non-comp hotels in the STR data. So you can get different answers on a quarter to quarter basis.","Patrick Scholes","Okay, fair enough. Can I ask one last completely unrelated follow-up question, and that's do you gentlemen care to take a stab at what you see RevPAR being for the months of May and June? I know you mentioned April already.","Christopher J. Nassetta","Not really, no. I mean I really don't want to give the business forecasting by the month or trying to give color. I'll give you a little color though just based on what we see, it's a fair question by the way, Pat, I know you guys are looking for any forward-looking color and I would too. So I think it's fair rather than give you a number of exactly what our forecast is, what I would say is Q2 has a better group base.","That group base is distributed overall more heavily in April and June than May and we've seen as I said in April a nice uptick in the corporate business. Our sightlines in the May and June, what we do have, suggest pretty decent trajectory on that basis if everything stays as I said sort of relatively stable in the world. And so I would expect that, again I said it earlier, we're kind of forecasting a range of 3% to 5%. That means we're hoping to be somewhere around the midpoint. I think it will be distributed with April and June being stronger than May, just in part because of the group base being so much stronger in April and particularly June.","Patrick Scholes","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly","Considering the spin, I'm just curious, do you expect the leased hotels are going to stay with the brand or can they go to the REIT, and I guess in broad strokes, I know you can't be specific, how are you just thinking about the G&A load of the REIT? I'm curious if you think you could be more efficient in say [indiscernible].","Christopher J. Nassetta","I'd say on that, we're going to give you the Form 10 and you'll know where everything goes. But the overarching theory is we're trying to make all these companies really great companies and set them up for success. And so things that fit within the REIT you should assume are going to be in the REIT largely and things that don't would not.","And so I think the sum and substance of the EBITDA related to leases will end up remaining an OpCo, both because it doesn't fit within the REIT structure really because most of that is international, and importantly in those parts of the world that's how we have our tenure in those assets. Many of which that drive the largest part of that EBITDA are very important strategic assets.","So it makes sense for that to stay back in OpCo. Even though they'll be there, and you'll see when we do all the disclosures, it will be a relatively small component. The bulk of all of the real estate ownership EBITDA will be moving out.","On the G&A side, we'll give you more \u2013 I'm not going to pick on others, I think you can look at our G&A at Hilton and compare it to our competitors and given my earlier comments about we are very top line but also cost and bottom-line focused and we think we do a really good job running a tight ship. We are going to be as efficient as anybody out there. Let's leave it at that and we'll give you more color on that both through the Form 10s and supplemental disclosures that will go along with that.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly","And maybe just as a quick follow-up, in the wake of Starwood deal, do you think there's room for more consolidation to happen in the industry or do you think it's a dead topic for the foreseeable future?","Christopher J. Nassetta","You're talking about an OpCo world or\u2026","Jeffrey J. Donnelly","In OpCo world because given the number of people who [are going to be] [ph] pursuing Starwood.","Christopher J. Nassetta","I think you will continue to see more of it. There aren't tons of logical combinations when you really dig into it, but my view is you're at that stage of the cycle, I think people have figured out that scale matters, there are some that have it and some that don't and I do think \u2013 I'm not going to in any way suggest anybody is scrambling around because I don't see that, but I do think people are taking deep breaths and saying, are there things that we could do to try and get some of that scale because I think there is something to this network effect that we've been articulating prior to and since the IPO, and I think proving out in both average market share of our brands and leading organic net unit growth, and I think when people look at that, look at what others have done with Marwood, et cetera, I think it has to make them think. Now what they do, I don't know. Again, I just don't sense people scrambling around in a mad dash but it'd be surprising to me if you didn't continue to see some incremental M&A activity.","Operator","Our next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley","I actually have two questions, I'm going to try and package it as one [indiscernible]. I'm wondering on the Q1 in group, I think on your prior call you had actually said that Q1 the group was looking strong. So I wonder if there was maybe a lot of cancellation of group kind of during the quarter, if you have any color on that.","Christopher J. Nassetta","So, no. In fact what's interesting on group, I was going through the stats with the team over the last week or two, not only we are not seeing any increases in cancel or attrition activity, it's gone down year-over-year, so a very good trend. I was sort of surprised myself. I assumed it would be stable, not that it would necessarily go up, but it's actually been going down.","So I think we're mixing and matching comp sets unfortunately and that's \u2013 when I think we commented in the first quarter, I think we were really highlighting some of the bigger group assets, and what we were talking about today in terms of weakness in group and the group position was the whole system because I think everybody seems to be and should be really focused on our system-wide RevPAR growth in the first quarter and what we think for the system-wide at 3% to 5% for the full year. So it's a little bit of a comp set thing.","If you look at our big, we call them our sort of top 120, or you look at the big six assets, they did actually have a reasonably strong first quarter in group. If you take it through the whole system, group revenues were up sort of 1%,. They were up depending on the bigger hotels, they were up 3% to 4%, okay. So I think that's the differential.","Robin M. Farley","Okay, that's helpful clarification. Thank you. My other question then has to do with cancellation and rebooking, but now this is not a question about group, this is just kind of overall business and a lot of this I think would be transient, both leisure and corporate maybe, are you seeing a change in pattern, an increase in consumers cancelling and rebooking closer to the time of stay as rates come down a little bit? It's something we've heard from others and I'm just wondering if it's something that you're seeing too, if there is any way to sort of quantify how that's changing. I know you had experimented with ways to create friction on that but it sounds like it's been difficult to do [indiscernible] that the consumers are kind of resistant to non-refundable or cancellation fees. So I'm just wondering if you could sort of talk about how much that cancelling rebook behavior may have increased versus last year, that kind of thing?","Christopher J. Nassetta","I don't think we've seen a big increase year-over-year in that. I think if you look over the last two or three years, we've seen a significant increase both by customer, because of customer behavior, but also technologies and apps that have come out that have accelerated the behaviour. We did do it, and so yes, like others we have seen that trend. It's more prevalent in certain major markets around the country. It's not as prevalent throughout the system.","We do think it's an important issue. We are working hard on it. We did do the test, as I mentioned I think on one of the last couple of calls. Not necessarily that that's what exactly we want to do, but we wanted to get a sense of how our customers responded to it. We're working on a bunch of different approaches to it.","And the trick here is to do something that makes sense for customers or that's what we're in the business of doing, is serving customers, but is also thoughtful relative to how we manage the inventory for ourselves and all of our owners. We're one of the very few businesses I can think of that ties up basically all of its inventory with no downside risk, and particularly in today's world with new technologies and these kinds of behaviors, that has a cost to it. Now that cost ultimately is going to be borne at some point by the consumer. So while it may seem like it's good for them, it may ultimately not be so good.","So I don't have the answer yet. We're doing \u2013 we have all of our \u2013 as I say, we've got all our scientists working on it and we're trying to figure out as probably a little bit later this year how do we come up with a way to price our products in a way that customers understand it, it works for them for the various things, the needs that they may have but it's a more sensible way to manage inventory, and we're making some progress on it.","Nothing to announce, nothing to scare consumers about. We're not going to do dumb things relative to that don't make sense for consumers, but we \u2013 there are other businesses, there are ways to be able to look at pricing for those that need more or less flexibility and to create different sorts of pricing structure. So we'll give you more when we have it. We're very focused on it because I think it's in everybody's interest, customers and owners and the system.","Robin M. Farley","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from David Loeb of Baird. Please go ahead.","David Loeb","I promise only one question [indiscernible]. Chris, the pace of signings has been torrid but while openings have been strong, they've been a bit slower than signings. Are you seeing any issues that are slowing openings like economic issues, financing challenges, construction costs, and when do you see the pace of openings accelerating meaningfully?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Not anything dramatic. I mean there are parts of the world, China being the best example, where you have seen as they over the last year or two have sort of been evolving their economy and shifting to more of a services versus an infrastructure based economy, you have definitely seen a slowdown there relative and a lengthening of development period between signings and openings. But there's nowhere else in the world, maybe a little bit in Europe as it's had, as Europe has had its ups and downs, but broadly speaking, if I went and actually statistically looked at the timelines that we've had historically between signings and openings, they are following pretty normal patterns maybe outside of those, particularly China and about a little bit of Europe, outside of those examples. So I think so goes on the lag to the signings. You can sort of prognosticate that the openings will pick up as you get to the gestation period for development.","David Loeb","So when do you see that curve really bending up the opening curve? So when do you think we start seeing the substantial increase in openings?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Given that we have doubled our net unit growth percentage at the same time we've been growing the Company since 2007 or 2008 by 50%, I think you've been seeing it. We've gone from sort of a low point of unit growth of 3% in 2010 to 6% to 7%. So we doubled our growth rate. At the same time, the Company has gotten 50% bigger. So I'd say you are seeing it. Hopefully appreciating it.","David Loeb","We are. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Kantor Hendrix","First, I just wanted to congratulate you on Tom Baltimore. We have a tremendous amount of respect for Tom and all he has done at RLJ and we're assuming he's going to do the same for Hilton REIT, go congratulations there.","Christopher J. Nassetta","I am confident. As I said in my comments, I've known Tom for 30 years. Tom was not just on the list, Tom was the No. 1 top person on our list, and we couldn't be more pleased that he was willing to come provide the leadership of our new REIT. So it's an exciting day for all of us.","Felicia Kantor Hendrix","That's just great. I know you talked a lot around this but I want to understand the impact of Easter a bit more. You definitely discussed your outlook for an improvement in April, but how much of that April recovery what you're seeing has benefited from the Easter shift?","Christopher J. Nassetta","Some of it for sure. I mean there's no question. It'd be hard, Felicia, for me to give you an exact number at this point, maybe when we get through the month and we have, we can scrub all the data we can. There's no question the reverse impact is benefiting you, but there's also no question \u2013 and I'm not trying to pound the [indiscernible], there's no question we're also seeing broadly unrelated to that a modest pick-up in corporate transient business. It's there, I've been talking to a ton of corporate customers.","The great thaw that I described, it's going on. And what I can't tell you is like what is the result in terms of broader growth, exactly what is the shape of the uptick, but I think all things being equal meaning things stay in a relatively stable mode, it's just hard creating Easter effect, it's hard to apply common sense and not believe that you're going to see corporate transient pick-up.","Felicia Kantor Hendrix","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And just finally, Kevin, you didn't appear to prepay any debt in the quarter. I think you did that for most of last year. So just wondering, are you preserving cash for another purpose later this year such as share repurchases or is there any other reason behind that?","Kevin J. Jacobs","Yes, we have, Felicia, these two big transactions coming up that as Chris said earlier in response to Steve's question have some expense associated with them. So that's in \u2013 and also as I said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to target the same credit rating and start a share repurchase program once we get the spins or ask our Board to start a share repurchase program once we get our spins complete, but we're really just saving our cash for the transactions.","Christopher J. Nassetta","Yes, we're hunkered down to get these things done and there are a lot of moving pieces all of which are manageable but we want to sort of get it done and create three pure-play companies and we'll get back on it.","Felicia Kantor Hendrix","It completely makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","China RevPAR accelerated from 3% last quarter to 8% this quarter. Did that surprise you at all? And you didn't change your guidance for the year. So just trying to hear your latest thoughts.","Christopher J. Nassetta","It did honestly surprised us to the upside a little bit. In talking to our China teams, I talk to our teams constantly around the world, they were a little bit surprised and part of what's going on is just sort of part of the great thaw. The reason for the great thaw is I think there is a little bit more stability in the Chinese economy. Certainly the world is starting to settle down on China. I think if you're in China, which our guys are, and operating running businesses I think, it feels like things are to our teams more stable, the business is showing up.","And so, yes, we feel pretty good about what will happen for the year ahead. I'm not going to say we're being conservative. It's not going to make a huge difference in the numbers. Therefore a little off given it's a relatively low percentage of our overall EBITDA. But things are reasonably good. Surprised a little bit to the upside, not so much so that we thought we should change our guidance at this point. Some of it driven by some particularly strong group bookings and some of the bigger hotels in China, but all good. It's nothing but good.","And same thing on the development side. We shifted the strategy there appropriately a couple of years ago to more of the midscale side of things, and we're continuing when others are not to accelerate both signings and particularly accelerate openings. I think we'll probably open 20% more rooms this year than we did last and last year was I think the best year we've ever had in openings in China. So, China feels reasonably good.","Operator","The next question will come from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Chad Beynon","Just wanted to get a better understanding of what you're seeing in the first quarter and kind of going forward from a cost standpoint at your owned and managed properties with respect to labor, taxes, insurance, some of the inflationary things and kind of your outlook over the next 18 months on some of these important cost line items?","Kevin J. Jacobs","On an overall basis for the segment, we've seen cost per occupied room for the first quarter was still below 2%. So we've had pretty good cost containment there. On the U.S. hotels, we'll detail all this in the Form 10s and the like and how it breaks up, a little bit higher but we've been doing a good job of containing costs even in a wage and benefit environment that's been pretty high growth across the nation.","Operator","The next question will be from David Katz of Telsey Group. Please go ahead.","David Katz","So if you could \u2013 I think you've sort of given some pretty positive context around the development landscape. Can you talk about the financing environment for hotels which I think obviously is an important driver of new franchising deals, new management deals, what are you seeing in terms of LTVs and the size of deal opportunities, et cetera, and directionally where you think that's headed?","Christopher J. Nassetta","I'll let Kevin maybe get into more specifics because he's more active day to day and working with our owners. But at a high level, I think it's been reasonably steady. I think most of our stuff if you use the U.S. because it's a big chunk of where the development is occurring, most of it is getting financed by local and regional banks where you have owner-operator, some big, some small, that are financing with generally a decent chunk of equity or recourse on the debt. It's the way they do the business, and the local and regional banks have continued to be pretty stable.","The end of last year and very beginning of this year when all the world in my description froze up, you were starting to see little telltale signs certainly on Wall Street of less capital available. I would say in my opinion, it didn't really trickle through the main Street very much and now with the world being stabilized with a whole bunch of our owners that are building these things a few weeks ago and I asked them, you're seeing any difference in your ability. Then they said, no, maybe a teeny bit more expensive, a little bit more equity, but no real difference in sort of the mainstream kind of lending environment or nothing that they viewed as material, the best quality, developers are still able to get it and still able to finance our stuff. Kevin, I don't know [indiscernible].","Kevin J. Jacobs","Yes, I think that's a good way of describing the Wall Street versus Main Street. I mean you know the main street side of it is where the lion's share of our development is getting done, especially in the U.S. On the Wall Street side of it, I think for existing cash flowing assets, when you had the world freeze up the way Chris described it, CMBS in particular, spreads did gap out quite a bit, but those markets have re-stabilized and they are looking a lot stronger than they were.","But again on the main Street side of it, I think specific to your question about development, that is almost all local, they are highly equitised, they are financed on a loan to cost basis and it's just a little bit different environment than some of the things you've been hearing out of Wall Street.","David Katz","Got it. If I could ask one more smaller question, and I recognize that it's a smaller piece of your business, but given the split, it's relevant, we did hear a timeshare competitor talk about default activity yesterday. And I wondered if you had any perspective on your timeshare business and whether there has been any change directionally or anything notable with respect to timeshare notes and your customers in your system?","Kevin J. Jacobs","David, we saw those comments of course like you did and we have not seen that \u2013 that particular activity has not existed in our business, and frankly our customers, who is a little bit different customer, has been quite strong. So our default rates are not picking up. Our average FICO on new loans is almost 750, so a quite high credit profile for our customers. And frankly I was just looking at our default rates. We're not up really at all in the quarter. So we're not seeing that issue.","David Katz","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing thoughts.","Christopher J. Nassetta","All right, just want to say thank you everybody for spending so much time with us this morning. We continue to make great progress.

Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019re thrilled to report another quarter of strong results capping what I think was a banner year for Hilton Worldwide. For both the quarter and the year we exceeded our adjusted EBITDA guidance, we also remained very optimistic on the fundamentals and macro setup for 2015 which I\u2019ll cover a little later in my remarks.","We ended the full year exceeding the high end of our RevPAR guidance growing 7.1% system-wide on a currency neutral basis. In the fourth quarter system-wide comp RevPAR increased 6.6% on a currency neutral basis and was led by Europe and the U.S. with quarterly system-wide RevPAR growth of 6.9% and 6.8% respectively in those regions.","Much like last quarter we continue to see strong and balanced growth in both transient and group demand. This has provided the foundation for solid rate growth, but we\u2019ve also continued to capture increased volume by driving demand particularly leisure demand into non-peak periods.","Transient revenue grew nearly 7% at comp system-wide hotels in the quarter driven by bar and corporate negotiated growth of over 9% and 8% respectively. Government continued to strengthen in the quarter up 7% for the full year transient revenue also grew 7%. Group revenue growth was also strong up over 8% versus prior year in the fourth quarter and up nearly 7% for the full year in the Americas owned and managed hotels.","We remain very positive on group business going forward. In the Americas owned and managed our group revenue position is up in the mid-single digits for 2015. Strengthening group is reflected in our strong, F&B performance with F&B revenue growing over 8% at our Americas owned and managed hotels in the quarter and nearly 8% for the year this continues to be driven by the rebounding group business and a more favorable group mix.","For the year we saw a strong margin growth with system wide margins increasing a 190 basis points driving adjusted EBITDA growth of 13.5% to $2.508 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $668 million an increase of approximately 11% from the fourth quarter of 2013 and as I noted earlier both the quarter and the full year came in above the high end of our guidance.","Turning to development, we maintained our leadership position in key categories according to Smith Travel Research including global rooms under construction, pipeline size and system-wide rooms. We continue to lead the industry in net unit growth excluding portfolio acquisitions. In 2014, we added more than 40,000 gross rooms and 36,000 net rooms in 28 countries and territories contributing to 6% net growth in our managed and franchise segment.","Our 12 distinct brands across 4300 properties and 715,000 rooms driving industry leading average global RevPAR index premium of 15%. These leading premiums drive superior returns for our owners and that in turn drives greater investment and faster unit growth. And by strategically deploying our brands globally we believe that we have the capacity to grow faster in every major region of the world which our recent performance would clearly support.","Also important to note is that our leading net unit growth requires diminimous amounts of our capital, our entire pipeline of nearly 230,000 rooms requires approximately $100 million in contract acquisition cost in 5% of deals.","Our rooms under construction globally make up almost 19% of the industries total rooms under construction which is more than four times our current share of open rooms. Our pipeline increased by approximately 35,000 rooms or 17% in 2014 and includes more than 1350 hotels and nearly 230,000 rooms in 79 countries and territories.","More than half of the rooms in our pipeline are already under construction and all are in our capital light management and franchise segment. Including all agreements approved but not yet signed our pipeline totals approximately 245,000 guest rooms, again outpacing all other hospitality companies.","In 2014, we approved more than 500 deals representing more than 82,000 rooms with no portfolio acquisitions or major investments. That is more than double our gross openings for the year.","In the Americas, we signed on average more than one deal per day increasing our U.S. pipeline by nearly 30% to 100,000 total rooms. We also celebrated a number of development milestones in 2014. We welcomed our 2000 Hampton to the system, arguably the best brand in hospitality measured by RevPAR index performance in both guest and owner satisfaction, Hampton continues to distance itself from the competition. There are over 400 Hamptons in the pipeline and our recently announced partnership with Plateno hotels is expected to have hundreds of Hamptons in China over the next few years.","Doubletree by Hilton continues to be one of the fastest growing upscale brands in the industry opening its 400th property in 2014. The brand has more than doubled in size since 2007 even after we removed nearly 10% of the brand to improve overall quality. We took a largely American brand and have strategically deployed it across six continents. We now have 54 Doubletree\u2019s in Europe and 37 in Asia all where we previously had none. We have an additional 159 Doubletree\u2019s in the pipeline globally with nearly 80% outside of the U.S. and it\u2019s RevPAR index has increased over 700 basis points since 2007.","Home2 Suites by Hilton continues to gain momentum as owners and guests love it value proposition since its launch in 2009, 45 Home2 Suites have opened with another 165 hotels in the pipeline. In fact we signed nearly 100 Home2s in 2014 alone. We successfully launched two new brands in 2014, both with a large base of signed deals. Curio, a collection by Hilton includes hotels that retain their unique identity by also deliver the many benefits of Hilton system.","Curio, currently has 5 hotels open with 23 in the pipeline that would sign letters of intent. Canopy by Hilton debuted only four months ago and is redefining the lifestyle segment by creating a more accessible lifestyle brand. Canopy currently has 15 hotels in the pipeline or with signed letters of intent and we expect to open the first Canopy within a year.","On the values enhancement front late last year, we announced an agreement to sell the Waldorf Astoria New York for $1.95 billion subject to a 100 year management agreement with the buyer Anbang Insurance. As part of the transaction, Anbang also agreed to complete a major renovation to restore the Waldorf to its historic grandeur. We are very pleased to have completed this sale and as of yesterday we have closed on all five previously announced acquisitions as part of the 1031 exchange for a total of $1.76 billion.","In order to identify the properties for the 1031 exchange we conducted a very thorough process beginning before we announced the Waldorf transaction, we screened for high-quality urban and resort assets in very strong growth markets that complement our existing portfolio with the objective of maximizing long term value.","Adding the Hilton Bonnet Creek, the Waldorf Astoria Orlando, The Reach and Casa Marina Waldorf Astoria resorts in Key West and the Parc 55 in San Francisco will expand our portfolio of owned hotel in Florida Resort markets and San Francisco a key growth market.","The Parc 55 which represents over a third of the purchase portfolio by a number of rooms will be a new addition to the Hilton hotels and resorts brand. We expect that these hotels will not require any meaningful incremental CapEx in the near term.","In the end we sold the Waldorf Astoria New York at a premium multiple and we have acquired great institutional quality assets in key urban and resort markets at a blended multiple below our current trading multiple have executed the purchases very quickly and as a result have captured a very significant EBTIDA and value arbitrage.","Now, let me update you on our outlook for the year. On the heels of better than expected performance in 2014 we expect continued strong fundamentals to drive another great year in 2015 particularly in the U.S. where GDP growth forecast were recently revised upward. We think this bodes especially well for our portfolio given that 78% of our adjusted EBITDA comes from the U.S. market. The year is off to a good start and while there has been some disruption due to the weather, we still expect to have a strong first quarter.","For the year we expect mid to high single digit RevPAR growth in the U.S. supported largely by a strengthening economy, a gradually improving labor market, rising corporate profits combined with below average supply growth. We expect strength in San Francisco, Florida, Chicago and Boston continued recovery in Washington DC and ongoing challenges in New York.","For the Americas region outside the U.S. we anticipate mid single digit RevPAR growth for the full year given strength in Mexico and Ecuador tempered by some softness in Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. We expect performance in Europe to remain generally stable with RevPAR growth in the mid single digits for 2015, our guidance assumes solid fundamentals in the Western and Southern regions boosted by strong group business. Continuing uncertainty in Russia and the Ukraine however will likely pressure performance in the east while France remains soft.","The Middle East and Africa region continues to recover nicely with improving economic growth likely to drive mid to high single digit RevPAR growth for 2015. Egypt in particular is showing great momentum with some headwinds on the Arabian Peninsula from less Russian inbound demand.","Finally in Asia Pacific, we remain optimistic due in part to strengthen Japan and India and a positive momentum in Thailand. In China we expect relatively strong RevPAR in the 6% to 8% range and overall regional RevPAR growth in the high single digits for 2015.","Overall our anticipated growth rates for 2015 around the world are largely stable to increasing compared to last year, that leads us to be optimistic about the year expecting a system wide RevPAR increase of 5% to 7%, about two-thirds of that driven by rate. ","We continue to expect net unit growth of 40,000 to 45,000 rooms for the year or 6% to 7% increase in management franchise rooms. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2015 is $2.79 billion to $2.87 billion reflecting the sale of the Waldorf Astoria New York, the subsequent completion of the 1031 exchanges and changes to our adjusted EBITDA presentation which Kevin will cover in more detail shortly.","In summary, we feel great about performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2014, and also feel great about the setup for this year in addition to strong industry fundamentals.","Our company\u2019s specific attributes including large scale and unmatched geographic and price point diversity that create a loyalty effect should continue to drive market share premiums as well as topline, bottomline and net unit growth outperformance.","With that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Kevin to cover things in a little bit more detail.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris mentioned we are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter which meet our expectations. In the quarter system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 6.6% on a currency neutral basis driven by 3.1% increase in average rate and a 2.3 percentage point increase in occupancy to 71%.","On an actual dollar basis, system-wide RevPAR increased to 5.3% in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items totaled $0.17, an increase of $0.06 over the fourth quarter of 2013, driving by higher operating income and lower interest expense partially offset by higher income tax expense.","Total management franchise fees were $383 million in the quarter, an increase of 15% over the fourth quarter of 2013 driven by both topline and net unit growth.","Total fee growth was over 15% for the year, exceeding our guidance. We continue to see strong growth in our base, incentive management and franchise fees which increased 11%, 20%, and 17% respectively for the year.","As new hotels enter our system at published franchise rates that average 5.4% and existing hotels re-license or change owners and step up to those published rates, our effective franchise rate continues to increase growing 10 basis points for the year to 2.65%.","There are ownership segment, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $269 million, an increase of 6%. For the year, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1 billion, and when adjusted for a non-comp increase in affiliate fees and a onetime gain, one time gain on a least we were bought out of in the first quarter of last year with 10% higher year-over-year.","Operating margin growth at Americas owned and managed hotels grew nearly 150 basis points for the year.","Our timeshare adjusted EBITDA of $102 million in the quarter was 11% higher than prior year. This was primarily driven by higher third party sales and commissions including a successful start to sales at the fee for service Grand Island [indiscernible] Hilton Hawaiian Village.","Lower SM G&A expense, higher transient rental and improved club margins, early registration of New York time share units benefited the fourth quarter by approximately $12 million in adjusted EBITDA which we expect to reduce first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA by the same amount.","We continue to gain great traction in transitioning our time share business to a capitalized business with 66% of intervals sold in the quarter developed by third parties. Our inventory includes over 130,000 intervals or about six years of inventory at our current sales pace, 82% of which is capital light.","Over 60% of our time share sales are now from new rather than existing time share owners essentially the inverse of our competitors which should drive strong, more sustained system growth over time.","Finally our corporate and other segment was $293 million for the year on the low end of our guidance of 3% to 5% increase.","Growth across all regions supported favorable results in the quarter. Strength in the Americas continued as expected especially in the U.S. RevPAR increased 6.8% in the quarter with the rate gains accounting for just over half of that growth.","Results were driven by both continued strong transient demand as well as accelerating growth in group revenue at our full service hotels, as expected calendar shift somewhat tempered growth in November.","RevPAR our U.S. owned and managed properties rose 7.3% in the quarter due to robust group performance in the San Francisco Chicago and Los Angeles markets where group revenue increased between 15% and 25%.","Our Hawaiian properties has also benefited from strong group business posting over RevPAR growth in the quarter. While our hotels in the east benefited from strength in Florida and Boston, solid momentum also continued in DC given particularly strong transient business.","In the Americas outside the U.S. RevPAR grow at solid 6.5% for the quarter as transient strength drove meaningful ADR increases in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia offsetting softness in Porto Rico as a weak group business weighed on rates in the market.","Moving into Europe, a gradual recovery led to regional results that were modestly better than the third quarter. RevPAR grew 6.9% in the quarter driven by a 330 basis points rise in occupancy and a 2.2% rise in rate.","Additionally, growth accelerated versus the regions 5.7% average RevPAR increase over the prior three quarters. Results were boosted by a especially strong group business in the U.K. and Rome coupled with steady fundamentals in Germany, but we\u2019re somewhat hindered by persisting challenges in Eastern Europe were declines in Israel and Russia offset strong performance in Turkey.","Ongoing economic issue in France pressured fundamentals resulting in continued softness there. Sustained improvement in the Middle East coupled with easy comparisons offset softness in Africa, and resulted in strong RevPAR growth of 6.7% in our Middle East and Africa region in the quarter, meaningfully, ahead of the 3.6% average increase over the prior three quarters.","Growth was entirely occupancy driven and largely supported by a robust performance in Egypt which benefited from large group volume and easing comparisons and mitigate the effective weakness in Arabia and Pennsylvania, which suffered from a slowdown in Russian demand.","Increased competition hurt fundamentals in Saudi Arabia, while Ebola related travel restriction adversely impacted our hotels in Africa. In the quarter RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region grew 2.9% partially driven by lower group business in Mainland, China which posted 2.8% RevPAR growth.","Full year RevPAR growth in China remains strong at nearly 6%. Fundamentals in Japan remain solid with RevPAR of roughly 8% in the quarter and in Australia as well with RevPAR gains in the mid single digits benefiting from the G20 Conference in Brisbane.","Southeast Asia continue to struggle with high resort fail short of expectations offsetting encouraging signs in Bangkok where demand finish ahead of expectations over the vested period.","Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $768 million of which $202 million is restricted. Asset closing of the Waldorf sale and the 1031 exchange acquisitions, we fully repay the $525 million mortgage of the Waldorf and assume $450 million mortgage on the Bonnet Creek Resort reducing leverage by about $75 million in the process.","We continue to use substantially all of our free cash flow to repay debt and in turn, build equity value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we made voluntary prepayment of $300 million on our term loan which brought our total voluntary debt prepayments to $ billion year, and our overall net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.2 times.","Our leverage target continues to be 3 to 4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. With our expected EBITDA growth in 2015 including an incremental contributions from the completed 1031 exchange, and anticipated voluntary debt prepayments of $800 million to $1 billion.","We expect to be within our target range during the second half of the year. At that point, we will explore returning capital to the shareholders most likely starting with the introduction of a dividend.","Before we get into our outlook for 2015, I want to take a minute to discuss the impact of the strengthening dollar on our results. Over 80% of our full year 2014 adjusted EBITDA is in U.S. dollar or currencies peg to the dollar.","Other than hedging certain of our unit company exposures that is not our policy to actively to hedge our cash flow. Our FX exposure is somewhat offset by in region overhead in CapEx, but given the recent sharp movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Australian dollar and yen, we\u2019re expecting $35 million to $45 million of FX impact to our adjusted EBITDA outlook and have built in to our 2015 guidance.","Turning to that guidance, as Chris mentioned our system-wide RevPAR guidance is between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to be between 4% and 6% on the same basis.","To facilitate comparison with our competitors we will revising our presentation of adjusted EBITDA going forward to add back all non-cash share based compensation expanse.","All of the guidance that I will walk through in a moment is based on the revised adjusted EBITDA presentation as well as the completion of all 1031 exchange transactions including the approximately $100 million of remaining Waldorf sale proceeds with which we intend to purchase one or more additional U.S. based strategic assets within the next six months.","With that, we are expecting an adjusted EBITDA range of between $2.79 billion and $2.87 billion for 2015. We expect diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $0.78 and $0.83 for the full year.","We expect management franchisee growth of 11% to 13%. We expect time share EBITDA of between $335 million and $350 million. And for the corporate and other segment to be roughly flat for 2015.","CapEx spending excluding time share inventory is expected to total approximately $350 million to $400 million including about $265 million to $285 million in hotel CapEx which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue.","For the first quarter of 2015 we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis driving management and franchisee growth of 11% to 13%.","We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $555 million and $575 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.10 to $0.12. Further detail on our fourth quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks and we\u2019re now interested in answer any questions you may have. So that we may speak to as many of you possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Sally [ph] could we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Carlo Santarelli","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking question. Just doubling back Kevin to your comments on Europe, obviously the results in the quarter plus almost 7% on RevPAR basis were impressive. Are you guys and I know you call that a little bit pockets for 2015 where you\u2019re expecting strengthen and some softness, nut as you think about in the quarter, could you kind of identify maybe where some of that strength came from.","And then, in addition as you think about your guidance for next year in the FX headwinds which you\u2019ve quantified, have you guys thought at all about the impact of the dollar appreciation and inbound travel to the U.S on any specific markets?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Sure, Carlo. On Europe I think you\u2019re asking about the outlook and I think we expect to continue to see strength where we\u2019ve seen it. In Western Europe, a little bit in Southern Europe tempered by discontinued difficulties in Eastern Europe and certain market like France. But generally speaking, we think the trends in Europe are positive and we\u2019ll continue in that direction which is reflected in our guidance.","On the FX side we have \u2013 we continue to think about FX as I mentioned historically we\u2019ve not hedge our cash flow exposure. Those remains a relatively small portion of the business than although $35 million to $45 million is more than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years for FX, given what I would view is relatively sharp movements recently in the dollar versus other currencies.","We\u2019ll continue to look at that. And if expectations are such that that trend is going to continue to be that strong, we might change course, but historically we haven\u2019t viewed it to be our job to bid on currency movement. And then in terms of impact to major markets in the U.S. so far we\u2019ve not seen really any impact at all.","Carlo Santarelli","Great. Thank you. And then just quickly if I could. As you guys do think about, I know, Kevin mentioned, the second half, the institution of dividend, when you try and think about the investment grade rating and you think about the various uses of capital, what kind leads you to the conclusion that dividend would be your preferred means of capital return at this stage?","Chris Nassetta","Carlo, it\u2019s Chris. I think as Kevin said in their prepared comments, where we think we would start, I don\u2019t think we view certainly intermediate or longer term that it is the only way that we should return capital. We are committed to our leverage goals of being three to four times and I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent about that and consistent that when we get there. We think that that is the strength of balance sheet that gives us all the optionality that we need and get time and bad in it.","Once we get to that point, we didn\u2019t want to overcook the balance sheet and we\u2019d be looking to start to return capital. And we\u2019d be looking to do that initially with the institution of a dividend and to get in sync with our competitive set and then to the extent that we had excess cash flow beyond that and within the constraints of being at our targeted leverage levels, we would look to other forms of return on capital.","I think in today\u2019s world that would \u2013 it look like a stock buyback, but I think at the time we actually instituted obviously we\u2019re going to get as good a sense for the marketplace as we can as to what people are looking for as shareholders to return the excess cash flow of the company to the owners of the company.","But I think the first step I think we always thought is to get synced up with having a modest dividend, because our competitive set does and our sense is it would be good to open to another base of investors in the sense of getting yield investors and to be synced with our competitive set as we talk to investors out there.","Carlo Santarelli","Understood. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis","Hey, good morning, guys.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning. Harry.","Harry Curtis","Chris, a question that we seem to get more often than not is your view on the lodging cycle. There is some view that it will be over within the next year or two. Just generally can you give us your thoughts on how this cycle might be different than prior cycles?","Chris Nassetta","Harry, I sort of remained very optimistic about where we are in the cycle sort of mid cycle and not to over simplify, but it\u2019s sort of driven by the laws of economics. I think using the U.S. as a surrogate, because it is nearly 80% of our business. What we see in this market, we see broadly around the world, as I said, its either stable or getting better.","And we see in the U.S. market a demand equation that\u2019s getting modestly better as broader economic growth is getting better, which we think is going to continue to drive very strong trends in results. Group business is coming back as we\u2019ve seen and reported both last year and as we look at position in pace coming into this year. So we think driven by broader economic growth demand, demand is growing and it is still being matched by historically low levels of supply, 2.5% is the 30-year average. Last year it was 1%, looks like this it will be a bit over that, but still far below the 30-year averages in a market condition where demand is growing modestly.","That leads us to be quite optimistic about the next several years. One of those things has to change materially for us to be less optimistic and I at least don\u2019t see that in the horizon over the short to intermediate terms. So we feel good about it and the results that we delivered last year, sort of the setup we see in real time in the business happening today in pace and position going forward, all generally support that. So, again, just driven by basic economic, we feel very optimistic.","Harry Curtis","Excellent, and then second question. Going back to your comments about the dividend but in a bigger topic which is value creation strategies, on the dividend are there any moves that you can make with respect to corporate structure that make sense at some point in the next year or two that would create incremental value?","Chris Nassetta","Be more specific.","Harry Curtis","REIT\u2019s spinoff?","Chris Nassetta","That\u2019s what I thought you were asking. But I just wanted to make sure.","Harry Curtis","I was too subtle, sorry?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. Now I know. We certainly have been asked that a few times and talked about it, including on most of our earnings calls. And I think our view is the same which is we are constantly looking at the real estate obviously to maximize the value like we\u2019ve done with the number of our big value enhancements opportunities most recently the Waldorf creating a huge value arbitrage.","And we look at the bulk of the remaining real estate to think about how we maximize that in terms of operations, value enhancement, ROI opportunities, but also is there an opportunity structurally to sort of separate the businesses in a way that would create value.","With the underlying sort of emphasis, it\u2019s an obvious statement, but we\u2019re saying that it\u2019s all about maximizing value and creating value, so that is how we look at it. When we look at it including recently and we look at sort of a tax efficient way of doing its likely throughout structured transaction of a separation of the business which then starts to, in the analysis, require you looking at a market basket of multiples in the opco\/propco world.","When we look that, while there\u2019s been a little bit more separation over the last three or four months, reality is when you look at a market basket, there is not enough separation relative to the incremental cost \u2013 onetime cost of doing it and incremental cost of having two entities or enterprises versus one where on paper, we think that there\u2019s a significant value arbitrage.","We are not resistant to the idea I think to the contrary. We are really driven just by the ultimate value arbitrage. We don\u2019t see it at the moment as being meaningful arbitrage to the extent that we \u2013 if that changes, we will be the first be interested in pursuing the option.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Thanks, Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Joel Simkins","Hey, good morning, guys. I have to ask the obligatory time share question. Obviously your business is striving, you looks like you\u2019re going to be the only major lodging company with a captive time share business. And Chris, what you\u2019re thoughts on that business and at some point would you also contemplate a spin there?","Chris Nassetta","Well, I knew we would get that question, and it\u2019s a totally fair question given what others have been doing. I\u2019d say again, I\u2019d start comment by saying, our objective and job is to maximize value. So to the extent there are things that we should be thinking about structurally from the standpoint of the engineering of the company if you will that would create more value, assume that we\u2019re going to be looking at those things, real estate time share or any segment of the business.","Having said that and you sort of implied it, Joel, in your question. We think our time share is different. I know everybody would say they are different. But we think it is different and special in the sense that we set out a course four years ago to really transform that business and get out of the capital intense part of it and make it much more like the management and franchise business which is such a profitable high margin business.","And we have had tremendous success if you look at the numbers, the majority of the sales now are in the capital light segment. The amount of capital that were absorbed, that were consuming that businesses is a fraction of what it\u2019s been and going down. We\u2019ve grown our inventory by 60% in the last year. We now six years of inventory, Kevin covered it over 80% of which is capital light, which I think gives you a sense of where the business is going in terms of consuming capital and overall returns as the capital need goes down. And importantly it\u2019s our most loyal customer in a sense of not just being loyal, they love our time share business, but they are very active supporter of the hotel side of the business spending a huge amount of money in the hotel side of the business.","So for all those reasons, we like the time share business, because I think our business is different and we\u2019ve done I think a good job of transforming into something that looks and feels a lot like the rest of the business and we think should have a value that looks and feels more like the rest of the business.","But in the end we are all about creating value and so we are \u2013 that\u2019s the view. We\u2019re committed to the time share business, but we\u2019re also always have our eyes open and always trying to be thoughtful about any opportunities we have to continue to create more value for shareholders.","Joel Simkins","Sure. And one quick follow-up, obviously your domestic pipeline continues to be strong. You have some lot of competitors out there. You have some people trying to play catch-up. As we get little bit deeper into cycle and there\u2019s incremental competition for franchising deals.","Are you seeing some of the terms struck out there change? And does that have \u2013 would that require you guys to commit some capital to any future deals?","Chris Nassetta","Not really, and not materially. I mean, I think again this sort of self-promotional for the company, but it happens to be true, I think the strength of our brands speaks for itself. Average market share of 115%, most of what\u2019s getting done in the U.S. is in the limited service pace. We have pretty much either at the top or category killer brands in terms of market share. And you\u2019re entering into multi-decade sort of agreements with people and I think they care deeply about what that ultimate performance is going to be.","And I think that\u2019s the reason why we are getting a disproportionate share of the development in the U.S. because of the strengths of those brands. We do occasionally, obviously do the supplement for important strategic deals with key money mostly very rarely another else. I haven\u2019t seen any dramatic pattern either way.","I think probably the best sort of best news or harbinger of things to come is we've actually been successfully been moving our average franchise rates up. So if you really get down, most of what\u2019s getting done in the U.S. almost everything getting done in U.S. is limited service and its franchise, our pricing power has been growing, not shrinking in terms of what we actually able to charge owners and get them. They continue want to sign up with us and build our hotels because of the strength of those brands.","So sure, long-winded -- short-winded way of saying what I just said is, we haven\u2019t seen any \u2013 we\u2019re still having great success in the U.S. I haven\u2019t seen any real material difference. We signed as I\u2019ve said on average one deal a day last year. So we\u2019ve got good momentum coming in the 2015.","Joel Simkins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. Two questions. First, can you give a little color on your China RevPAR guidance for next year is up 6% to 8%? I don\u2019t know what it was in Q4 specifically, I mean, it\u2019s in the Asia [ph] category. But if you could give a little color on that specially and then I guess what would be driving the acceleration in 2015 in your view, because I don\u2019t know that sort of the genera view of the economy there is looking for acceleration?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. For the full -- that\u2019s good question, Robin. For the fourth quarter for a bunch of sort of hotels specific reasons we were in the 3% range. In China for the full year we were sort of six, six plus. We think it\u2019s sort of in that range, again this year on a comp basis and has a lot to deal with sort of where our hotels are both sort of diversity of the market as well as the individual locations in those markets.","We\u2019ve had a good \u2013 I mean, China is obviously seen some slowdown in broader economic growth. It\u2019s still one of the highest growing markets in the mid to high single-digit in the world and while, we have seen RevPAR growth rates temper over the last two or three years. We are still managing to drive pretty healthy growth and we think we will. The other thing that sort of happening in China which is nice to see early days is as you starting to the food and beverage side is up a little bit.","So we\u2019re watching that very carefully with a lot of what\u2019s being going on there, sort of government posterity setting the tone for the broader market. You\u2019ve seen ancillary spend really impacted over the last couple of years. As I talk to our teams in China, real time talk to our team over there every week. It feels like \u2013 they feel that they are at the beginning of a little bit of a recovery, the purse strings are loosening up a little bit more in the ancillary spend area.","So I think China, I think a good story I think from a growth point of view, continue to make really good progress. We signed more deal with the China in 2014 than we did in 2013. Now the complexion of those deals was different. It was a much heavier component of limited service, which is what we have been sort of planning on and driving towards, because we think that we\u2019re going to get broad distribution. So, we feel good about the China story, but the specific answer, is it relates to individual assets and markets and locations, but we feel confident in that range.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. And then my other question was, your incentive fee growth, I guess what's embedded in the total fee guidance for 2015, is that 11% to 13%? Because with incentive fees, its look like they were up really strongly in Q4 and is that something that we should see it for moving here later into the cycle that we would see accelerating?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, Rob. I think that we have a couple of one-time items that affected both 2014 and that are going to affect 2015. But if you unpack that really for both years it\u2019s kind of high teens growth rate, and that is something that as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, as we open up more managed deals outside the U.S. that are internationally format with IMF that\u2019s based on percentage of GLP versus the more standard U.S. format which is based on clearing and owners prior to return hurdle, you should see that growth rate accelerate, but if you unpack again the onetime items, the growth rate is relatively \u2013 is basically the similar for 2014 to 2015.","Robin Farley","And was there a big change then in the U.S. hotels paying incentive fees, that what percent at this point?","Chris Nassetta","It broadly moved up into the high 50s from sort of the low 50s and we expect contribution rate to go from the high 50s to the low to mid 60s in 2015.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the color on the regional RevPAR expectations for 2015. But just focused on the U.S., a big debate in the market is just related to the performance of kind of the higher tier hotels versus the mid tier versus the lower tier hotels. You obviously have a good mix among the chain scales. Could you just give us your expectations of 2015 of chain scale performance? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Yes. Thomas, thanks for the question. I know, we\u2019ve been answering that lot. I\u2019m going to maybe oversimplify, but I think it will get to the answer you\u2019re for. We look at last year obviously, I\u2019d sort of break it down to for upscale and above and mid scale and below, because I think that broadly is sort of where you\u2019ve seen performance differentials. ","Last year, the lower end of the business under performed. If we look at our \u2013 if we blend that all together by about a 100 basis points the outperformed, the lower end outperformed the upper end by about 100 basis points. And that was on the sort of back of very strong transient growth.","If we look at what we expect, both what we\u2019re seeing this year. What we see in our group booking pace. What we see in the patterns on the upper upscale and above, we think that converges this year and is roughly equal when we actually blend that together. And that is because we expect continuing transient strength, but in the upper end of the hotels you\u2019re now going to start to get more of the benefit of that group base, which is not only giving you more volume and then higher rated groups, but its giving you more leverage to leverage the better transient business, because you filled the big block of rooms with group and more so than last year.","And I would expect as I\u2019ve seen pretty much in very cycle, I don\u2019t think this cycle is different in that regard. As you get beyond this year, I would think it will flip around. I think you\u2019ll have the higher into the business outperform. But this year our best numbers are saying a consistent level of performance between the average of those two big segments.","Thomas Allen","Okay. And then just on your \u2013 the five assets you recently bought. I thought it was interesting that you bought two hotels in Orlando and you\u2019ve been kind of shifting exposure away from the New York market. Can you just give some more color on kind of your expectations A, around Orlando, and the strength of that market, then also on New York?","And then just an update on your relative exposure now that you sold the Waldorf and you bought those other assets? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Yes. I will take the last one first. Our relative exposure in New York going from 8% to little less than 5% on New York centric in terms of EBITDA contribution. In terms of the assets, I would say broadly, first of all, in Orlando its really one asset, I mean, we talked about it as the Waldorf and the Hilton, but if you\u2019ve ever seen it its two towers connected by the meeting space that was built as one complex. It\u2019s an amazing complex. We\u2019ve been obviously involved from the beginning of it in a great location adjacent to Disney that has been building and building in terms of moment of the group business and being able to leverage off for that. For leisure business given its location, and we have very high expectations of the performance of that asset in that location in Orlando","Key West, the two assets, again, sort of run as one asset, it\u2019s probably in the U.S One of the hardest to duplicate locations that like you can pop up hotels in Key West. There's a pretty limited amount of land. And we feel very good about not just short term but long term value and performance on that. And then San Francisco I think everybody is pretty up to speed on San Francisco. A great asset \u2013 essentially adjacent to our existing Hilton. We can run it as basically one big hotel. We can Garner efficiencies out of both sides. We can drive by bringing in the Hilton system.","We can drive incremental market share and what is one of the strongest growth markets in the country. When you blended all together, the way I would look at it is, short intermediate term, the growth rate from a RevPAR and even a point of view is probably about double what we existed. Forgetting even the multiple arbitrage, the RevPAR growth rates on average will be in the very high sort of high single digits and the EBITDA will be in the double-digit and both of those will be meaningfully higher than what we would have experience with the prior asset.","Thomas Allen","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Joe Greff","Good morning, everybody. What continue to surprise us, nicely surprise us to the upside is the level of occupancy gains that you finished on a system-wide basis in the Americas, little bit north of 75% system-wide just below that, I\u2019m presuming that that or above your prior peak. Maybe can you talk about what you\u2019re doing to incent your managers to push price? Maybe that\u2019s a different than a year or two years ago.","And when you think about your U.S. RevPAR guidance for 2015, what\u2019s the mix there between rate and occupancy gains? Then I\u2019ve a quick follow-up.","Chris Nassetta","We have been I think a really good job on occupancy. We\u2019ve finished historically high occupancies last year. They were up to 240 basis points in occupancy. We do not think we will repeat that this year. Although I will say, embedded in our guidance is probably 1.5 points to 2 points in occupancy, which will mean, we\u2019ll be at yet another historical high. You might say, why and are you driving rates, sort of embedded in your question or the second part of your question is, are you doing enough on rate.","I think the answer is yes, and I think it is that not all days are created equal in our business, in most markets. Monday through Thursday we all know is a very different experience than Friday through Sunday, not everywhere but most places. And so what we\u2019ve really try to do with our teams in their final analysis of business is bifurcate that into being. Its supper strategic about how we\u2019re pricing in the high demand periods, and being thoughtful about how we price in the lesser demand periods, but recognizing if we can get, fill those rooms at reasonable rate that net cash flow, the properties, the bottom line is going to be better. So I know that all sounds easy, but it\u2019s not and I think the short answer is one size is not fit at all.","But that\u2019s where we\u2019re getting this occupancy gain is really a lot of leisure and a lot of weekends and some off-peak [ph] just being smarter and being more aggressive further out in time where we know we\u2019re going to have weaker periods. If you look at rate versus occupancy this year embedded in our number sort of we\u2019re going from roughly 55 \u2013 roughly 55, 45 or excuse me, roughly 50-50 to 65, 35. So there\u2019s definitely a step up. But we want. We want weekend and off-peak occupancy. And I do think we\u2019ll get 150 basis points to 200 basis points. It will obviously start to tempt \u2013 sort of there\u2019s only so much more we\u2019ll be able to do.","It will be tempered I think as we get into next year and beyond. Did I attempt that you had a lot questions embedded.","Joe Greff","Yes. You touched on it Chris. One follow-up I have and you may have said this before or I may have missed it in a lot of data points that you talked about, but looking at your system-wide RevPAR guidance of 5% to 7% that\u2019s on the currency-neutral basis. If we were to look it adjusted for where the U.S. dollar is relative to the Australian dollar and the euro, where would that be?","Chris Nassetta","It would probably be 4% to 6%, this is about a point in there probably for conversion to actual rate.","Joe Greff","Great. Thanks guys.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, in your prepared remarks you said that the group revenue position was up in the mid single-digits for 2015 for the Americas. I just wondering, could you give us the rate and volume components of that? And then also can you tell us what you\u2019re seeing both in the quarter, for the quarter bookings, and then farther out for 2016?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. The split is 50-50, plus or minus between volume and rate on the existing group position. And pace has been very strong. I don\u2019t have a first quarter pace number yet, but if I look at that same comp set that I reference that\u2019s up in the mid single digits and position, I think the pace in the fourth quarter was up over 50% -- 57% is what I recall, but very strong pace.","My impression, well, I don\u2019t have final numbers. Honestly, January and February combined I saw some very early numbers that\u2019s look like pace was strong, but I don\u2019t have an exact number at the moment.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then just along lines with that question, the third quarter 2015 looks like it faces pretty tough comps, maybe you don\u2019t have this detail on front of you, but just wondering what you might be seeing in that quarter?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. It\u2019s pretty good. I don\u2019t have the specific number in front me Felicia, my recollection is that first part of [indiscernible] group is a little bit weaker for us and the middle two quarters are relatively strong. So it is a harder comp, but we\u2019ve been pretty well.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Great. And then just as a quick follow-up. Just wondering, are you seeing any changes in RevPAR index in any of your major geographies or among your major brand?","Chris Nassetta","No. We generally have seen modest upward trajectory across the entire portfolio. If we look at our full year index increase, it was about a half a point for the system which in the world we live and going up a half a point from the high levels that we\u2019re at. We think is very strong, but generally increasing modestly across the brand portfolio, no issue of note in the sense of declines.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. Thank you so much.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Shaun Kelley","Hey, good morning everyone.","Chris Nassetta","Hey, Shaun.","Shaun Kelley","I just wanted to follow-up on the owned portfolio. You said you addressed the REIT question head on. So I\u2019ll ask a different spin, which is I think basically since we\u2019ve been doing these calls now you\u2019ve started with some time share opportunities and why you some I guess clean up at the Hilton New York in terms of monetizing some opportunity in the retails frontage there. And now you\u2019ve done Waldorf something really successful there. Is there anything else as you kind of move your focus post-Waldorf that you kind of work on in terms of monetizing or getting a little more value of what you do own in the owned portfolio?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, of course. I touch on it quickly when I talked about sort of the broader real estate portfolio on a post-Waldorf. I think there are some more \u2013 what I would sort of define as value and enhancement opportunities, which is more change of use type of opportunities. We\u2019ve talked about at least to one of those another property in Hawaii where we been with the local municipality and are pretty much done with the process or close to it to convert one of the towers at the Hilton [indiscernible] to time share. Now we have other product, we\u2019re selling in that market. So we\u2019re not in a rush to do it, but it will be great additional supply of product and I think a great way to maximize the value of that asset, which is a great hotel, but too big for the market in relative to air lift into that market, its always been too big.","We have a couple others that on various stages of sort of analysis in work that might be again components like at the New York Hilton of existing owned hotels where higher and better use, might be some component of time share. So I do believe we\u2019ll talking to you about some of those over time in the coming quarters. And then it\u2019s a big portfolio and I don\u2019t think we should under estimate that, because it\u2019s what we do every day. I should let Kevin talk because he's responsible ultimately for the real estate side as well. But ROI opportunities are not insignificant.","I know they are not sexy doing the Waldorf, obviously a sexy and we\u2019re very proud of that and excited about it, but there's lots of investment opportunities in a portfolio this large over time to make what are very modest investments that drives very, very high IRRs and so we\u2019ve been doing a number of those. I honestly think that we have an opportunity to do even more than we have done. So may not be \u2013 there are few more to come that are not insignificant, but adding up a bunch of the ROI stuff I think over time will help create lots of value.","Shaun Kelley","Perfect. And my follow-up question would be little bit of a different vain. Just any sense or direction you can give us for how many of your, I guess, new hotel agreements or kind of signed franchise agreements come from existing owners versus I guess people that are new to the Hilton system or to the Hilton family?","Chris Nassetta","I think on average around the world its 75%, I think if you look at in the U.S. it\u2019s like 90%, weak in fact, but that\u2019s order of \u2013 sort of directional right. It's the majority of the business and in the U.S. it\u2019s the vast majority of the business.","Shaun Kelley","Meaning new agreements coming from existing owners?","Chris Nassetta","Yes.","Shaun Kelley","Perfect.","Chris Nassetta","Yes. In the U.S. I think it\u2019s like 80% and I think around \u2013 if you blending the rest of the world I think its 70%, 75% stuff like that.","Shaun Kelley","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Steven Kent","Hi. I have one quick question, which is in terms of the 6% to 7% supply growth, how much of that is select service brands and how are you balancing sort of the Hilton Garden Inn versus the Hampton Inn profile and why are certain owners picking one over the other?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. In the 6% to 7% I think implied in this roughly an even split. If you look at what\u2019s under construction around the world today in our 120 whatever thousand Steve, it\u2019s about 60\/40 full service and above actually, but that given the growth in the U.S. market that will sort of flip around a little bit. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s probably 50-50, or probably very close to 50-50. In terms of HEI versus Hampton it has a lot to do, almost all to do with market demand sort of drivers.","I mean, Hampton is a slightly lower price point and slightly different product in the sense of more limited services, a little bit smaller room, little bit less than the food and beverage, a little bit less all around. It\u2019s an amazingly strong brand.","As I said I don\u2019t think there is a stronger in the business in my opinion. But it is little bit different than Garden Inn and so it really depends on the type of demand wanting a more \u2013 a simply product where there is a little bit more need for more \u2013 a little more F&B, a little bit meeting space, a little bit figure room product I think it drives towards the Hilton Garden insight. So it\u2019s really just \u2013 the demand in any particular location within a market, what do we think, what would you think the price point is that will drive the economic results.","Steven Kent","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Bill Crow","Hey, good morning guys, one quick question and then follow-up. Hi, Chris. As far as value creation and owned real estate is it possible that after you\u2019ve identified all of these additional assets in the 1031 exchange process, maybe there\u2019s an opportunity the Hilton New York or Hilton San Francisco and Towers, and exploit the global inflow of money into the U.S. looking at hotel deals to do some similar maybe obviously less dramatic fashion in the Waldorf or are asset sales beyond the Waldorf off the table?","Chris Nassetta","Nothing is ever off the table, I mean, we are always looking at the opportunity for assets sales, they have been pretty good [indiscernible] so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any really material ones that make sense. I think the Waldorf, Bill, is pretty unique in the sense of that value arbitrage opportunity. The Hilton New York is a New York asset but I don\u2019t think it has the same qualities as the Waldorf that allowed us to do that. So, I don\u2019t really see that there. The other thing is, we did I think a very, very fine job and took advantage of market conditions and frankly took advantage of the fact that we were a quick all cash buyer on its supertanker kinds of assets that allowed us to drive what I would say to you is better than normal market pricing on a multiple basis.","I don\u2019t think we can do that all of the time. So we did it for almost $2 billion and we\u2019re able to put this together in a way we were \u2013 we think it\u2019s an amazing complement to our profile, the existing assets that its joining great for the growth rate, et cetera. But one, I don\u2019t think you could expect to get sort of market multiples on either the sell or the buy that would create the arbitrage that we were able to create at Waldorf. I wish that we could say we would, but I don\u2019t think that I would lead you down that path.","I think the think bulk of the rest of the real estate, with maybe some very minor exceptions, we will think about more as the opportunity to do a structured deals and think about it as a portfolio that you would build that would have good market exposure and the right market surround the country that would \u2013 that has a standalone would be a very attractive standalone.","Bill Crow","Chris, my follow-up is that we\u2019ve seen an uptick in incoming calls and potential M&A and maybe part of that is emanating from some of the news coming out from one of your peers, can you just talk about the challenges that you would envision for putting together a couple of brand companies and maybe what the benefits would be ultimately of M&A in this space?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. I mean, I can\u2019t talk about it for anybody else, so I won\u2019t. I can talk about it from our point of view. And I think one of the things that\u2019s very nice about where we are and I think from an investor point of view people should think as a real positive is that, as a result of what we have put together and how we\u2019re making it work. We\u2019re able to do what we do, which will lead the industry in the major metrics including an importantly net unit growth as a percentage of installed base without having to go out and acquisitive. Why? Because we have these amazing \u2013 we have these great scale, geographic distribution, price point distribution and brands that are underneath it, that have the premium market share in the industry and so.","And we\u2019re adding as a result of that base, we\u2019re able to sort leverage off that and add brands like Curio and Canopy and maybe other thing that we can do organically, at an astronomically high yield, because the investment to add those brands is frankly diminimus as compared to going out and becoming acquisitive and thinking about inorganic growth.","So way I think about it from our point of view is where I\u2019ve always said it, you would never say never, because that is the dumb thing for any CEO to say. If there was an opportunity that we thought that was a great strategic fit where we can create huge amounts of value, you and we would want to pursue it. But we have not been sort of bounty hunting or particularly acquisitive, because we haven\u2019t needed to be. We can deliver what we are trying to deliver which is outperformance across the board, but particularly on growth without having to do and we\u2019re doing it on a much higher yield basis that going out and buying things.","Bill Crow","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Vince Ciepiel","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question.","Chris Nassetta","Sure.","Vince Ciepiel","And my question relates to margin within the owned business. It has showed good progress in 2014, so first maybe how did that compared to your initial expectations and if there was a delta, what drove that?","And then secondly, with the Waldorf transaction how does that impact margins on a year-over-year basis for 2015 and how much core growth from a comp hotels are you assuming in the outlook?","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks, Vince. It\u2019s Kevin. I think relative to the full year for 2014 it was roughly in line with our expectations. I think in our least portfolio FX might have hit us a little bit or maybe came in a little bit lower than we thought. And then going forward we still think we can maintain pretty good margin growth in the owned portfolio. I think as Chris mentioned before the assets that we were buying do have \u2013 we do expect to have higher growth rates on the bottom line than our existing portfolio.","So it will be some improvement. But you got to remember in the context of a $1 billion business it\u2019s not going to move the needle all that much in terms of margins. They will perform better if their outlook comes true, but I don\u2019t think it will move the needle all that much on our over basis.","Vince Ciepiel","Got it. And then a quick follow-up, you mentioned FX, are you guys guiding 11% or 13% fee growth, you think about the FX headwind. What type of headwind is it to fee growth within the business and how much of that you overcoming next year?","Kevin Jacobs","60% of what we\u2019re putting into the guidance in the fee business and about 40% is in the rest of the business and that\u2019s all embedded in the 11% to 13% guidance.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Rich Hightower","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question here. Just one, I was curious for a more detail on the share based comp add backs and I know that the guidance build up in the back show some detail. It does show I think a far higher amount of the add backs relative to 2014? And if you guys could just lay out what some of the moving parts are there?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. We can take you through Rich some of the detail Christian and Jon [ph] can take you through offline, but you\u2019ll recall last year we had a onetime credit from the conversion of some of our programs related to the IPO, so that\u2019s really the difference there you see between 2014 and 2015.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Smedes Rose","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask, you might have address this, but your RevPAR and you owned assets is the point below your system-wide outlook. Is there something specifically pulling that down or is it just surprised given your enthusiastic comments around group bookings for the year?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. Smedes, there\u2019s really two factors. One is in the lease state where the FX that we build into the guidance hits a little bit harder than it does in the rest of the business and then a little bit in New York and that\u2019s it.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And then with your time share outlook, looks like it\u2019s down year-over-year for EBITDA, is that just reflective of the kind of asset light more management fee business that you\u2019re moving forward?","Chris Nassetta","It\u2019s really we mentioned in the fourth quarter we have a little bit of a timing issue on revenue recognition where a little bit more came in the fourth quarter which drove our beat in the fourth quarter and we think that that comes out sort of dollar for dollar in the first quarter.","There\u2019s a little bit in there in terms of the mix as we convert to fee for service, but it\u2019s mostly that time issue.","Smedes Rose","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Chad Beynon","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a big picture one, we\u2019ve seen some companies begin to reward travelers slight more aggressively with points and perks during the past several quarters. And recently one of your competitor is launching a free world-wide WiFi initiatives. So I guess my question is, when you went through the corporate negotiated rates a few months ago with your partners, are corporate starting to push for more perks in the industry. So maybe if you can give some color on kind of where this is going, and if that matters at all or if it\u2019s really just brands and location with your corporates that kind of roll that conversation? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","I think not to give you a short answer but I think it\u2019s the latter that you described. I do not sense and certainly from world-wide point of view that in these corporate rate negotiations or volume negotiations we\u2019re giving more away, frankly I think it\u2019s becoming more of a seller\u2019s market than a buyer\u2019s market so I think we are doing less of that not more of that, I think some of the things that you are seeing people do on Wi-Fi has to do with sort of a different objective which is continuing desire to channel shift people in the more direct channels to lower distribution cost, I think I would view that as a good thing generally for the industry and for individual players.","Chad Beynon","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yes","Operator","I would now turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Nassetta","Chris Nassetta","Well thank you everybody. We appreciate the time and attention today.

As indicated in the prepared comments, for us to get above the midpoint, we'd have to see a significant reacceleration in demand, particularly in the corporate segment, yes, I do think, we believe that the Group business is hanging in there, as we had expected.","So that's why, in the comments, we really directed people to the low to the midpoint of the guidance. And the way I would summarize it, sort of when you boil it all down, is that for now, I mean, you've had holiday shifts going on, you have some holiday shifts that are going to occur for the rest of the year. But, when you sort of neutralize all that noise, transient demand driven by business, transient demand has been sort of growing in the low 2%s, plus or minus, Group demand has been better than that and it's been without the noise sort of producing a 2% to 3% outcome, in terms of RevPAR growth. That's why, we are sort of guiding you to the low to the midpoint, was the expectation of, if you believe things are going to continue the way they have, that's what you deliver. If you think things are going to get better as a consequence of the economy getting better in the form of incremental business transient, then you could be better than that, but I think that's sort of the zone, as I say when you neutralize for the noise is that, I think we have been performing at is, essentially 2% to 3% for the reasons that I discussed.","In July, I think, the way to think about the third quarter is July in part again for holiday shift reason is weak, picks up in August, but August is August. It's not exactly the most robust travel period for us, given that the bulk of our demand is business demand and then September is much, much stronger than both July and August with a very strong Group base to support it and obviously more active business travel part of the quarter.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, Chris. Thanks. That's very helpful.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, next.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, or good afternoon.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, sorry about that.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, no problem. I am not sure if there's a question limit here, but just I guess first one is around you removed some of the language around debt reduction from your expected uses of capital, I suspect due to the spinoffs, just looking beyond that time though, looking beyond 2016, do you expect to use capital in the future to circle back and include debt reduction paydown like say in 2017 or is that to be determined?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I don't think our capital return viewpoint has changed and that's why we didn't really highlight it here. I think, we are going to as a consequence of the spins and the cost associated with that leverage up generally if you look at HoldCo a bit, but believe that as we exit the spins and go to next year, we will be able to get the leverage levels back to the stated goals of being in the low 3 times-s, which is consistent.","During that timeframe, we expect to continue of course to pay dividends. The Park will pay its dividends, RemainCo, Hilton Worldwide, will pay its dividends and then on behalf of Hilton Worldwide, we would expect early in the year to be talking to our board about a stock buyback program. We may be in order to get the leverage back down to low 3 times-s because it takes up a little bit, I would expect, we would be paying off some debt in the earlier part of next year, but we would also be thinking about a buyback program contemporariness with that.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, it's helpful. And just maybe two questions on just different demand segments. On corporate transient, does HHonors give you guys the granularity to see if some of the softness in corporate transient is more than just of a less demand and it's sort of data that's granular like a same-store customer either trading down on price point or taking fewer trips or staying fewer nights. Can you see that in your system?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we can see lots of data, but what I'd say sort of the K.I.S. rule, keep it simple. I think what's happening is, Corporate America, whether it's big companies, medium, small, I think you're just seeing lower demand. And we're getting mostly rates. So I think, what's happening is, volumes are relatively flat and rates up a little bit and I think it's a consequence of what we had witnessed as an economy, which was in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year, a significantly lower overall economic growth.","Now, I think when you get to the print of Q2, you're going to see much higher economic growth and certainly every expectation is for the second half to be better. We do know that historically we've had a lag somewhere one quarter to two quarters on sort of economic growth translating into demand growth in the corporate business. We haven't really seen it yet, but expectation I think would be when you see Q2 be stronger, and I think Q3 and Q4 eventually will flow through. Yes, it's just hard to know exactly when that occurs and we have not seen it to my earlier point in any meaningful way. We've seen positive growth, I mean we've seen transient growth as I said sort of in the low 2%s, but you'd obviously as a consequence of seeing broader economic growth pickup, like to see it flow through. And I think every expectation would eventually it will flow through, it sort of stands to reason by any historical standard.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just a last question on Group. Can you just talk about the trends in cancellation and attrition rates as well as your year for the year Group booking pace? I'm just curious what you're seeing there, effects maybe what your thinking is for 2017 and 2018 Group of shorter-term Group trends might be weakening?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We have not seen any negative activity in attrition or cancellations. And in fact in the first quarter I think we noted that it was down year-over-year, second quarter was consistent year-over-year. So there is nothing abnormal going on there. As we look at pace in the year, for the year, generally relatively strong. If you look at pace in this year going into next year and as a result what position is for next year, relatively strong position for next year and sort of up in the mid-single-digit. So, they're not indications of something going wrong in the Group side.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry, if you kind of talked about this a little bit on the earlier calls. And obviously, you're not seeing this in your development pipeline, but can you just talk about the conversations, Chris, you might be having with the development community? And how much of this deceleration in corporate demand and corporate transient RevPAR growth is having an impact on the mindset of those looking to build out or convert new supply, and how those conversations might be evolving, say, since the beginning of the year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I would say, honestly, Joe, have lots of discussions with owners across the board. And given that they're owner-operators, most of them, they're seeing what's going on with demand patterns across the board, particularly in corporate transient demand. I've not seen any material impact, and they're thinking about what they're trying to do from a development point of view. I do believe that there is generally, amongst the development community, and I happen to agree with this, a fair amount of optimism, and that optimism is based on the fact that the U.S. economy is picking up a little bit, in my earlier comment, that eventually that has to flow through to corporate transient demand by any historical standards.","So I think the development community, and I agree, thinks that it will. And while certainly, I don't think anybody is being a Pollyanna and has a view that we're going to go back to transient growth trends of the type that we saw maybe in the first half of last year or before, I do believe that people have a general belief that those trends could pick up, and that in any event, we're going to continue to see positive fundamentals, meaning positive RevPAR growth, albeit it's at a little bit lower level than what we had been experiencing, but positive RevPAR growth, simply as a consequence of continuing increases in demand, at lower levels, but increases in demand met with capacity additions that are still in the 1%s, and still below any sort of 30-year historical average.","So, I mean the financing markets generally have been reasonably strong, a couple of conversations with folks would say they're maybe having to put up a little bit more equity, maybe their spreads have had increased, but I think those spreads have come back in with the \u2013 even post Brexit \u2013 with the markets stabilizing. The debt markets have been quite strong generally, of late. So, I could go on, but I won't. Not a material change in the view of our ownership community.","And you can see from the numbers that we outlined in Tru, tremendous progress there, obviously that's a very \u2013 that's a product that's very much a value proposition, and it's a lower cost to build, lower number of rooms, lowest price point in terms of cost per room to build. But I think people feel very confident in their ability to get those deals and other deals, they're working on finance, and still have confidence that the cycle has legs to it.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please, go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Chris, I was wondering if you could just tell us what the leisure transient growth was in the first quarter and second quarter?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. It was on the higher end. I think it was in the 4%s, not quite all the way to mid-single, not quite 5%, but it was in the 4%s year-to-date.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Year-to-date. And then...","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, it was weighting up now, it's a smaller percentage of the overall mix of transient, but it was weighting up performance where the corporate side was weighting it down and that's how you end up in the low 2%s. I mean again, every month's different and you have the calendar shifts that, when we sort of neutralize it all, which is I was trying to maybe oversimplify, but I think it's helpful to think about it that way. The transient's growing in the low 2%s, Group's growing better than that, that's how you're delivering sort of 2% to 3% until further notice. Further notice being, you see something change in the economy, either positive or negative. Obviously, we're hopeful, with the broader growth picking up, that that's going to be on the positive side.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good, that's helpful. And then the strong Group business that you're seeing in September, I was just wondering how much of that's coming from the holiday shift?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Some of it's holiday shift, but it's overall strong. I can't be scientific enough to give you the exact percentages, but it's both. I mean clearly, you have the holiday shift helping September, hurting October, but you also have a very robust sort of Group funds going in any event.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, if you could look to October, I mean I know if you kind of backed out the holiday shift, if you could, do you see consistent, strong growth?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I mean October is going to get hurt by that. It's not a bad Group calendar, but year-over-year it's going to be hurt because of...","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...what's going on. Again, if you neutralize all that, honestly, the way I think about it is, all these all you had Q2, you had the 4th of July thing going on in the beginning \u2013 that affected it. Q3, you've got benefit of the Jewish holidays, you got the offsetting in Q4 but these are your comps in Q4. There is a lot of noise. I won't keep going. Either way I think about it is that Q3 and Q4 in the end will end up because of all that noise being relatively comparable in performance, certainly as we look at all the puts and takes. We think Q3 and Q4 are going to be relatively comparable.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just to put your leisure comment in perspective, what was that comping against last year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Similar. It's been very \u2013 I can get to the exact number later. I mean it's been very consistent over the last couple of years. Leisure has been good.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Leisure has been good, and generally sort of trending up mid-single digits, pretty consistently over the last couple of years.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just a final quick one, because I think this will be a quick answer, just getting back to Group and you were saying that how strong it's been. There's just been a few companies that we've heard from so far saying that they're seeing weaker short-term Group bookings particularly in terms of small corporate meetings. Are you seeing that at all?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, not in any material way that has shown up and with the data I've looked at.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Just a little bit further question on expectations for leisure transient, what are you thinking for performance for that segment for the rest of the summer?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's going to be relatively good, so I think it's going to be higher than the average of our overall transient growth rate, so let's say in the 3% to 5% range.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. One other question. When you look at for the business traveler, the various sort of customer segments, whether it's financial services, technology, who has given you the most pushback on what we say rate or demand and who are you performing better with at the moment?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I wish I could be precise, but the real truth is that the weakness is broad-based. And so, I can't really \u2013 when I talk to our sales team, which I do frequently, I can't like pick out whether it's pharma or technology or financial services, I would say again just because everybody has been experiencing in the fourth quarter particularly in first quarter, weakness in the macro environment I think it has been sort of a general dampening of demand across most industries. So, there is nothing that really comes to mind to highlight.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. I hear you. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just a quick follow-up on Group for next year. Chris, can you comment on your pace and position for next year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I thought I said it but maybe just neglected too. Pace has been relatively healthy for Group bookings this year going into next year. And position is mid-single digits. So, position is slightly stronger next year than for full year this year.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And is it your expectation or would you expect at this point in the economic cycle to begin to see that soften, several other companies have talked about Group softening a bit, but your seems to be stronger.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say it's a little bit stronger, I wouldn't say it's wildly stronger. And I think it's entirely dependent on what happens in the macro environment. We believe the broader global economy is going to pick up, and a lot of the groups in the U.S. U.S. economy is going to be stable to picking up. I think that's what you would expect to see in the Group side of the business. So, I think that's why \u2013 its' a longer lead business, it doesn't tend to vacillate up and down as quickly with changes, but I think if the economy stays, if economic forecasts are right for this year and next year for the U.S. economy, which I think consensus is 1.9% for this year and 2.2% for next year. I think the Group business will be fine, and I think you'll ultimately see a bit of an uptick in corporate transient business that will help you. It's not, in my opinion, I don't think we see on the horizon that's it's going to go back to where it was. We're not going to see corporate transient demand growing 6% or 8% which was what we were experiencing up until and through the first half of next year, but you could certainly see better than the low 2%s that we've been seeing in transient as a consequence of that. But the Group will act generally consistently with transient on a lag, I mean I think that's the way, just on a longer lag, I mean it's obviously a longer lead business.","So, transient today is really weak, because the economy stays really weak, eventually it will ripple through to Group. If the economy is stable and potentially going back up a little bit, then you'll see Group hang in there just fine.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And thank you. And just a housekeeping question on your expected leverage ratio early next year at the new Hilton, what might that look like?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We're going to have an Analyst Day or equivalent to walk through all three companies. I think the way to think about it is sans the spins the company HoldCo, would end up at about three times by year end, which would be on target. We're going to probably tick up a little over 20 bps, and then we got to split it up between the three companies. We gave guidance in that regard, which was for us 3.25 times. Hilton Worldwide 3.25 times to 3.50 times, so that's probably we think we would be in that zone. For Park, 3.75 times to 4 times and HGV generally one times and we think all three of those are consistent with sort of market norms and the respective industries where those companies and with the comps that those companies will be going against. So, 3.25 times to 3.50 times in that zone which is a little bit higher than the low 3 times-s we want to be at but I think we believe we can quite rapidly get it back down to that 3 times or close to 3 times.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Harry.","Operator","Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon. So, Chris or KJ, I was just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the owned\/leased performance lowering the guidance there to 1% to 3% that's sort of at the low end of what we are seeing some of the other lodging REITs coming in at this quarter for their outlooks for the year? What do you think the drivers are and some of the pluses and minuses when you think about the geographies that the only segment has?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Shaun, it's Kevin. I'll take that one. When you think you've seen the markets that have been underperforming in the first half of the year where we have big box hotels with relatively big exposures like New York and Chicago, so that's certainly part of it. And then we have some hotels in the ownership segment that \u2013 in parts of the world like Japan that's struggling a little bit with the strengthening in their currency, that's affecting domestic travel, places like Turkey, Istanbul where you've had geopolitical type events. So, it's a little bit spread around the world, but obviously the big box hotels in urban markets that are struggling has a little bit of an outsized effect into size of the hotels.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. And sort of maybe the flip side to that question is, seems like you're actually doing a really good job of holding margin there with just I think still up 10 basis points year-to-date. Where are you guys out on the cost side there in terms of margin's already very high, so are you starting to actually reduce cost or are you still at more of like an efficiency phase level where you still think there are more things to gain in the portfolio without actually cutting costs or moving to contingency plans?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I think it's a bit of both, Shaun, I mean what you saw on the first quarter was margins were up really strongly, 150 basis points and then obviously in the second quarter, overall RevPAR for the segment at 70 basis points makes it hard to maintain margins, and so margins were down 100 basis points. So, what you saw in the first quarter was our \u2013 we have really good cost discipline and we're sort of reaping what we sowed over the past couple of years in terms of being really efficient. And then when the revenue side gets softer, then you got to lean in a little bit more and so we are working our labor management systems, we're watching management levels, working on procurement initiatives, we'll get a little bit of benefit in the back half due to energy prices we think. And so, that all goes into the mix and that's why we think we'll still grow margins and EBITDA lower than we have in the past, but will still grow for the full year.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks. I just had two quick ones. One, through the first half, it looks like EBITDA came in towards the higher end of your range and RevPAR was at the lower end of the range. Is that primarily because it looks like timeshare has just been performing better and do you think that those will sort of align more through the second half of the year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so I think it's both timeshare and then fees. Some of the fee growth on the non-recurring fees and signing, application fees, et cetera so I do think those as you think about the full year guidance we're giving should definitely align more than we have in the first quarter and second quarter.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you specifically on San Francisco for next year, which obviously has a big downtick in Group, in Group's booking because of the Moscone Center renovations. Will you guys suffer from that or will you be able to maybe take Groups away since you have a fair amount of Group space yourself at those larger hotels that you own in that market. How is that looking...","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say that is certainly what we would hope. San Francisco with Moscone has obviously had a bit of a cooling off, still relatively strong, I mean still growing as faster, faster than any of the other major markets in the country, but instead of growing 10%, it's growing half of that this year, as we maybe a little higher than that as we look into next year, given that we do have a lot of meeting space, we do think and we do have a pretty good Group position. We do think we can take advantage of in-house Groups and continue if everything \u2013 all else being equal with the broader economic setup, we do think we can continue to drive pretty good performance there.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then finally...","Kevin J. Jacobs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, and I'd just add, Smedes, that San Francisco doesn't have any new supply to speak of and so then that makes it a little bit easier too and I think that the issues at Moscone are becoming better known. And I think they're working with the city to know when they're going to be in and when they're going to be out, so you can just do a little bit better. So as Chris said, probably not going to be gangbusters, but we think San Fran will be okay next year.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, fair to say that the case of unit addition should accelerate through the back half in order to reach your \u2013 I think you said 45,000 net adds for the year expected?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. And that's not atypical. I mean, if you look at the numbers year-to-date, we're ahead on signings, we're ahead on construction starts, and we're ahead on net unit growth relative to last year, it is not unusual that the second half of the year is heftier in terms of deliveries than the first half of the year. So, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we've given; the third quarter should be a banner quarter for openings.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Loeb of Baird. Please go ahead.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I know you talked a little bit about the direct booking earlier today, at least I've been told that. If you don't mind, just a little deeper into that...","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nobody was on the call, I thought, people heard the \u2013 anyway, we'll have \u2013 you can get the transcript.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I will get the transcript. I didn't manage to get on, but the rest...","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So sorry, we had a small problem with AT&T. Yes.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Apparently they had a lot of problems. That's fine. But just to go a little deeper into the direct booking initiative. Can you give us a little bit of color on what you think the trade-off has been in terms of what's happened to ADR versus the savings for owners, in terms of the customer acquisition cost, the booking cost?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Yes, I mean I think, at a high level, the way to think about our book direct campaign is, it's pretty simple, it's really to make sure that we're delivering to our customers the best value and the best overall experience. And we think, by having a more direct relationship with them, we are able to do that. And we also realize that we can't have a direct relationship with absolutely every customer. And so, in those cases, we certainly want to work with other intermediaries, including the OTAs, but where we can have a direct relationship and make sure they get the best value and give them all of the other things, HHonors, benefits and digital check-in and Digital Key and all those things, we think ultimately it's a better value and better experience for them.","So, we've gone on this campaign, and the one thing I want to note, that I have said on prior calls that's really important is, this is going to be \u2013 this is a long-term strategy, this isn't a flash in the pan, we're going out and doing a stop-clicking-around campaign. That's the beginning of years of effort and initiative to really evolve HHonors as a club to better serve our customers and to continue to bring more people into a very direct relationship with us. We think, if you look at the stats, when you read the transcript \u2013 sorry about that \u2013 you'll see we're having great success.","I think at a high level, you look at what's going on with HHonors membership, up 80% year-over-year. You look at the channel shift that's occurring to our direct channels from other channels, particularly the OTAs, all at the same time gaining market share, okay? So, you put all that together, I'd say we're having very good success, but it's early days clearly, this just really kicked off in February, March. It's going to go on for years. We're going to have to stay very vigilant, again, with the objective, giving our customers the best value and the best experience.","In terms of our owner community, and obviously you can speak with them. I'd say broadly, our owner community is, to say they're supportive would be an understatement. I think our owner community is incredibly focused on these issues and distribution costs and ultimately are having a more direct relationship with our customers. They have been very, very supportive, as a group, of all of our initiatives, and I believe that they are benefiting from it. If you look at it the way that we have to look at it, which is what's going on with \u2013 on a net rate basis, if you look at what's going on as a consequence of the channel shift that has occurred to our direct channels, on a net rate basis, our owners across the board, in every segment of our transient distribution, are doing better on a net rate basis, because even though, with HHonors discounts, which vary depending on day of the week and forward time, et cetera, but always there is some discount to HHonors members because they shift our channels and the cost of our channels, particularly our app, are de minimis relative to the other channels. On a net rate basis, our owners are making out in a big way.","As this continues, if we're successful, and we certainly plan to be, I think the net rate benefit is going to accelerate, and that is the objective. So I think everybody is \u2013 our ownership community is quite supportive. I'm sure like anything, you could find somebody that's not, but I think we're really focused on this. They for years, together with us, have been focused on making sure that we have good strategies in place, to make sure that our distribution costs are reasonable.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, just to follow that up, I do appreciate the comments about the net rate, that's kind of where I was going. If the HHonors' share of occupancy is 56% now, what's the sort of theoretical limit, or the optimal, for where that can go?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The higher, the better. I don't think there is any reasonable limit. I think if we do our job over time, HHonors should be a club for everybody. HHonors should be a club for those that are frequent travelers, those who are infrequent travelers. Obviously, the more frequently you travel, the more benefits you may get, but there should be benefits to all travelers and I think we could have a much, much higher share of overall occupancy than in the mid-50%s ultimately. But again, I want to reinforce that I am absolutely happy to talk about this and should talk about it every quarter. We're going to be talking about this for years. This is not going to be like a quarter or two quarters and okay, that's over. This is a long-term strategy that our company has.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's great. And finally, look, not for your fault for the technical issues, not holding you accountable.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm holding Christian accountable for the record.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","And the next question will come from Rich Hightower of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question here.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","So, just to go back to the spin transactions for one second here. I think previously whether on these calls or offline calls, you guys had mentioned potentially doing some opportunistic capital transactions in advance of this. So, just I'm wondering if you could add any color to what those might be. And just any additional detail would be helpful.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not in a position to give you a whole lot more detail at this point, Rich. I'd repeat what we said before which is we're in a position thankfully where we don't have to do any financings to accomplish the spins, though, we may very well want to opportunistically particularly given the strength for the debt market. And we are considering a whole bunch of options right now. And when we have more detail, we'll obviously get back with you.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thanks, Chris. That's it from me.","Operator","The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Bill.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Christian is always to blame, I think. Chris, three very quick topics hopefully, following up I think it was Joe's question earlier on the development pipeline and then whether you've seen any impact. Do you guys measure the time that elapses between signings and actual construction start? And has there been any change in that over the last year or two years?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do measure that and it has extended a little bit, but that's been more, if I look at the granular data, it's a lot more to do with China than anything, lot of the big projects in China that are in the pipeline, even some that are under construction. They're just slowing, just the pace is slowing. There are not as many workers on the sites. They are just taking longer to get it done and you've seen more delays. I'd say outside of that, not a whole heck of a lot of difference than the last year.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, I know, Chris, you're really involved on the government relations front in marketing for the industry. And lately, the headline seemed to point to momentum shifting against your B&B, just wondering if you had any thoughts on that topic?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not anything particularly new. I think all the headlines do a reasonable job of covering. And I think the industry's perspective, if I were to encapsulate it is that just having sort of a fair set of rules that apply to everybody, and I think that's a belief that's held by many of the municipalities around the country. And like a lot of the sharing economy companies that are out there, the rules and regulations haven't really kept up. They are moving faster than many of the government entities, both locally and federally can move. And so, I do think over time you're going to find that those two \u2013 that the government side of it catches up with it and ultimately that you have sort of balanced rules and regulations that apply to businesses that have similar attributes.","So, I think you're going to see, I mean, Airbnb is a real business, a good business is going to be around, they are obviously growing very rapidly, I think, increasingly you are going to see either by self governance or otherwise, that the set of rules that they are playing by are going to look more like the set of rules that we play by.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. And then finally, Chris, I know special corporate negotiated rate businesses is just a part of overall corporate demand, but there were several companies saying that last fall's negotiations were as good as they have been for the cycle and here we are with a real void in corporate demand. So, two-part question, are we making more of that negotiating period than we should be as even material? And number two, are we entering this fall negotiation period at more of a position of weakness?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've been talking a lot about that because we are talking to our sales teams about the discussion that's going to start to hit in the high gear late summer or early fall. I think, you can interpret everything we said about weakness in demand in that space, while special corporates are maybe 20%.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","10%.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","10%.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","20% of that corporate business, so 10% of the overall business, it's meaningful, it's not as big I think it ultimately is as people think. I do think in a weaker environment, it's going to be tougher to push rates and, I think, if last year, we were all sort of in the mid-single digits and pushing above frankly, our objectives were mid-single digits to high single digits.","I think, it's this year, likely we are not there, but likely going to be in the low single digits to mid-single digits, that's where sort of rationally, I think, we can expect to be. We will see. It's not going to really get going in earnest until September, October. We'll see what's going on in the broader macro environment to see if things have picked up a bit, but I think, 3% to 5% would be a rational expectation, with what I see sitting here today.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","The next question will come from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Two questions on RevPAR. First, it looks like occupancy swung positive, which I think was in line with your commentary on the prior call. Curious what the full year move from 3% to 5% to 2% to 4%, is that more driven by rates or occupancy? And then second...","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's almost all rate. I mean, we did flip back around on occupancy and, I think, our actual forecast show a tiny amount of occupancy, but it's almost all rate, so almost a 90%-plus rate in the guidance we've given you.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then, second, for your second half RevPAR outlook, would you expect international or North America to lead RevPAR growth?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say that when you blend it all together, I haven't done the math in my head, it's probably going to be comparable, simply because international, you've got the Asia Pacific that will clearly lead the world with continuing relative strength in China, and still in Japan, while Japan's cooled off a bit, it's still relatively strong. You're going to see Europe, you know, weaker, you are going to see Middle East\/Africa weaker, so when you blend strong Asia with weaker other regions against America, my guess is, it could be about the same, I mean we could do a little bit more refined math, but I think that's plus or minus, what I would say.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","The next question will come from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Research","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me. I just wanted to focus on fee growth, particularly the IMFs in the quarter and kind of how that fits into the overall M&F guidance for the year. So given that, that the quarter as you just mentioned was mainly rates versus occupancy, and that's kind of the outlook for the second half of the year, and given that Asia was strong where there is most likely no owner's priority, curious why M&Fs were flat in the second quarter and then second part of that, should we expect for this line item to kind of re-accelerate above base and franchise fees as we have seen it in the past? Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think the short answer is yes, but let me give you a little bit more detail. First of all, remember for us that IMF is only 10% of the fee base, so not as big as you might find with other of our competitors which we like because IMF obviously by its very nature is a higher beta income stream. The reason you saw it flat in Q2 had to do with one-time stuff year-over-year. I think we would expect for the full year, it would be growing faster than base, certainly base and even core franchise fees. I think on an FX neutral basis, current expectation is for low teens, which is a little bit lower than where we've been, but that's because the bulk of that 10% IMF is in the international states and some of the places that have been more impacted by some of the things going on around the world. So, full year expectation, FX neutral, low teens, which is obviously \u2013 and they could have a higher growth rate than what you are seeing in the core fee base.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Research","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just broadly on supply, and obviously your pipeline growth looks pretty good here, but we're also seeing sort of similar growth from everyone else, and yesterday Starwood showed a pretty big spike. So my question is, how will this not result in an overall industry supply problem as we go forward? And what are you expecting for industry growth here in the U.S. for next year and into 2018?","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I mean, again, the prepared comments, which evidently not many people heard, but you can read. I think part of what's going on is, our development pipeline's picking up, but we are fighting way over our weight. Can't really speak to Starwood in any detail, but I'd say, relative to almost all the competition, with one notable exception, we are getting a disproportionate share of the development. We've got 25% of the rooms under construction are our brands in the United States, where we have 11% market share. So, part of what's going on is, the stronger brands are getting a disproportionate share of the development, which means you are in a nice place where you are not having a huge amount of supply, that's why you are still in the 1%s, but yet we can have really significant growth as a company, given the strength of these brands and the market share of these brands at the same time.","Expectations for next year, I think, if you look at consensus numbers, we are going to be this year, 1.7%, 1.8%. I think as you get into next year, its gets up to about 2%, 2.1% if I blend the consensus and obviously, we'd tick up above that. A 30-year average is 2.5%, and while you are going to be next year, starting in 2017 and 2018, you're going to get to and probably hit the longer-term average, my guess is, some people say 2017, I think the number's actually \u2013 traditionally come in lower than expectations. I think it's maybe late 2017, 2018.","I would note that, in no time in my experience have we had a \u2013 first of all, even when the supply has been two times and three times and four times those levels, has it been really supply that has driven the turn of a cycle, it's always really been demand, obviously supply being at high levels can accentuate that. But I don't think getting into the 2%s and low 2%s is, in and of itself, necessarily a problem. I've said this 1000 times probably, and I'd say it again, I think when people want to think about, when will the cycle turn? I think it is entirely going to be driven by the business cycle turn. So when you think the overall economy is going to go into a cyclical decline, I think that is what ultimately is going to drive a decline in the lodging cycle. I don't personally believe supply levels are going to get to a level, I mean, is it better for the number to be lower, of course, like the math, the laws of economics are alive and well, but high 1%s and low 2%s, I don't think are particularly problematic.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be from David Katz of Telsey Group. Please go ahead.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi, afternoon, all.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Afternoon.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I suppose everyone's apologized enough in both directions for repetition, so if I'm raising an issue you have discussed, let's put it in that bucket. But when I came in this morning and I read through your release, I then went back and read your transcript from the first quarter call. And it is quite a bit more bullish about the remainder of the year. And I suppose what I have not really captured so far is what changed, and clearly it's closer in business or expectations of such, but if you could just talk about what has shifted since that April 27 call, I'd appreciate it.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I'd be happy too, David, and I think it's three very straightforward things. One, what we've delivered year-to-date. We're now more than half done with the year, we've reported second quarter but we have very good visibility now into July, and decent visibility into August. So in April, we didn't have all that visibility. We've delivered 2.5% year-to-date.","We had hoped, and if you read that transcript you would find, we had seen some, I'd say threads of improvement. I think I may have used those words with the business transient segment. When we pulled those threads, they didn't lead to rope, meaning we haven't really seen a meaningful uptick, which I've talked about a bunch of times. So we had hoped we'd start to see a little bit more of an uptick sooner. I ultimately think it has to come, if the economy is strengthening, but we haven't seen it yet and we have a lot of the year now behind us.","And then, a bunch of things in the world have gone on since then, Brexit, coups in Turkey, the strengthening of the Japanese yen, terrorist events in multiple locations around the world, all of which, net-net, are not the end of the world necessarily, but they're all sort of a net drag. And when you put sort of the corporate transient not picking up year-to-date and things going on around the world together, it's how you get to the outlook that we've described.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","All right. Thank you. And if I can just sort of follow that up particularly around that last point, because we discussed the notion of sort of geopolitical issues and so forth. Does it appear that any one of these events has had more of an impact than any of the others, or is it, I'm sure there is an appropriate metaphor that we can come up with each one adds just a little bit more drag on the system.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say the latter.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Right. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Yes.","Operator","And the next question will come from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hello, everyone. Wanted to look at the corporate travel, the one thing that stands out, as you look at the demand for these upscale hotels, it's up almost 500 basis points year-to-date. Are they less exposed to the corporate travel customer? Are they pulling share from the full service hotels? What are your thoughts on why demand has been so strong for that category other than the fact that they had increased...","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's simply in a somewhat weaker environment more of a value proposition. And I probably wouldn't complicate it beyond that.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then by geography are you noticing any regions that are having at least decent corporate travel, I imagine the Texas area may have a little bit weakness due to the energy segment exposure and maybe Northeast from the financial services...","Christopher J. Nassetta - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I'd say the one, I mean probably the bright spots, the West Coast and the much less bright spot would be the oil patch, sort of energy patch. But otherwise, not notable exceptions.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Christian Charnaux, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Charnaux.","Christian Charnaux","Thank you, Sally. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide first quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today.","We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.

You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures discussed in today\u2019s call in our press release and SEC filings which have been provided on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com.","This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our first results and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report a great start to the year with strong first quarter results driven by topline RevPAR growth near the high-end of our guidance and strong fee growth and ownership segment performance, all of that resulted in adjusted EBIT -- EBITDA exceeding our guidance.","We continue to feel great about the fundamentals in our set up going forward in rate and have raised our guidance for the full year. We grew system-wide comp RevPAR of 6.6% on a currency neutral basis in the quarter, exceeding comparable RevPAR growth in Q1 2014 by 1.2 percentage points. With the added impact of weather in the quarter of about 0.5 point worse than last year, underlying RevPAR performance this quarter was clearly stronger year-over-year.","Rate growth accounted for little more than half of system-wide RevPAR growth, while occupancy continues to show strength up 210 basis points to 71% in the first quarter. Positive demand trends in both the group and transient segments along with revenue management strategy targeting shoulder periods should continue to drive ongoing occupancy growth.","System-wide group revenue -- group room revenue rose 6.8% in the first quarter, supported by strong demand especially from small rooms and company meetings, performance was modestly ahead of system-wide transient growth of 6.3%, which benefited from strong U.S. corporate negotiated and rack rated business, increasing by 9% and nearly 10%, respectively.","In Group, we are seeing strong growth at the top end of the demand funnel with perspective Group business up significantly in the quarter year-over-year. We expect Group business strength will continue, particularly in the seasonally stronger second quarter, which is also showing solid growth. Group position continued to track up in the mid-single digits for the full year.","F&B revenue at system-wide owned and managed hotels grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter, great banquet and catering business, especially in the Americas and Europe coupled with robust outlet performance, particularly in Japan drove the majority of the gains.","As discussed last quarter, we are extremely pleased with the successful execution of the Waldorf Astoria New York sale and 1031 exchange. To complete the exchange, we plan to deploy the last portion of the Waldorf sale proceeds to acquire what is currently the Cypress Hotel in Cupertino, California for $112 million. We expect to close on the transaction sometime in the second quarter.","To recap, we sold the Waldorf at a multiple of 32 times adjusted EBITDA, retained 100-year management contract, obtained a commitment from the buyer to renovate the property and use the net proceeds to acquire high-quality assets and some of the fastest-growing and highest barrier to entry domestic market at an aggregate multiple of just over 13 times adjusted EBITDA, more than doubling the adjusted EBITDA contribution to the company.","Also in the real estate area this morning, we announced the sale of the Hilton Sydney, capitalizing on favorable market conditions to sell asset at attractive pricing in a tax efficient manner.","The 442 million Aussie dollar sale price represents approximately 15 times adjusted EBITDA multiple and its subject to a 50-year management agreement. Upon closing, we expect to use the proceeds of the sale, net of transaction costs to further deleverage the company through an incremental debt prepayment.","On the development front we continue to see tremendous momentum. During the first quarter we opened 53 hotels with more than 8,000 rooms. We approved more than 23,000 rooms globally, totaling our highest number of deals in the quarter this cycle. Our 240,000 room pipeline is the largest in the business, according to Smith Travel and including all approved deals our pipeline stands at nearly 255,000 rooms.","According to Smith Travel, we also maintain the largest share of rooms under construction globally, with nearly 20% -- with nearly a 20% share, representing more than 126,000 rooms.","We are thrilled with the continued success of our newest brands, Curio a collection by Hilton has been a homerun for us with nearly 40 properties and 11,000 rooms open or in various stages of development.","We continue expanding into new urban and resort markets, and we are very excited by the brands international debut with several deals across Europe, including Istanbul, Hamburg, and the historic Astor Hotel in Paris.","We also signed agreements to add two Curio properties in Jamaica, which are slated to join the collection later this year and will mark the brands debut in the Caribbean. We also continue to see tremendous interest from owners in Canopy, our accessible lifestyle brand. Canopy has a total of 15 hotels either in the pipeline or with signed letters of intent.","Curio and Canopy are off to a great start and we continue to have great success in growing all of the brands in our portfolio. Recently our Hampton and flagship Hilton brands each passed the 200,000 room milestone with another combined 100,000 rooms in the pipeline.","DoubleTree by Hilton recently reached the 100,000 room milestone with another 40,000 rooms in the pipeline. Additionally, just last week, we announced the first Hilton Garden Inn will open in Hawaii early next year, bringing the powerhouse brand to all 50 states and increasing its distribution to nearly 100,000 rooms globally.","Now let me update you on our outlook around the world for the remainder of the year. Overall, the fundamentals of the cycle remained strong. In the U.S. where we generate nearly 80% of our adjusted EBITDA, we maintain our mid to high single-digit RevPAR growth forecast for the full year 2015, continuing demand growth driven by an improving economy, combined with historically low supply growth should continue to delivering solid fundamentals.","New York is the notable exception where strong demand is being tempered by supply growth many times greater than the U.S. average. For the Americas region outside the U.S., we anticipate mid single-digit RevPAr for the full year with positive momentum in Mexico, somewhat muted by weaker trends in Argentina and Brazil.","We maintained our mid single-digit RevPAR growth expectation for Europe, expecting mixed performance across the region, positive trends should continue throughout Germany, while Southern Europe should benefit from accelerating leisure demand. This will be tempered by anticipated economic and geopolitical challenges weighing on result in France and Eastern Europe, respectively.","For the Middle East, Africa region, we forecast mid single-digit RevPAR growth for the year, while improvements in Egypt appears sustainable, softening demand from Russia continues to be an overhang on fundamentals in the Arabian Peninsula.","In Asia-Pacific, we continue to expect high single-digit RevPAR supported by robust demand in Japan, recovery in Thailand and positive momentum in Shanghai and Beijing. The strength of these trends should more than offset modest weakness in Hong Kong and softening business transient demand in Singapore. We continue to forecast 6% to 8% RevPAR growth in China for the year, given our significant market share gains and market mix.","In closing we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and remained optimistic regarding fundamentals for the balance of the year and the foreseeable future. I believe that with our company\u2019s unique attributes we are in excellent position to continue outperforming in a very favorable environment.","With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you greater detail on our results and the outlook for the year rest of the year.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, our RevPAR growth of 6.6% was driven by 3.5% increase in average rate and a 2.1 percentage point increase in occupancy. In actual dollars system-wide RevPAR increased 4.6%.","Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.15, an increase of 25% versus the prior year period. After adjusting for special items EPS was $0.12, which was at the high end of our guidance.","We exceeded our guidance for adjusted EBITDA by approximately $25 million, driven by topline and fee growth, as well as ownership segment performance. We attribute roughly $15 million of the beat to favorable timing that will normalize over the balance of the year.","Management and franchise fees were $391 million in the quarter, up 18% over the first quarter of 2014, driven by strong topline growth, new unit growth and a rising effective franchise rate, which increased 10 basis points to 4.7% versus the year ago period.","Additionally, incentive fees rose 16% on a currency neutral basis in the quarter. For the full year, we expect incentive fee growth in the high-teens adjusting for currency and some one-time items.","The ownership segment outperformed our expectations in the quarter, with particular strength in Chicago, San Francisco and Orlando driving great topline growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $190 million, up approximately 9% versus the prior year, given better than expected group performance coupled with operating margin expansion of 130 basis points as lower cost boosted flow through.","Our timeshare adjusted EBITDA was $74 million in the quarter, a 10% decline versus the prior year period. Results met our expectations, given the accelerated timing of sales booked in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by higher fee for service sales and improved sales efficiency.","We continue to expect timeshare adjusted EBITDA of $335 million to $350 million for the full-year. We continue to make progress on transitioning our timeshare business to a capital light business with 78% of intervals sold during the quarter developed by third parties. We remain extremely pleased with the success of our fee for service deals, particularly the Grand Islander, which brought its four-month sales total to over $160 million, making it our best launch by a significant margin.","Our current supply of timeshare includes approximately 128,000 intervals, or over five years of inventory at the current sales pace, over 80% of which is capital light. We continue to expand our overall supply through capital light yields and are in discussions regarding several new capital efficient projects, which we expect to announce in the coming months. Finally, our corporate and other segment was $56 million for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations.","Moving on to regional results, strong performance across the globe contributed to our success this quarter. U.S. RevPAR grew 6.5% versus the prior year period, driven by strong group businesses in our owned hotels and gateway cities, particularly Chicago and San Francisco. Overall performance was somewhat tempered, however, by severe weather which we estimate negatively affected RevPAR growth by 50 basis points in January and 300 basis points in February. Overall for the quarter, weather negatively affected U.S. RevPAR growth by about a point.","In the Americas outside the U.S., RevPAR grew 6.7% for the quarter as strong results in Mexico more than offset challenges in Buenos Aires and S\u00e3o Paulo. In Europe, RevPAR increased 5.5% despite the first quarter being seasonally slow for the region.","Performance benefited from strong citywide business across Germany in group business in markets like Prague, Copenhagen and throughout Ireland. These positive trends offset weakness in France. London had a difficult start to the year as well with lower in group -- lower-than-expected group business and soft transient demand.","The Middle East and Africa region posted RevPAR gains of 5.4% for the quarter, driven primarily by double-digit growth in group business. Gains were predominantly owing to great convention calendars in Dubai, Doha, and Mecca. Additionally, the region continues to get a boost from improvements in Egypt which are offsetting softness in the Arabian Peninsula as that area struggles with a reduction in Russian demand.","Finally, in our Asia Pacific region, RevPAR improved 10% year-over-year, driven by double-digit occupancy increases in Japan and Thailand and a RevPAR gain of 12% in China. We attribute outperformance in China to our exposure to faster growing markets, newer hotels ramping up and strong market share gains.","Turning to our balance sheet, as of March 31st, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $816 million, of which $216 million is restricted. During the quarter, we reduced long-term debt by $225 million, including $150 million voluntary prepayment on our term loan and $75 million in debt reduction from the Waldorf sale and 1031 exchange.","We ended the quarter at 3.9 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and we prepaid an additional $100 million on our term loan this month, bringing total debt reduction year-to-date to $325 million. After completing the Hilton Sydney sale, we expect to prepay approximately $325 million of our term loan with the net proceeds and for the full year cash available for debt prepayments or capital return to stockholders should range from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.","Given our progress year-to-date, we remain well on our way to achieving our target leverage goals during the second half of the year. At that point, we intend to begin returning capital to stockholders, starting with the introduction of a dividend. We intend to outline more specifics during our second quarter earnings call.","Turning to guidance, as Chris mentioned, we had a strong start to the year, feel great about the fundamentals and as a result, have increased our full-year outlook. Our systemwide RevPAR guidance is between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We maintain ownership segment 2015 RevPAR growth guidance of 4% to 6% on a currency neutral basis.","We forecasted adjusted EBITDA to range from $2.81 billion to $2.87 billion for 2015, an increase of $10 million at the midpoint. The announced Hilton Sydney sale would reduce this range by $10 million to $14 million on closing.","As a reminder, our initial 2015 guidance had already assumed EBITDA contribution from the full deployment of proceeds from the Waldorf sale and 1031 exchange. We expect diluted EPS, adjusted for special items to be between $0.79 and $0.83 for the full year.","We expect management and franchise fee growth of 11% to 13% and are maintaining our net unit growth forecast of 40,000 to 45,000 rooms, representing 6% to 7% room growth in our management and franchise segment for the year. We expect the corporate and other segment to be roughly flat for 2015.","CapEx spending excluding timeshare inventory is forecast to remain approximately $350 million to $400 million, including about $265 million to $285 million in hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect systemwide RevPAR to increase between 5% and 7% on a currency neutral basis, driving management and franchise fee growth of 11% to 13%.","We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $740 million and $760 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.21 to $0.23. Further detail on our first quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sally, could we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Bill Crow","Good morning, guys. Nice start to 2015.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Bill.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks.","Bill Crow","Chris, as of 6:59 this morning, I wanted to ask your opinion of something that occurred on the Pebblebrook call when Jon Bortz last week suggested that RevPAR growth could accelerate in the U.S. next year relative to 2015 levels. But now as of 7 o\u2019clock and with one of your peer's announcements, I've got to ask you about M&A and your thoughts about sector M&A, Hilton's potential appetite for participating in M&A, just kind of a broad, open-ended question here. Let me hear your thoughts on that?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. Based on what I read in the press this morning, I figured somebody would ask me. Bill, thank you for being the one to do it and being first. For obvious reasons, I\u2019m not going to come on anything specifically that we might or might not be doing. But in terms of broader thoughts on industry consolidation and our participation and I\u2019m happy to talk about it. And I think you will find it is very consistent with everything I\u2019ve said a thousand times over the last couple of years.","In terms of broader industry consolidation, I think when you get to this stage of the cycle, you typically see more of it generally. And so I've every expectation that over the next 12, 24 months, you\u2019re going to see more of it. And it will follow a typical pattern exactly who does what is impossible to know. We all have views. I have views of who could do, could do -- be part of consolidating on and on what side but time will tell.","But I do think, you'll see an uptick and what exactly our competitor that made that announcement this morning does is really hard to know. I thought it was interesting, honestly, not particularly surprising when I read it. In terms of how we might participate in it, I think again consistent with what I\u2019ve said, the way I look at the world is we\u2019re in a really good place. You could see our first quarter results are really good in every regard. In my opinion, topline margins, bottom line, new unit growth, our expectations for the year are quite strong. We had a great year last year.","We think we have everything we need to lead the industry in our regards, topline, bottomline and unit growth. And I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of proving that in terms of the results that we\u2019re delivering since we\u2019ve been public. And our objective obviously is to continue to do it and I think we will. I think we have amazing opportunities with the brands that we have in our portfolio today and the opportunities we have to add to that portfolio brands to drive industry-leading organic net unit growth, which in my opinion is the best way to drive the highest value for all of our shareholders going forward.","Having said that and consistent with everything I've ever said as a CEO, it would be silly to say we would never participate in M&A activity because you never know what opportunities might present themselves that could make a tremendous amount of sense. And so I think we always want to remain open-minded. We think we have everything we need to deliver -- to continue to deliver industry-leading results. But if there are opportunities over time that presented themselves that made it through the following two filters, we would have to be thoughtful about it and those two filters are the obvious ones. One, that whatever it is, is a thoughtful strategic fit in terms of, the meshing of whatever it might be with what we have and that the economic drivers are such that you could see significant value accretion as a result of whatever it might be.","And so if there are things that present themselves that they get to those big filters then obviously we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about it. There is a lot of complexity to any of those things that might happen over time but we would be thoughtful. But our primary job was I think were proving out is to grind it out and really drive industry-leading results with what we have. And I think we have a -- we have an amazing set up between the scale of what we have, the breadth and diversity of our geography, the breadth and diversity of our brands in terms of chain scale that give us a really unique advantage to be able to continue to grow at an accelerating pace.","Bill Crow","That's very helpful, Chris. Would you care to opine on the prospect or potential of a reversal in the second derivate of RevPAR growth in the U.S. industrywide because of better group bookings and better performance at a couple of big markets that are laggards this year. Is that something\u2026?","Chris Nassetta","I said it in my prepared comments and we are being thoughtful about making sure we give time for other questions. I think we feel good about what\u2019s going on in RevPAR growth. I think the best way to look at RevPAR growth is quarter-to-quarter or one year versus the next, verses last quarter because every quarter as you know in our business cycles through different group patterns and other things. When I look at it, I made the comment in my prepared comments for a reason because I\u2019m trying to make the point that what we're seeing is acceleration. On a comp basis, our first quarter this year picked up over our first quarter of last year, not insignificantly, particularly when factoring for somewhat worse weather patterns in \u201915 and \u201914.","So, all I\u2019m going to say is from a cycle point of view, I think the fundamentals are as good as I've ever seen them. I know that everybody wants to debate it and I think that's fair because that is a really important point to understand. But from where I sit, having being doing this for 30 years in lots and lots of cycle, it's hard not to feel exceptionally good about what's going on in the sense that transient business is good and continues to stay good, if not get a little bit better.","Group is rebounding exactly the way that we would think with the ancillary spend coming along with it, the patterns looking forward, feel very good. And supply is still at historically low levels and everything that you see going into the next two or three years suggests it\u2019s going to be significantly below 30-year averages. So, I'm going to just say, we feel really good about where we are in the cycle. We feel really good about RevPAR growth and where it is and where it is going.","Bill Crow","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Shaun Kelley","Hey. Good morning everyone.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning, Shaun.","Shaun Kelley","Maybe just to stick with what is undoubtedly going to be the theme of the day. On M&A, Chris, could you just give us maybe a little bit more detail on kind of the opportunities in your own portfolio? Obviously, you're doing a ton on organic growth and particularly internationally as it relates to, I think, different brand profiles. So the question is, is there any area and particularly when we look at Hilton, I think we always kind of come back to the luxury component of the chain scale. Is there any area that you think you really could benefit from materially in terms of distribution power when you think about M&A? And how would you answer that or think about that?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. I would answer it probably the same way I already answered it when Bill asked it. But let me add a little bit, kidding aside. Let me add a little bit more color. As I look at our opportunity for organic growth, I think it is a combination of layering our existing brands intelligently around the world. This is one of the benefits of having the chain scale diversity that we do, is that if we are really intelligent and I have said this many times that we can lean in and lean out around the world as market conditions change around the world and allow ourselves to grow following the demand patterns in the various regions of the world.","So what we are doing in China, I think is a wonderful example. What we are doing in Europe is wonderful example of that. What we are doing in U.S. is a wonderful example of that, where you think about it. All of those are somewhat different stories. We have the chain scale diversity. We've been thoughtful about how we adapt our products and the service delivery for the particular regions and it\u2019s allowed us to grow even when some of our competitors are not or they are growing at a much slower pace. And I think our objective and strategy is to continue to do that. So anticipating what might happen in China as we've done with the limited service business, same thing in Europe and we will continue to do that.","So it is always from an organic growth point of view, in terms of numbers of rooms and hotels, the most significant opportunity is taking what we already have and deploying it really strategically and intelligently around the world. And we think that is a massive opportunity for growth. In addition, there are opportunities to -- we added two brands last year, which I talked about in my comments. We have some other opportunities and I have talked about those probably. I think, particularly an entry-level brand that would replace what space Hampton with all of its amazing success has exited as it\u2019s moved up. And I think we could stand to have a slightly lower price point brand in the mid-scale segment and price point, that would allow us to capture customers earlier in their lifecycle and garner their loyalty to allow them to grow up and grow up with us in our system and shop in and around our system with our other brands. So, we are very hard at work, whether it\u2019s this year or early next, sometime I\u2019d say in the next 12 months. For sure, you are going to see us do something in that category. And we think that could be a mass scale brand globally. I mean, it will start likely in the U.S. But given the scale of the Hampton brand as an example, we have 2,000 hotels, over 2,000 hotels open. This could be amongst the largest brands by hotel count that we have. And I think we will be a very powerful driver of bringing new customers in and continuing to build loyalty.","On luxury, specifically, I think we have made amazing progress from where we were six or seven years ago with Waldorf and Conrad. We have tremendous momentum going from a system that at that time was 20 hotels. So what\u2019s opening the pipeline today is 80-ish hotels with some of the best hotels that are opening in the fastest-growing luxury brands in the world. I think we have great momentum in that space. And I think organically, we can accomplish our objectives in luxury space in addition to every other segment, I think that is represented in the industry. So, I feel like as I said sort of answering those questions, we have what we need to be successful. I do not -- I will be very clear. I do not think we have a strategic gap that we cannot deal with ourselves, okay. I don't feel like -- there's nothing we can\u2019t accomplish organically.","So there are others out there that we compete with, that might not be in that same position. But I think we have everything it takes to be successful. So, I will stop. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are perfect. Okay. That doesn't mean that there aren\u2019t things that we could do in luxury or frankly in any of our segments that can make us stronger and better. And I go back to what I said before. Whether it's luxury, whether it upscale, mid-scale, upper upscale scale, whatever we would do, whatever brand or whatever portfolio brands that might be out there and play, we are going to at it through the lens as I described. Does it fit strategically and make us better than where we are? Does it allow us to ultimately accelerate our growth over time?","And ultimately as a result of that and other factors, could we create significant value? Because we all know, whatever it is big or small, there are always risks in doing things that are inorganic versus organic. So those are the filters that we would look through and I know everybody is looking for more [indiscernible], I\u2019d say, we are in a nice position where we don't have to do anything. I think we can be very, very successful and create a huge amount of value doing this, doing what we do organically. But we always are going to be thoughtful about broader opportunities.","Shaun Kelley","Thanks for beating the dead horse for me. I appreciate it.","Chris Nassetta","You are welcome. I suspect that may not be the last time I beat the horse, so I will get my whip out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Carlo Santarelli","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, you've always been pretty forthright with your view of the cycle and maybe the cadence of the cycle, more specifically as it pertains to an elongated, stable mid single-digit RevPAR growth. When you think about in the context of your peers and thinking about it along the lines of clearly differing views of the cycle sometimes lead to a little bit more activity in the space. As you speak to some of your peers to the extent that you do, are you starting to hear more differentiated opinions as to where we are or how this cycle will proceed from here?","Chris Nassetta","That\u2019s an interesting question. I mean, you could probably answer it better than I could in the sense that while I talk to my peers, my guess is you are talking more directly about this topic than I am to my peers. But Carlo, interesting and good question. I\u2019d say so no. I do not -- I can't think of a conversation, I mean, they always decrease but I'd say that there is not really anybody that I'm talking to that\u2019s in the industry that is viewing the cycle a whole heck of a lot differently than what I described. I know that I\u2019ve kidded people about this. Everybody wants to do it, particularly when it\u2019s baseball season and what inning are you in and people might have different views within an inning that I've sort of gotten out of the business of talking about what inning we are in because I don't think it matters.","I think what matters is what's in front of us, not what's behind us. And I in my prior response gave my views of that, which is I think what's in front of us is for as long as I think you could sort of try and be intelligent about it, which is the next two or three years, I think you\u2019ve got an amazing set up. There are certainly things that could disrupt it. There are things that happened in the world that could cause reductions and demand and the like.","But I\u2019m saying all things being equal in the environment we are in from a macro point of view matched with what's going on the supply side. It is really hard for me and I think others that certainly I'm talking to, to have a view that\u2019s different than that. I mean, they are just -- it is hard as I look. There is nothing in our business. There's no pattern. There is no metric. There's nothing that suggest there's a problem. That's very rare. I've heard those words come out of my mouth. I think I've been a real straight shooter for the time I\u2019ve been in the industry. But it is good and until something really major changes, which I don't see on the horizons for what I can see, it\u2019s going to stay good.","Carlo Santarelli","That\u2019s very helpful. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up. I believe on the last call you guys had referenced management franchise RevPAR growth 5% to 7%, less 100 basis points for FX. Has that assumption changed at all? I assume based on the guidance, there is a little bit more built in for FX, but could you clarify from the RevPAR perspective?","Chris Nassetta","I will have Kevin to do that.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Carl, I think we still give the same range. I mean, I think if you do the math, it's a little bit worse because the outlook is getting a little bit worse, but I would still probably give the same range plus or minus for the differential.","Carlo Santarelli","Kevin, just to clarify, the outlook you're referring to the FX outlook, correct?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes.","Carlo Santarelli","Okay. Thanks, guys. Thank you very much.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Steven Kent","Hi, good morning.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Kent","Good morning. Can you talk about the competition for newly launched brands, Curio, Canopy, following similar brand launches from Hyatt, Starwood Marriott, etcetera. Are you finding that you need key money debt financing or more attractive terms to get people to sign with Curio?","And then as a follow-on, and I am not sure if these two are linked. We noted that conversions were 40% of room additions in first quarter of 2015. How does that compare to history? What are franchisees typically converting from? And are they converting to some of these softer brands, Curio in particular?","Chris Nassetta","All right. There is a lot in that. So I'd say in short form, obviously there are competitive brands being launched. You guys are aware of them, reading about them. And thus, the question, I gave some of the stats in my prepared comments. It\u2019s a competitive world, but I'd say we are faring very well.","If you look at what's going on with Curio, five open, 11 in the pipeline, 23 under letter of intent, we have over 11,000 rooms already sort of teed up and ready to go. And I'm not saying that we don't have some competition occasionally, but we don't have I would say really stiff competition on the specific deals that we\u2019re working on. We are not seeing any sort of pattern of having to buy the business in the form of key money or other things.","And I think, Steve, I mean, it\u2019 self-serving to say, but it happens to be in my humble opinion true. We have a unique competitive advantage. We have the Hyatt\u2019s average market share in our -- of any of the players with our system producing an average market share of over 115%. If you look at Curio, you look at any new brand launch, what owners are trying to do is make a decision to put their money with whoever they think is going to drive the best economic result with the highest average market share and with the great scale and diversification geographically and chain skills that creates this loyalty effect which I talked a lot about, which is what\u2019s helping drive that market share.","I think owners are looking at that saying I want to be part of that because it\u2019s going to help me drive more revenue and profitability into my hotel. So I think you can play with key money, you can invest. But when you have that advantage which we are not just planning to maintain but enhance in terms of growing market share, it gives you a unique competitive advantage in my opinion. Thus, I think the success that we are seeing in Curio and Canopy and I can assure you with the new brand that I mentioned that we are working on launching, we have tons and tons of interest from our existing particularly because that will be almost entirely a franchise brand from your existing franchise ownership community.","For the very same reasons these are the same people that have built tons and tons of Hampton Inns that has an average market share of a 124%, 125% and they know we have the skills to replicate that in a system to drive the results. So I think there is something different about us in my humble opinion, which is the system is unbelievably powerful which allows us to get these brands up and running faster and deliver better commercial results for owners get better economic turns for us and do it with little or no capital. Okay. That\u2019s our story. That\u2019s our strategy. It\u2019s as simple as that.","In terms of conversions, we have great conversion activity in the first quarter, probably little higher than the full year. If you look at the last, I would say three years on average, it\u2019s been about a third of our growth bounces up and down a little bit. It\u2019s a little bit higher than that in the first quarter. I think for the full year it\u2019s probably about a third. That\u2019s what we see and it will, if you look at where it\u2019s coming from, I mean the brands, it\u2019s largely DoubleTree and Curio. That\u2019s where we will see the conversion activity.","Curio obviously was part of that strategy. DoubleTree, many years ago, six years ago as we rein -- sort of reenvision DoubleTree and transform that it was all about being a great conversion brand and we\u2019ve had amazing success, far more conversions and far more rooms converted than any other of our competitors. And it\u2019s coming from a host of places. If we look at DoubleTree, it\u2019s coming from some of our competitor brands, a little bit of independent. If you look at Curio, a little bit of competitor brands but largely coming from independent hotels.","Steven Kent","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis","Good morning, guys. I think the horse has just a little bit more life in it.","Chris Nassetta","Oh, my god, really, okay.","Harry Curtis","No, it\u2019s still\u2026","Chris Nassetta","Let me get -- I will get the whip out.","Harry Curtis","It\u2019s still switching. Two quick questions. First of all, do you think it's reasonable to believe that you've looked at most potential combinations, not just in the last six months, but over the last four years?","And then the second question, and this is one that might be more politically different -- difficult to answer, but is it necessarily the case that Blackstone can do something separate from Hilton if they wish?","Chris Nassetta","On the first one, I am not going to comment and what we\u2019ve looked at and what we haven\u2019t looked at. I mean I think the broader thing Harry ,you can assume that we are living, breathing, sensing human beings that sort of are aware what\u2019s going on in the market. And as a result, if nothing else, our intellectual curiosity takes us all over the place. So yes, we have been doing this long time.","We are always noodling everything as we would hope we would. It doesn\u2019t mean we do everything obviously. We are very thoughtful on that. But we are always sort of noodling about everything.","In terms of BX, I think you need to ask BX. BX is a separate entity. They happen to own at the moment the majority of the company. But what they do with their independent separate funds that are is really their business.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Let me then, in my second question, move on to fundamental one. As you speak with your corporate customers, what are they indicating about their hotel needs over the next 12 months, given the relatively flat corporate profits in the first quarter? Is there any indication that they are likely to cut their travel budgets over the next 12 months?","Chris Nassetta","Really good question and interesting. And I think the answer is both sort of broadly talking are sales teams but also more specifically because I am constantly talking to some of our larger customers in various settings. I don\u2019t know, not only do I not get a sense of them cutting back, I get a sense of them increasing volumes and being more willing to pay higher rates and knowing in a sense that they have to pay higher rates given what\u2019s going on both in the broader economy as well as in the industry.","Harry Curtis","That\u2019s perfect. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Chris Nassetta","You bet.","Vince Ciepiel","Wanted to focus a little bit on the stronger U.S. dollar and the potential impact on international stays, have you guys seen anything year-to-date? And are you seeing anything kind of impact bookings for this summer?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. Another great question. It\u2019s interesting when we look at all the data, intellectually given the strength of the dollar you have to believe that it\u2019s impacting business at least somewhat. As we in the beginning of the year talked to our GMs in the big markets, they were not really indicating any material shift other than maybe in New York where you have a little bit heavier component where I think they were filling it a little bit.","So anecdotally, I would say people didn\u2019t think there is much. When you get the hard data at the end of the quarter which we now have, actually ironically international business was up in the quarter by a little less -- by better half a point. So not meaningfully but it was up.","So what\u2019s really been going on, New York down, but across the U.S. recognizing for background that it\u2019s only 5% of our business across the U.S. to begin with, but that the world is a big place, I don\u2019t have to tell you and there places where it\u2019s more impacted than other places.","So what we saw in the first quarter and I expect to continue is that business out of Europe, a little out of Canada, but mostly out of Europe was declining particularly at a Germany and France. Ironically don\u2019t know exactly why to be honest, Spain was up. But what was up in a meaningful way was China, because a number of us that worked really hard in the industry to work with the U.S. government and the Chinese government to make it easier and more efficient to get visas and that is having a dramatic positive impact on what has been the largest outbound customer base, which is now China in the world. So those are sort of offsetting.","I think as we get into the summer months, I think you get another dynamic which is I do believe with the strengthening dollar, you will continue to see some impact of European business coming in U.S., meaning it will be weaker. I think China business is going to continue to be strong. I think U.S. business in the US for the drive-through market given cheap gas prices is going to be better.","And I think Europe is a bit on sale not an insignificant 9% or 10% of our business, I do believe and we are starting to see the early patterns of summer bookings. They are reflective of the fact that a lot of people are going to go to the Europe that might not have otherwise gone and that\u2019s going to give us a boost there. The net result of all that is we are not -- we did not change our view on RevPAR growth and the simple reason is we don\u2019t we think that with all the puts and takes they sort of flush out.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Thanks. And then currency has moved against you guys a bit since the 4Q call. I think last time you noted on the $40 million full year headwind, of which about $25 million hits the fee business. Any updated thoughts there?","And then I guess when you think about the EBITDA raise despite the FX, is it fair to say you're feeling a bit better about core fee growth out of that change?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Vince, it\u2019s Kevin. That\u2019s exactly the way to think about it so far. If our fee was $25 million and we set about $15 million of it, it was timing so we had $10 million beat in the first quarter and we raised $10 million for the year. We\u2019ve got about $15 million to $20 million of incremental FX for the year, so it\u2019s really a $25 to $30 million FX adjusted raise at the mid-point.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Thanks for the explanation.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thanks for taking the question.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks.","Felicia Hendrix","Kevin, I thought you -- maybe thought you were going to get off the hook on this call, but you're not. So, look, this is, obviously, the closest you guys are discussing a dividend. You said you're going to give us more color on the second quarter, just wondering that that even...","Kevin Jacobs","I did.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes. You did. Its going to be a second quarter announcement, are you going to discuss it further than? And then just wanted to know in light of that if you could discuss, your commitments in investment grade rating and timing on that?","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Felicia. Yeah. We did say, we\u2019ll give you, we\u2019ll -- I think what we\u2019ll do is outline a plan on the second quarter call. We\u2019ve got to spend a little bit of time talking to our Board about what we want our strategy to be and looking at our forecast and obviously, ultimately, they\u2019re the ones that will decide, but we will intend to be able the outline the plan on the second quarter call.","The Sydney transaction incrementally helps get us a little bit closer and we've been saying, I think, for awhile now that we thought we'd be in the zone in the back half of year.","We have not wavered on our commitment to investment grade. We think that the range that we've outlined would get us consistent with our peers. Our peers\u2019 investment grade companies we will be balanced about it and work with the agency, so we've not wavered on that commitment.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. And then just also follow-up for you, Kevin. You mentioned in your prepared remarks increase in your effective franchise rate in the quarter.","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah.","Felicia Hendrix","I was just wondering how much those rates can move up over the next few years and how much that could add in fees?","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah. I think, they ought to move up consistently with the way they have been. So it's been kind of around to 10 basis points for the quarter. It\u2019s gone from four-flat to four-seven over the course of the last five years or so. And we would think that we could consistently, not only continue to get closer to our published rate, which is 5, 4.55 but if we do our jobs right and continue to grow -- strengthen the brands, we ought to be able to increase our published rates overtime. And so I think you'll continue to see it grow at the same -- at a similar pace.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. Thank you.","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah. Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird. Your line is open.","David Loeb","Don\u2019t worry, Chris. I'm not going there.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you. I\u2019ve nothing more I can say on it, but I can try in other way to say. Go ahead. Sorry, David.","David Loeb","It\u2019s okay. I just at the risk of asking what have you done for me lately question. You've made a lot of progress on asset monetization this year, clearly. But can you talk a little bit about what you're looking at in the future for additional monetization opportunities?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. I -- we've been, I think, pretty consistent. I know very consistent on the point, which we had an opportunity in the Waldorf. We said that we may have others. Obviously, Sydney is one of those others. They maybe other asset sales I would say, that would be quite modest that we could pursue nothing around that corner.","The bulk of the remaining real estate, certainly from of value point of view, David, really because of the tax attributes if and when we wanted to do something would really need to be done more on a structured transaction then kind of an asset monetization of the type we've been doing.","David Loeb","Okay. And then just to follow that, on the Cypress, what's the brand planning for that? What's your expectation -- what brand that hotel will become?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. Ultimately it will become a Curio. Okay, we think is the appropriate branding.","David Loeb","Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Joseph Greff","Good morning all.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Greff","Can you share with us your outlook for the New York City market for the balance of the year and if you think it's still a negative RevPAR growth market?","Chris Nassetta","You know, I don't. For the first quarter was obviously negative for us. The market was down in the 6s. Now that\u2019s probably exacerbated by a lot of work going on at our largest hotel. We had a big renovation of rooms plus the retail space going on at the New York Hilton. So its comp, but -- its driving part of it, but it was down in the first quarter, as I think most sort of the industry stats are.","For the full year, Joe, we think it's actually going to flip around. We don't think it's going to be leading the charge in terms of growth in U.S. But we\u2019re in the low to mid-single digits, 3% to 5% growth is what we would forecast for the New York market overall.","Early reads on April sort of feel pretty good, feels like after the first quarter with weather, with Super Bowl overlap with renovation disruption that we had all of those things sort of hurt the first quarter.","When we\u2019re get into April we look at the booking pace for May and June, supports what I'm saying. So, I think, we push really hard and dug really deep into these forecast and we\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019re going to show positive growth for the market.","Joseph Greff","Great. Thank you. And then, in your earlier remarks, Chris, you had mentioned in the first quarter the Group growth outpaced the transient growth. Do you see that perform more in balance -- the balance of the year, how do you see that transpire?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. I think they're balancing around the similar plate. They're both -- they thing about the last couple quarters, I don't have the numbers all on my head, but I think, this year we think they\u2019re going to both be in the 6 to 7 range and one might be a little higher or lower, depending on the quarter, because as we all know Group sort of cycle differently in the quarters depending on the big groups in the big hotels.","But we feel like it\u2019s going to -- they\u2019re both going to be in that range, which is why I sort to say, I\u2019ve never felt -- I've never seen it feel better when you got sort of all the cylinders hitting at same time.","Joseph Greff","That's all for me. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Smedes Rose","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask you just about the mid-scale segment. Just a couple of questions, we continue to see pricing and those lower price points looks to be better gains year-over-year. And do you still kind of think that we'll see more convergence there? I think you had talked about that on the fourth quarter call, given the group trends that you're seeing.","And also, I know supply remains pretty low, but we are seeing kind of -- it seems like a pretty rapid pickup in the number of upper mid-scale hotels in the pipeline. And when you talk to developers, do you see like kind of a market difference in the ability to access financing or lower equity needs or kind of how -- what are you sort of seeing in that area?","Chris Nassetta","No. I think -- maybe I\u2019ll take the last first. I think the reason you're seeing the more of the development getting done there is that the economic model works there. I mean, so I think that the end market is sort of efficient. People are able to drive better results, higher margins and as a result can raise the capital to do it. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problematic data but I think it's -- I mean, you stated the fact. You're seeing the highest RevPAR growth in that segment and supply is higher in that segment, not crazy high but of the segment it\u2019s higher.","I think its cause and effect. I mean, it\u2019s just the economic model is driving that. We don't see that there is a mounting problem performance continues to be very good, even as supply is coming because it\u2019s just healthier. There's more demand and the money is following that demand.","In terms of convergence I do -- we saw a little bit of the convergence I talked about in the first quarter. If we look at the focused service versus everything else and we still think for the full year, both those broad categories are going to perform well. And we do think that they're going to continue to converge.","Smedes Rose","Thanks. Just on the Cypress Hotel that you're acquiring, does Hilton have to pay a termination fee to get out of that Kimpton contract, or is that something that the seller would pay?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. We -- as part of the deal we do, but it\u2019s a very modest term fee.","Smedes Rose","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Joel Simkins","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to touch on the timeshare real quickly. Obviously, your results continue to look very strong there. One of your big competitors, I would say, was a bit mixed yesterday. So kind of what's the secret to success there right now? Are you seeing anything different from the consumer in terms of willingness to buy more product to be a bit more aggressive with financing? And then just to follow up with that, I mean, how you can continue to think about timeshare, sort of, core to your business and the current platform?","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah. Joel, its Kevin. I\u2019ll take the first part and then maybe Chris will jump in on the second part. I think the consumer demand for the product remains strong. I think, we've seen -- well, our results have been -- in fact, our VPG for the quarter was up over 20%, now that\u2019s been partially driven by. We opened a really strong high-priced product at the Grand Islander in Hawaii, so that\u2019s driving VPG.","But for the full year, we still think it's going to be strong at 10 plus percent growth in VPG with high single-digit growth in tourist. So we continue to see high demand for the product but a lot of it's driven by great projects in strong markets and our ability to sell it well.","Chris Nassetta","On the second part of the question, it goes without saying, we\u2019re very happy with the result in timeshare that Kevin just described. We\u2019re very happy with the transformation in the progress we\u2019re making towards making it a very high percentage of capital light business. Our customers love it. The results are good. We\u2019re changing the return profile of the business to be much like the hotel business.","So it's good on all fronts but I will say, very simplistically as you would hope, we\u2019re always looking at ways to maximize the long-term value of the company. As part of that we\u2019re looking at all the options on all segments of the business, including timeshare and trying to be thoughtful about not withstanding how successful it is. Is there another format that we should be considering structurally that might create even greater value for the shareholder base. So we made some good progress and thinking about that both from a technical and structural point of view, not any conclusion by a long stretch. So if and when we get to a point where we have some judgments on that, we\u2019ll obviously get back with you and let you know. But we wanted to be very open-minded and we will always remain focused on maximizing value. And if there is different approach then, we are -- we would pursue it.","Joel Simkins","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Thomas Allen","Hi, good morning. So, two quick questions on China. First, last quarter you mentioned that F&B business looked like it was picking up a little bit. Now that you have the hard data for the first quarter, do you still feel confident in that?","And the second question, can -- is there any way to quantify or think through how the association you did with Plateno Group for Hampton could kind of help your greater portfolio just as we see a kind of increase in outbound travel outside of China? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah. The first one simple answer is, yes. We continue to see benefits of rebounding food and beverage. It\u2019s not skyrocketing, okay. But from a pattern, we\u2019re seeing significant declines quarter-over-quarter. Yes, we\u2019ve start to see stabilization and recovery and we think it\u2019s the beginning, hopefully of a good trend.","On Plateno, as we outline when we announced the deal that is one of the primary drivers for why we entered into the relationship with those guys, was that, but we saw is that the development opportunities in China were changing. They\u2019re going to up and down and be different over different periods of time.","But ultimately, the economics are going to drive not unlike what I described, is going on with upscale here in U.S. and China with rising labor costs, rising cost of construction. The thing, the type of product that is going to make -- I think more sense broadly throughout China and in on a mass basis is going to be at that price point.","And we looked at lots of ways to do it, in ourselves and with various partners. We picked Plateno because after a long process and a lot of work, we felt like given their success with 7 Days and their scale and their ability to drive the commercial side of the business, they were clearly far and away the best partner.","And it was obviously driven by us making money and adding rooms. And I think it is going -- I know it's going to do that. But it was also sort of part of the underlying thesis that I keep describing, which is this loyalty affect. It works. We know it works. It works where we end up with scale and price point diversity and geographic diversity. We need those same things in China.","The only way to get those things broadly in China and from a geographic point of view is that at this price point and we think they're the best partner to do that. We win in China and we create that loyalty effect. The 100 million going to 200 million travelers that are leaving China, we think are going to. We do our job, right, to be more loyal to us everywhere else in the world when they travel. So that is a very significant part of the underpinning for the strategy with Plateno.","Thomas Allen","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Rich Hightower","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Rich Hightower","So just one quick twist on the dead horse we've all been talking about. Sorry to ask another question on this. But as I think about the organic versus non-organic growth argument that you sort of laid out previously, given your existing platform and infrastructure at Hilton, what is the cost to build a ground-up brand internally versus going externally? And then maybe you can help answer that by telling us what you have spent to date on Curio and Canopy and what you sort of pencil the returns at for those initiatives?","Chris Nassetta","I can do it pretty easily. De minimis investment, infinite returns. How\u2019s that for a quick answer?","Rich Hightower","That\u2019s pretty quick.","Chris Nassetta","We invest there -- I mean it\u2019s mostly, honestly our time. I mean, I'm being a little cute in the sense that I'm not allocating the time to the people that are here. But it's mostly our -- given the size of our system and infrastructure that we have on a global basis and relationships we have with owners, et cetera. It is really for the size of our operation relatively de minimis okay.","It's not -- it\u2019s in the millions of dollars, not tens of million, which I view as pretty much immaterial for us. And the returns -- when I say infinite, maybe they are not quite infinite are exceptionally high because we invest very little and we build great platforms. So in Curio, it might be in the single of millions of dollars and we have 11,000 rooms open there in the pipeline.","So the math is unbelievably compelling, which is why when we look at other individual brand opportunities, I\u2019m not going to pick on any, but there have been a bunch that have being done recently over the last two or three or four years. We have looked at those. And in those cases said, we\u2019re better off doing it organically. We\u2019re going to drive better returns for our shareholders because it\u2019s not just a growth that they can give. It is incremental growth that they could give us over what we could do on our own because we could do it on our own without making any investment.","And when we\u2019ve looked at the returns on that basis, our returns and we\u2019re very disciplined about looking at -- when we invest capital, any kind of capital getting an adequate return, we really get returns on the basis, at least historically over the last few years. We\u2019ve not seen returns that justified taking action. That doesn't mean that there are not opportunities in front of us where that equation changes. But it gives you a sense that ","there is a really unique advantage when you get to be as big and when you have market -- the average market share that is this strong and 44 million honors members and you\u2019re everywhere in 100 countries around the world and all these price points with 10,000 developer relationships you got a lot of values. There is a lot of value in that and our job is always to say, all right, what are our competitive strengths and how do we optimize our competitive strengths to create value for all of us to shareholders.","Rich Hightower","All right. Great. Thanks, Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah.","Rich Hightower","And then one quick follow-up, I'm just wondering to the extent that you guys are familiar with Blackstone's thinking, why do you think we haven't seen any recent secondaries?","Chris Nassetta","That you would have to ask them. We know that they've started a process and they've done a couple of transactions. We know the business they are in is one that ultimately requires the recycling of capital. I do think that that is the pattern and that is the trajectory they\u2019re on. Exactly when they decided to do it, I can honestly tell you it\u2019s not my decision. And so I can\u2019t give you color other than to say, I do think that the pattern that they established last year will continue at some point.","Rich Hightower","Okay. That's all for me. Thanks, Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is you\u2019ve talked about getting to investment grade and potentially instituting a dividend sometime in the second half of the year. So, I guess I just wanted to get a sense of how much of a priority is that commitment to investment grade and returning capital versus, you talked about potentially at the right price, you might do something. You could do something if it worked strategically and all of those classifications that you added. Is being investment grade and paying a dividend something that would also be a filtering issue if you were going to do something?","Chris Nassetta","Let me address. I think I got the question. To be clear, Kevin stated it. We do want to become investment grade and we do think that range in debt to EBITDA that we\u2019ve outlined consistently of three to four times, probably in the middle-ish or little bit lower that is probably where it takes to get there.","We are very comfortable with the balance sheet with or without the investment grade status. And I want to be clear because we are not trying to be cute. We are -- we are prepared to institute a return of capital program starting with a dividend in the second half of the year subject to your Board making final decisions on that in advance of an investment grade status.","So we are not -- we are not saying that has to precede the beginning of a return of capital program. If it does, great. I suspect honestly it will not, and that my view is we\u2019ll be on a path to getting there and we can get there. And at the same time given the trajectory of the deleveraging, we can return capital as well.","Robin Farley","And similarly though it\u2019s too, if you did a potential transaction, you talked about all the reasons why you might or wouldn't have to. Is paying a dividend something that would be a priority for, that that's something you would want to be able to do, even if you did a transaction?","Chris Nassetta","Well, I think that would get -- it's all hypothetical, I mean I think we are in the business of creating value so that would -- any transaction, it would sort of be -- it would be one of many, many factors I think that would be involved it, certainly don't view it as a driver. But we are committed to returning capital.","So I do believe that it would be a consideration meaning anything that would stop us from returning capital would not be a positive because we are interested, I think the shareholder base is interested in our returning capital and we are as well.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. And then actually just an easy question on your guidance in Q1. Your management fee growth rate didn't move for the full year, even though Q1 was up 18%. Is that because of FX?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. So it\u2019s pretty much all FX.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning, guys.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Jeff Donnelly","Just wanted to come back to the cycle question. Just I am curious rather than asking where we\u2019re at, I\u2019m curious, Chris, what are the metrics you look at to conclude whether we\u2019re at the peak of the cycle or not, or is the edge only determinable once you\u2019ve crossed over it?","Chris Nassetta","It\u2019s hard to say. I mean one of that -- one of the things that gives me comfort that we are not at the peak are particularly close. If you look at any kind of historical perspective is what\u2019s going out with occupancy gains, I mean really in my personal experience when I go back and think about when you are getting to peaks of cycles, it\u2019s when you really are seasoning rate growth to a point where it -- in many cases over a 100% of your RevPAR growth and we are just nowhere near that right.","We are still getting very -- we are going to have lower occupancy gains this year I think system wise than last year. Last year we\u2019re 2.5 points in occupancy. This year we\u2019ll be less, but we are still going to be close to 2 points of occupancy. It\u2019s not the only metric, but I think it's a very healthy metric that your demand base is growing. At the same time, you are gaining pricing power. It\u2019s certainly to me one of the great indicators that there\u2019s a -- that you are in a very healthy part of the cycle.","Jeff Donnelly","And maybe just my angle on the Starwood question, maybe it's a two-parter, but are the goals of diluting down Blackstone's ownership and improving Hilton's balance sheet strategic enough to warrant consideration other than as a means to an end. And I guess maybe a follow-up is what concern do you have that their review leads to an existing competitor becoming a more formidable threat to you guys?","Chris Nassetta","I don\u2019t think Blackstone or balance sheet, if you don\u2019t do big M&A whatever it is, that\u2019s all the issues, I mean -- it\u2019s got to be strategically and economically driven, or you\u2019ll screw up something, you will screw up a good company taking any other perspective than that. Second question was -- second part was...","Jeff Donnelly","Just whether or not you thought it might be an opportunity for a competitor that makes them more venerable?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I mean, no, I mean, I can\u2019t. I don't lose. I don\u2019t wake up in the middle of night losing sleep over that and simply because what I\u2019ve described probably more than you guys want to hear today, I think we\u2019ve got a -- I don\u2019t want to say we are perfect and we have lots of things that I wake up every day and all night long worrying about that I want us to do better and we are working on and we will do better. But I like our setup, I like what we have, I like the momentum, I like the makeup of the company, I think it gives us lots of advantages.","And so I can see why others might want to do something to sort of feel -- look and feel more like that and that ultimately they might be a more worthy competitor. But I think what we got is really, really good. And if we execute which I will promise we will and we are disciplined about how we manage the business. We got tremendous potential.","So I can't -- I certainly don\u2019t do deals and I don't think you\u2019d ever want us to be doing deals defensively. I think we are great place. We do our job. We are going to stay in a great place. If we can incrementally add to that with whatever is out there, we should be thoughtful and consider those options and we should not do it in a defensive way ever.","Jeff Donnelly","Great. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","Good morning, everyone. A quick question on China. What is your expectation for ADR growth this year, and what is leading it? Would it be the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities outpacing the lower tier cities or vice versa?","Chris Nassetta","I think that Tier 1 cities, Shanghai and Beijing are going to have pretty good years particularly Beijing because it\u2019s had some tougher years so it\u2019s coming back. I think the blended growth is still pretty balanced between rate and occupancy for the full year.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Chris Nassetta","You bet.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Nassetta.","Chris Nassetta","Well, thank you, everybody. That was a good robust call. We are happy to have the time to catch up. Obviously very pleased with not just the first quarter but momentum that we have I think going into what\u2019s going to be another fantastic year for the industry and importantly, a fantastic year for Hilton Worldwide.","We appreciate the time, look forward to getting back together with you after Q2 where we can update you on our progress, update you with more specific plans on return of capital.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton's first quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.

Unless otherwise noted, comparisons to the company's first quarter 2016 results assume that the spin-off transaction had occurred on January 1, 2016. Please see our earnings release for additional details.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our first quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following our remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Thank you, Jill, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We're pleased to report our first quarter as the new simplified Hilton with the RevPAR growth, at the top end of our guidance range, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS results above expectations and with good progress on our recently announced share repurchase program.","As a result of the strong start to the year, we're also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year. We continue to see tremendous momentum in unit growth as our share of global hotel development continues to increase. We opened nearly 8,000 net rooms in the quarter and we remain on track to deliver approximately 6.5% net unit growth this year, while adding over a 100,000 new signed rooms to our development pipeline.","We expect 2017 to be another record year for construction starts, openings and net unit growth. Our top line performance continues to benefit from favorable fundamentals along with market share premiums driven by our industry-leading brands and commercial platform. System-wide RevPAR increased 3% in the quarter helped by the Easter calendar shift. Leisure and corporate transient both performed well and group RevPAR meaningfully outperformed our expectations.","Looking forward, macroeconomic forecasts are relatively unchanged since last quarter with U.S. GDP and non-residential fixed investment expected to outpace 2016 growth rates. Modestly accelerating demand should offset forecasted supply growth, allowing us to deliver a full-year system-wide RevPAR growth in the 1% to 3% range, driven by solid group and transient performance. Group position for the year remains positive with nearly 85% of the business on the books.","Turning to development, our pipeline increased 16% year-over-year to a record 2,100 hotels and 325,000 rooms. Hotel owners continue to invest in our growth at a record pace, accelerating our net unit growth. We continued to approach our growth in a strategic and discipline way with new units coming from existing brands in both new and current markets as well as organically-developed new brands targeted at incremental market segments. All brand segments are at record pipelines and the pipeline mix is similar to our installed base with balanced distribution across chain scales.","As our growth is almost entirely financed by third parties, we generate substantial returns on minimal capital investment. We also generate leading returns on our owners' investments, which enables us to continue growing franchise rates. Our effective rate is currently at 4.8% system-wide and heading towards the 5.6% as contracts step up to current rates, increasing roughly 10 basis points per year.","We've had great success with our new brands, which have been developed at minimal cost. We recently opened our first Tru by Hilton just 15 months after the brand launch. The property located in Oklahoma City is owned by Champion Hotels. With more than a dozen signed Trus, Champion Hotels is an incredible supporter of the Tru brand and we're thrilled to celebrate this milestone with such a great partner. We expect to open about 10 Tru hotels by year end and an additional 75 next year. There are currently 425 Trus in various stages of development, of which roughly 90% are with current Hilton owners. According to STR, Tru represents more than 30% of the U.S. industry's midscale pipeline.","We also continued to get great traction on our conversion-oriented brands where deals can move quickly through our pipeline and add to unit growth in the year without increasing industry supply. Curio, our four-plus star conversion brand, continues to attract both domestic and international attention. Over the last several months, we opened our first Curio in the Middle East and signed several projects across Continental Europe. As of the end of the quarter, we had nearly 90 Curio hotels opened and in the pipeline. Our newest conversion brand, Tapestry by Hilton, sits just below Curio in the three-star category. At quarter end, we had 60 projects signed or in various stages of negotiations. Additionally, we're on track to open our first Tapestry in the second quarter, less than six months after the brand's launch.","In addition to new brands, we think our existing brands have terrific upside, especially in the international markets. Last week, we opened our 100th hotel in China, up from just five hotels under a decade ago. Today, our pipeline in China totals nearly 275 hotels and 70,000 rooms driving our number one ranking in rooms under construction in the country, and 21% share of total rooms under construction in the Asia Pacific region.","We celebrated a major milestone in March with the opening of the Homewood Suites, French Quarter in New Orleans, which is our 800th hotel in our all-suites brand portfolio. This segment has been a really strong performer with RevPAR Indexes over a 120, and we expect to have another 350 suite hotels open over the next two years.","Marking another significant milestone, today we actually opened the Hilton Rio de Janeiro Copacabana which is our 100th hotel in Latin America. This brings our supply in the region to more than 17,000 rooms across nine brands, with another 70 projects in the pipeline and shows our continued commitment to strategically expanding our footprint, particularly in resort destinations and key international markets.","We're also taking full advantage of our global scale to roll out industry-leading innovations. Guests continue to prefer our web-direct channels, which made up nearly 30% of distribution mix in the first quarter. This is our highest level ever and web-direct continues to be our fastest growing channel, increasing more than 200 basis points in distribution mix year-over-year. Our Hilton Honors app is downloaded every eight seconds and is the highest rated travel app providing unprecedented choice and control for guests. Through this app, guests can check in, download their digital key on their mobile device and head straight to their self-selected room upon arrival. By the end of this year, we expect to have digital key capability at all of our hotels in 80 major North American markets and 2,500 hotels globally.","In the first quarter, Honors members accounted for 57% of occupancy, up nearly 2 points year-over- year. Additionally, paid member folio increased more than 8% as new members join the program, and existing members move up the tiers, enabling us to capture an even greater percentage of their travel wallet. We ended up the first quarter with 63 million Honors members, up 19% year-over-year.","Post-spins, we're a resilient fee-driven business with a very disciplined strategy that's focused on growing market share, units, and free cash flow per share, as well as preserving our strong balance sheet and accelerating our return of capital.","We estimate a 1 point change in RevPAR growth impacts our adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 1 point, roughly the same as every 10,000 net unit adds on a stabilized basis. This year, we expect to add 50,000 to 55,000 net new rooms with great sight lines for the next couple of years, given that we have nearly 170,000 rooms currently under construction. Given the resiliency of our model, modest changes in RevPAR do not meaningfully impact our free cash flow generation potential, and we intend to be very disciplined in returning capital to shareholders. To provide more clarity, we expect to return $900 million to a $1 billion to shareholders this year with around $200 million in the form of quarterly dividends, and the full balance in share repurchases.","At our core and critical to our continued success, we are a business of people serving people, and our team members strive to provide exceptional experiences at every hotel, for every guest, every time.","I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work and commitment to our shared purpose to be the most hospitable company in the world. Hilton was again named one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Our inclusion on Fortune's list is a very prestigious ranking and I think a fantastic acknowledgement of where we stand when measured against the top companies in the U.S. and around the world. This ranking is also representative of our exceptional workplace culture. Ranking at number 26 in the U.S., we increased our position by 30 places this year and we ranked number 17 globally. We're really proud of this important recognition.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin, who'll give you a little bit more details on the quarter and our outlook. Kevin?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Thanks, Chris and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, system wide RevPAR grew 3% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, which was at the high-end of our guidance due to good transient demand and strong group performance. We estimate the Easter calendar shift boosted RevPAR growth by 70 basis points in the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA of $424 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range, driven by better than expected fee growth, good cost control at both the corporate and property levels and one-time items. Roughly half of the beat was related to timing, and should not impact full-year forecasts. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.38, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and increasing nearly 60% year-over-year on a pro forma basis.","In the quarter, management franchise fees grew 7% versus the prior year to $429 million, well ahead of our 2% to 4% guidance range. In addition to timing-related items, outperformance was driven by greater than expected incentive management fees and franchise sales.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook, we believe that our broad geographic diversity coupled with the resiliency of our fee-based model, helps mitigate the impact of regional uncertainties. Following the spins, no single market or gateway city accounts for more than 3% of our adjusted EBITDA and international travelers comprise less than 5% of our U.S. room night demand.","In the U.S., comparable RevPAR increased 2.5% in the quarter, driven by strong group performance. We estimate oil and gas markets pressured growth by 10 basis points, representing a significant improvement versus the prior nine quarters. For full year 2017, we continue to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth towards the midpoint of our 1% to 3% systemwide range.","In the Americas, outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR grew 2.8% versus the prior year, due to strength in Mexico and Canada, driven by good group performance. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region at the higher end of our guidance range.","RevPAR in Europe grew a strong 8.4% in the quarter, ahead of expectations due to transient strength in London and a notably strong March for Italy, Spain and the Mediterranean region. Additionally, international inbound to the UK was up nearly 20% in the first quarter, helped by favorable exchange rates and increased travel from the Middle East. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be modestly above the high end of our range.","In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR declined 2.1% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations as supply challenges and political unrest in certain markets continue to weigh on results. Modest improvement in Egypt helped mitigate weakness. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region of flat to slightly positive.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 5.5% in the quarter, led by stronger than expected growth in China and solid performance in Japan. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the mid-single digits, with RevPAR in China up in the 6% to 7% range.","Moving onto capital allocation, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the quarter for a total of $50 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the second quarter. As Chris mentioned, we initiated our stock buyback program in March and have since repurchased over 2.1 million shares for a total of $123 million.","The previously announced HNA acquisition of 82.5 million Hilton shares, or a 25% equity interest from Blackstone, closed in March establishing a long-term investment in Hilton. We believe this strategic partnership will be mutually beneficial as both companies leverage their networks and relationships.","Turning to our balance sheet, we successfully executed over $9 billion in financial transactions in the first quarter, including amending and extending our $4 billion of term loans, refinancing our $1.5 billion of senior notes and unwinding and replacing our interest rate swap portfolio. Collectively, these transactions lowered our cost of debt by 25 basis points, reduced our interest rate risk with roughly 75% of our debt now at fixed rates and extended our average debt maturity by approximately a year and a half. We now have no meaningful maturities for six years.","For the second quarter of 2017, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be 1% to 3% with the unfavorable calendar shift likely resulting in growth in the lower half of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $490 million and $510 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of between $0.47 and $0.51.","As Chris mentioned, we are maintaining our full-year 2017 RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3%, but are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion. We expect the return between $900 million and $1 billion to shareholders this year in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We're also raising diluted EPS, adjusted for special items to $1.73 to $1.81 for the year. Please note that our full-year EPS range does not incorporate incremental share repurchases.","Further details on our first quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, sir. We will now begin the question and answer session. And your first question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hello. Chris, since you last reported, last quarter were talking about some of the post-election euphoria. And since you last reported, some of that's worn off. But there's certainly been fits and starts in sentiment, particularly now as the President is trying to put through an ambitious tax plan that could be very favorable for business. So, certainly the sentiment plays a role in lodging demand. And I'm wondering have you seen group demand and business transient demand ebb and flow with different ways of sentiment or has the uncertainty regarding various administration policies caused corporate customers to sit on their hands again?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah, that's a great question, and I think one that's on everybody's mind to sort of get to the fundamentals of what's going on with demand in the business. What I would say is, breaking it apart into the two segments. First on the transient side, we've seen it in the leisure transient remained relatively healthy. We haven't seen lot of ebb and flow there, both pre and post elections. If you think about pre and post election with business transient, which had increasingly pre-election, I think, we all know become quite anemic to flattish. Post-election, we saw it step up a little bit. And we've seen it remain pretty consistent since.","So, we saw a little bit of post-election bump and it's remained, I mean week by week obviously things move around, but if you have sort of cleansed the data, our read of the data is it's been relatively consistent. We haven't seen any further pickup. I think my opinion is there is potential to see further pickup. I mean, you're looking at some \u2013 while the GDP print in the first quarter was quite weak, there is certainly I think still an expectation that GDP growth, as I said in my prepared comments is going to be better this year than last year. If you look at non-residential fixed investment numbers, which have a very high correlation to demand growth in the hotel business, the fourth quarter of last year was the first quarter in a while you all saw it go positive, and the first quarter was quite positive. I mean, it's almost \u2013 it's very high single-digits.","Now, if you look at the data, generally, improvement in business transient will be in a lag to that \u2013 to non-residential fixed investment numbers going up. So, I think if you look at those numbers, there's a bit of a reason for optimism. I think ultimately time will tell. I mean, it's early in the year, it's early in the Trump administration and this legislative agenda. And I think we need to see it play out. I think to see it go from a little bit of a bump post-election to see further upside, I think you have to see some things settle down.","There's still a decent amount of uncertainty around certain foreign policy issues going on and the legislative agenda, health care, tax reform, infrastructure, the regulatory. I think the regulatory is pretty stable and I think people view that as quite positive. Healthcare, unclear, maybe have clarity in the short-term. Tax policy, a lot of work being done on that and a lot of thinking going on on infrastructure. So, I think as those things play out and you have a little bit more certainty, particularly if it's viewed as positive in the business community, and I would say tax reform being the most important of those, I think there is potential to see incremental increases. Again, having said that, what we're seeing is relative stability at the moment.","On the group side, which we've had tons of questions about, not surprisingly there's been lot of dialogue about it over the last week or so. What I would say is we feel pretty good about the group side. I'd say if you look at system wide group performance in the first quarter, we covered it in the prepared comments, frankly it was a lot better than we thought it would be. In that, of course, you had the Easter effect which helped but we knew the Easter effect was coming. It was better even factoring for the Easter effect. If we look at the full year forecast for what we think for group at the moment, it's a bit a better than it would have been a quarter ago or two quarters ago. So, that we feel good about that. If we look at our current position, system-wide on the books we feel pretty good about it and it certainly supports what we think we need to deliver in the group side for the year. If you look at the pace numbers, which I think people have been focused on, you got to parse those really carefully because everybody sort of defines it in slightly different way. So, I would sort of break it down maybe into three categories.","Pace in the quarter, in the first quarter, for the quarter \u2013 in the quarter, so very short-term group business was actually up quite nicely, okay. So that was positive. Pace in the quarter for the full year of 2017 was down marginally. That should be expected and it follows the pattern that we've seen over this recovery in the last few years, which is you'd very occupancy levels, you're lapping over high occupancy levels, you have 85% of your group business on the books and so sort of the math \u2013 the math on that is you would generally see some of the pace and position numbers decline a little bit as the year goes on.","Another I think really important pace number is looking at in the quarter \u2013 in the first quarter what were bookings like for all future periods, not just this year, but into the \u2013 in the future years. And that was up pretty meaningfully. So again, I think generally support of a feeling reasonably good about group. April, we got the date on the last couple of days. Pace was up quite nicely in April, obviously the beginning of the second quarter. By the way April overall, even though you have the reverse of the Easter effect, I will say performance wise, April is better than we thought it would be.","And as we look at in the 2018, 2019, the position is quite \u2013 is quite strong, so maybe more than you wanted to know, but I know a lot of questions on this. I think that we feel fine relative to the range of guidance that we've given overall, and I think group's contribution to that, I think we feel \u2013 we feel good about group for the year, and group going forward.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. You answered like all five of my follow-up questions.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Okay.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Okay.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In the past you talked to the \u2013 good morning \u2013 you talked to the benefits of network effects for the whole company. As you look at the pipeline growth and RevPAR growth in international market, specifically, which continue to build, are you already getting the benefits of those network effects, and what are the key puts and takes to think about the pace of the international pipeline going forward?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","That's a good question, I would say. I don't think that we're fully getting the benefits of the network effect. It depends where you are in a world where \u2013 where we built out, places where we built out, broader distribution we are getting more of the benefit. But there is \u2013 none of them have been built out to the same degree as, Steve, as we have in the U.S. So, I think that there is certainly opportunity there. I mean, one gauge, I don't have the exact numbers in my head, but I'll tell you if you look at our average market share in the U.S. versus the other mega regions, the other mega regions have very good market share, and rapidly approaching the market share of the U.S., but not quite there.","So I think there is still more opportunity in that regard. I think as time goes on by just by definition of the scale of our existing footprint and the size of the population centers outside the U.S. and our under-representation, I mean we're in 104 countries in the world. We are in a lot of places, but we are at the tip of our iceberg of international growth. If you just do the math that's increasingly over the next 5 years or 10 years, you're going to see our percentage growth coming from other places around the world.","So we're really \u2013 I mean, we look at these market share numbers, as you can imagine every week, we visit with our teams around the world. And I have been really pleased in the last two years or three years that those market share numbers are supporting our theory of the network effect that as we're building out broader distribution in other parts of the world, that we are rapidly sort of approaching similar market share numbers. But in terms of ultimate growth potential, I think the sky is the limit. I mean, you think about the populations around the world that we can serve and you think about the layering of existing brands, let alone newer brands that we're launching. We have tremendous and I would say sort of, certainly for my lifetime, unlimited opportunity to continue to grow.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then as a quick follow-up, where was your RevPAR index in those other markets compared to the U.S.? Are you seeing those close the gap similar to how the U.S. market has matured? Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah, I mean, I said that. I think they are both on an annual basis, quarter-by-quarter moves around. I think they are both within a couple of hundred basis points of the other mega region, EMEA and APAC are within a 100 basis points, 200 basis points of the U.S. and they've been moving up materially over the last few years at a rapid pace.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","May be just to touch on a pretty specific one as it relates to the guidance. We noticed that you raised your fee guidance from 6% to 8% up to 7% to 9% it looks like for this quarter fee numbers came in much better than expected. So, number one, just what's driving the increase in guidance? And then number two, if you could, is there some room for some of those same line items to possibly continue to improve as we move throughout the year?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. Shaun, it's Kevin. The increase in the fee guidance for the year is pretty much \u2013 I think I mentioned it in my prepared remarks that about half of the beat was timing-related items, and half of the beat was just pure performance and a good chunk of that was in the fees. So, what you're seeing is kind of carrying through the beat to the full year guidance for the balance of the year. And so, of course, if we ended up \u2013 if we were to end up near the high end of the range on RevPAR over the course of the year, of course, the fee guidance could continue to go up. But that one point increment in the range is just the carry through from the first quarter beat.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And to be specific, Kevin, just as my follow-up, it was primarily IMF and is it a initial franchise fees and anything you're seeing on that initial franchise fee line item we should know about?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","No, it was kind of broad based, right. I mean the RevPAR came in at the high end of the guidance. So, that's going to push fees to the high end and then IMF was a little bit better and then franchise sales, which is a combination of change of ownerships and new deals, was better than we thought. Some of that timing and some of it's just better than we thought. So it's pretty broad based on the fee side.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Sure.","Operator","The next question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","I wanted to go back to a comment that Chris made about leading returns to owners. Can you just walk through what do you think is driving that and its sustainability, is what you're doing easily \u2013 can it be easily copied by your competitors?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Certainly I don't believe it can be easily copied. I think Harry it's a complicated answer, obviously. But I think at its core it's about having better more consistent brands, which means product that is in each and every one of the brands and categories consistent service delivery that is consistent, ultimately a commercial platform that is hitting on all cylinders, all elements of sales in our res systems and revenue management and our online business and marketing and all of those things sort of coming together to drive performance. And then the other thing that it is not easily replicable is you can have really good products, really consistent service and good commercial engines, but in my humble opinion, without having a network effect, meaning having broad price point distribution as well as geographic distribution, you just by definition can't take as much of a share of wallet from customers and as a consequence you can't drive the same level of market share.","So, it's all of those things, which of course I'm going to say, I run the company and we are going say that we think they're unique. We don't think \u2013 we think we are one of a very limited number of people that have a real network effect. And in terms of having the purest brand portfolio in the business, we think we got it, meaning that every one of our brands in every category is either the leader or a category killer in its segment. There is no dogs in the bunch. So when owners come to us for various needs that they have, where they are following demand patterns, whatever those might be or whatever type of product or price point, we have a great product to give them, where we're going to drive consistently market-leading market share and that's what they're investing in. They are investing in a system to drive top-line and bottom-line performance and drive the best return. I think the fact that we've been able to lead the industry in driving growth and doing it organically without having to use our balance sheet in any meaningful way, it's a pretty darn good testimonial to that. Now we have to keep doing it.","So, we have to make sure that as we launch new products they're great products, that they really resonate with customers, that we have consistency and the high quality, that service delivery. I said we're a business of people serving people and we are \u2013 service delivery matters a lot. But that network effect of connecting all of those dots around geography and price point matters a whole lot and I think ultimately what we have is awfully unique.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Thanks, Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will come from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Chris, before, in your development pipeline commentary you mentioned that 52% of the pipeline is under construction which gives you pretty good visibility to net rooms growth. You also referenced in the press release that construction starts in the first quarter are up 50% or nearly 50% from year ago levels. What's driving that? Is it simply developers just wanted to get in front of interest rate moves and accelerate the financing timeline?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Those, yeah.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Or is it something else? And then--","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","No.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...also the 325,000 rooms in the pipeline, what percent of those projects are fully financed at this point?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","I probably can't answer the second, I'll ask Kevin to take a shot at it, but the \u2013 in terms of the first, the numbers are accurate. We're up construction starts 50%, I do not think that we will be up 50% in construction starts for the full year, okay, just to be clear. That is an accurate data point, I think for the year, it will be less than that. What's driving the first quarter and that's going to help us a lot in the year is I think that we're sort of firing on all cylinders in all segments, but the thing that really accelerated first quarter was Tru, new brand launch, lots of Trus getting under construction. It's the lowest price point we have in terms of cost per room to build, much more financeable than a lot of other products in a financing market that, is sort of stable, but got a little bit tighter, it remains a little bit tighter. So I think proportionally we're getting more of the financing dollars.","The other driver of it was huge good things going on in China with limited service, particularly with our deal with Plateno, a ton of new Hamptons that went under construction in the first quarter and we're going to have a ton more coming, but my sense is, it will stabilize out that the Tru and the Hampton in China help supercharge the first quarter a bit.","In terms of the 325,000 in the pipeline, it will be under construction, certainly half of it \u2013 that would be financed, half of it's under construction, so it's financed. So I would say somewhere around the order of 60% to 70% because there is a 10% or 20% and I'm sort of guesstimating that would be on the verge of getting under construction or probably committed, so conservatively I'd probably say 60%.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. I think that's probably right, Joe. It's hard to have perfect visibility. And the other thing to think about is, I think, most of the focused-service projects particularly in the U.S., they may not be technically fully financed, but they'll get financed, because most of the folks who are building those are repeat developers, they've really strong relationships with their regional banks. And at the end of the day, if it's a viable project, they're going to get it financed. But I think Chris' guess is pretty good, but it's hard to have full visibility into that.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone. Thanks and good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Chris, you spoke a little bit about business transient trends and kind of what you saw pre-election, post-election. And if we go back to when you guys spoke in February on your 4Q earnings call, I think one of the comments that you made was, if you can get business transient in that 1% to 2% range, that would maybe lead to the higher end of your 1% to 3% guidance range for the year. Could you maybe comment on how things have shaped up since then and kind of where you're tracking relative to those metrics?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","That's a good question. I'd say we're probably tracking in that zone. There is no ways week-to-week and month-to-month, but I'd say we're in the 1% to 2% zone and as we were sitting around every Monday morning, and I started with EC call with all of our senior folks from around the world, I did it yesterday like I do every Monday and we go through the performance in every major regions of the world. And I'd say there's generally a level \u2013 a decent level of optimism in all of our \u2013 from all of our folks coming out of April where if we look at all of the regions I think everybody felt like April was trending better and as they go into May and June, they're feeling reasonably good. So, to get to the higher level of range, I'd say right now and we gave you 2 point range in outcome because it's early in the year, okay. And I think that's the prudent thing to do. If you put me on the spot a little bit, where \u2013 if I had to refine that more or where do I think it'll be, honestly what I see right now real time in talking to our teams and looking at the data, I would say we'd be at the mid to the high point. That's what forecasting, current forecasting would suggest.","Now, there is a lot to play out in the year. There is a lot going on. We talked about legislative agenda, foreign policy. There is lot out there. But we've got \u2013 it's not roaring, but we got pretty good stability in the range of outcome that we talk about and business transient, leisure transient hanging in there and I gave you a long soliloquy on group that makes me feel with our position in group for the rest of this year reasonably good that it's going to deliver what we want to deliver there.","So yeah, we're in that zone and I will say we feel good about delivering or suggesting we're going to deliver.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And if I may, just a quick follow-up. Obviously you guys have the dividend in place, offering about 1% yield now. When you think about 2018 and growth in the business, how are you thinking about the trajectory of the dividend and maybe what kind of benchmarks are you using in terms of thoughts to grow it?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. I mean, we're really sort of in the 20% or 25% of free cash flow. So, as the free cash flow goes up, I think there could be some modest increases in the dividend. I would guide you to not expect that this year. I mean, I think we're going to be stable with where we are. But there we'll be potential in future years as free cash flow goes up.","I mean, we \u2013 as you probably gathered from our commentary, we're a lot more focused on returning capital in the form of buybacks. We obviously want to have a dividend, we want yield investors to be able to invest in the stock. But in terms of driving great, sort of market leading total returns to shareholders over a long period of time, we think being relatively modest on the dividend side and much more robust as robust as we can on the buyback side is going to lead to the best long-term returns.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just maybe the first part of the question, Chris, I'm just curious and I know that politicians have thrown out some new tax plans. I'm just curious how potential the new tax policy affects your thinking on capital allocation and leverage. I recognize it's a little bit of wait-and-see, but I just wasn't sure what might be kind of in your thoughts.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. It is definitely a little bit early, and it's wait-and-see. I mean they've thrown some things out there, and we've had some pretty good discussions with folks that are on the point on this to get a bit of a sense of what's going on behind the scenes. I think they're darn serious about getting something done, and I would not at all be surprised if when we finish this year it is something done or something is pretty well baked in getting done.","I think from my point of view, whatever they're going to do \u2013 all of the options that we're looking at I think are going to be good for our business. I think now it could turn out a different way but certainly everything that's sort of being fancied about, the net result for us is positive, meaning that it's going to ultimately drive more free cash flow. And so it doesn't really change in any way our capital allocation policy, it just may change the amount of capital that we have to allocate, meaning if taxes go down, free cash flow goes up.","Our belief is and our strategy will be to return all of that cash flow back to shareholders too again largely in the form of incremental buyback. So, I think same plan, just may have \u2013 if they get something good done, we'll have more to play with.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then just a follow-up. I mean setting asides for these macroeconomic drivers like non-residential fixed investment for a moment, what are some of the positive and negative considerations from the operatings out of the industry that are really shaping your outlook? Is that the pricing pressure from supply maybe offset some of the strong pipeline deliveries you have or do you see an ability to renegotiate with OTA? I was kind of curious of what bubbles up from the industry itself that really drives your view on Hilton?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Well, I mean, that's a complicated question and I am not exactly sure there is a succinct way of answering and I think it's sort of a combo platter of everything. I mean, our model now as we've talked about is pretty simplified, I mean, it's really focused on continuing to do everything we can with our brands, and our commercial strategies to drive share. So we drive unit growth, and if we do those two things and outperform, we're going to drive incremental cash flow, which we're going to give back to shareholders.","And so, there are a whole bunch of things sort of bubbling around the industry that are going to contribute to that, whether that be on OTA renegotiations over time, which will obviously continue to take place, whether that be finding other distribution partners that are very efficient distribution partners, that allow us to have access to new customer bases. Importantly, our direct strategies, which we've talked a lot about over the last couple of years, and are going to be strategies that go far into the future, this evolution of Honors and having it be a real club that everybody wants to be a member of has a real value for both frequent and infrequent travelers, there is a huge amount of opportunity still left there to continue to take, what, 30% online business and grow it to a much higher share of our business.","So, there are multitude of things that we're going to do. On the commercial side, there are multitude of things that we're going to continue to do with our existing brands to make sure they continue to be relevant. New brands, which we've talked about, we've launched one this year, we've got four more in the skunkworks which obviously will help us deliver from a Hilton point of view incremental growth, but importantly it's going to help us further that network effect that I talked about to give us an opportunity to serve you and more of our existing customers, bring new customers into the fold.","So, there is a bunch of company specific, industry related things that we're going to do, but it's \u2013 again I can go on for a long time, it's a complex strategy, but the ultimate goal and sort of the holy grail is share, you know, it's all of those things are \u2013 so that we can drive incremental share to drive incremental profitability to owners, so they want to continue to invest tens of billions of dollars in our system.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Search. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about some timing [Technical Difficulty] (46:25.).","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","We can't... (46:30.)","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Your line is breaking up unfortunately.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","I'm sorry. Can you hear me better now?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Unfortunately, no.","Operator","I'm sorry, sir your line is breaking up. I need to move on to the next question and that will be from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks. I wanted to just follow-up on the development question, I'm just wondering, have guys seen any change in the willingness of local lenders to finance developments just from, say, versus a year ago? Do you think that's getting easier or harder to bring a new property to market?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","I think on the margin it's stable. I think throughout the second half of last year and maybe a little bit of this year, but really second half of last year, it became incrementally. The market became a little tighter, a little harder, terms were a little tougher, the loan-to-values were a little lower, pricing a little higher, all of those things. My sense in talking to our development teams and lots of owners is that it's relatively stable.","Certainly I would say relatively stable for the owners that are very good borrowers that have been out doing this as a part of their business over an extended period of time. So from the last quarter, not any material change.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick \u2013 it's a small question, but your Conrad hotels showed a RevPAR decline in the quarter driven by 5% decline in rates. And I was just wondering if there were something in particular there that was going on, that was maybe seasonal or regional?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Those \u2013 just a couple of individual hotels, it means it's not that many hotels. So a couple of individual hotels that had just off group pace for the quarter and a couple off-group pace (48:18).","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","For the full year, the numbers are fine. But yeah, this is small enough system where you have a couple of hotels have a huge impact.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Just in terms of your major...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning, Tom.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Your major corporate customers, were there any industry verticals that really stood out in terms of underperforming or outperforming?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Not really. In preparation for the group \u2013 the call, I'm going through our quarter-end numbers, I had our sales folks in here ask them the very same question. Nothing really stood out. They said it's been generally consistent as between industries. I mean, maybe with the energy sector being the exception where you're starting to see a little bit of outperformance relative to where it's been given what's going on in the energy sector, but otherwise pretty consistent.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then, China, any more granularity about what are the strength in that quarter and what raised \u2013 drove you to raise your guidance for that segment or country? Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Well, we've raised guidance a little bit for the year because we performed at 10% for the quarter. We are just seeing part of it is hotels ramping up more strongly, part of it is the economy is holding in in China and maybe a little bit of overlapping of some of the constraints that were going on last year in China.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. So, two follow ups from something you discussed earlier. First is when you talked about the pace of group in the year, I wonder if you could comment on how rate trended during Q1 for forward periods? And I have one other follow up.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","I don't have that data. My recollection, they can look for it, my recollection is that was up modestly.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then the other revenue lines, and you gave a lot of color that was helpful on kind of incentive management fees and franchise fees. The other revenue line was up about $20 million which is lot of maybe with the close to the dollar amount of EBITDA beat. I wonder if you could give a little bit of color on what was in the other revenue line that was....","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yes. Some of the-Robin, some of the one \u2013 I mentioned I think \u2013 I did mention that half of the beat was one-time items and they were just a couple of \u2013 sorry, timing items and a couple of timing items were in that other fee category that just shows up in other revenues. So, that's why you saw that spread there and that will normalize over the course of the year.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Is it the same color on what some of the items might have been?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","I don't want to get into specifics, so just a couple of random things we can talk a little bit more about, specifics if you want offline.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks. Sticking with a geography question regarding your performance in Europe which was up 8%, stronger than we had thought and I believe the segment accounts for 12% of your EBITDA, so it is fairly important. Your guidance of slightly above the 1% to 3%, could you elaborate, just a little bit in terms of why you expect to see the deceleration? Is that just a factor of comps or maybe just being a little cautious there? Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Sorry, Chad, what region are you talking about?","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Europe.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. Maybe, I think, Europe was obviously particularly strong in the first quarter. We're expecting some of that to normalize over the course of the year. We still think it will above the high end and that's just pretty much all that went into that.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, regarding the buybacks, could you help us think about programmatic versus opportunistic and how the April buybacks kind of fit into that thesis? Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. I think we've tried to be abundantly clear on what we intend to do this year at this point, $900 million to $1 billion total minus $200 million in dividends. So, $700 million to $800 million of buybacks, all of which we're doing essentially programmatically. The course we're on we just I think began the program on March 8, because we had to get the approvals from our board of directors, and all those things that you guys saw. So, I think where if you were to look at what we did in the month of April, March and April combined, I think we're on a trajectory to sort of be in that range and if we're not, we'll will obviously adjust the range. A large part of that period of time was under a plan that we couldn't alter because we were in a quiet period. So, it was clicking along based on a predetermined grid. We can obviously now post-earnings adjust that grid and we will if appropriate to get to the numbers that we've talked about.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yes.","Operator","The next question will be from David Beckel of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks so much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about international trends inbound into the U.S. It's been a while since the couple of failed attempts to enact any sort of travel ban by the administration. Has that caused any sort of pullback in corporate or group activities that you've seen?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","If you look at the broader trend, interestingly last year international revenues \u2013 revenues from international arrivals was down about 3%. So it was off for a host of reasons. I'd say last year predominantly the strength of the dollar, maybe a little bit what was going on post election, but there wasn't a whole lot of year left post election, so I think it was predominantly dollar. If you look at it in the first quarter, which is obviously at this point the only data that we have, revenues from international inbound business was actually up a little bit, I mean not a lot, I mean it's sort of flat to up 1% and it-- but it's not consistent from the various places around the world.","But if you look at the \u2013 you break the world apart, it was up from Canada and up from Asia Pacific. It was down from Mexico and down from the Middle East. I think in part related to some of the things that are going on politically, the net of which was \u2013 it was up a little bit. I think where the dollar is today, and some of the other things that are going on, our expectation is for this full year that you're going to see international business down a little bit, maybe sort of circa notwithstanding was up in the first quarter, maybe circa where it was in \u2013 where it was for the last year.","Now, a lot of things can play out and change \u2013 change that outcome, strengthening or weakening of the dollar. The dollar has sort of backed up a little bit, which is helping. Now, we're getting ancillary benefit. Europe now is a decent chunk of our business, and arrivals with the weakening of the pound over time, and these are the things that are going on. You've seen that-- part of the reason you're seeing Europe surge and have such strength and why it's an expectation of being performance wise above the high end of our guidance ranges. So, we do pick some of the back up over there now. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, it's about 5% of our system wide business. So, it's moving, obviously being positive is always better, but these are the types of movements that we're talking about don't have a material impact on the bottom line result, and certainly don't have any material impact on our ability to drive cash flow.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Bellisario of Baird. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","We haven't touched on the credit card yet, which sounds like it could be a nice catalyst. Could you provide an update on where you stand with those negotiations? And then, how we should maybe think about the potential upside to earnings if and when that deal gets inked?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. I think we talked about it a little bit on the last call, and the update is that we are still in our process. We went out and we did an RFP. I think the good news is we're nearing the end of that process. I am hopeful that we're actually going to be able to get it done in the second quarter. We're in fairly advanced stages of negotiation, so I'm not going to be able to give you any sense of where it's going to end up, because we're not done.","I will say at a high level, I think it's going to be very good for everybody involved, meaning I think it's going to be great for our customers, because we're going to create a customer value proposition that's far better than what we have today, which I think ultimately is good for them, and will help us drive incremental share. It's going to be great for our overall system in terms of driving more business into the system, and it's going to be great for us in the sense of driving more fees from that segment of our business.","I know you'd like to know what it is, but it's not done, and so I'm going to stop there, and when we get it done, we'll give you a little bit better sense of it.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Perfect. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Chris, I was looking at the...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Good morning, Bill.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","... I was looking at the \u2013 good morning \u2013 the Lodging Econometrics report last week on the U.S. pipelines, and what struck me was that your, I think it's 1,250 or so hotels that are in the pipeline, so few of those are traditional full service Conrad, Waldorf, the Hilton...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","You are talking about the U.S.?","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I'm sorry \u2013 U.S., yes, U.S.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Okay.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And I'm \u2013 what I'm wondering is, how do you think about the aging stock of traditional full service hotels, whether that opens the door for more nontraditional competition and how that may shift your fee income over a longer-term basis as you're more dependent upon select-service hotels than you are full service hotels going forward?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. I think if you look-- Bill, it's a great question. If you look at our pipeline and compare to any of the major competitors, so you look at the overall numbers across the entire U.S. system, you're seeing the bulk of the development go on in a limited-service space. There is a real simple reason for it. You and I, and I think everybody knows it. And that's \u2013 that is \u2013 that's where the demand growth is, that's where the economics work and that's why owners are investing money to build new properties in those segments because they're getting the returns there.","And when you look at the costs to build and to operate and cost to build new construction for full service and luxury, it works in a few places, but it doesn't work in many. I mean, we have \u2013 we have a bunch of stuff going on. I think we have more luxury stuff going on in the U.S. than anybody. We just opened Conrad in Chicago, we're getting to go under construction in DC, the Waldorf Beverly Hills is going to open next month.","I mean, if you add up we get going out in the U.S. in luxury, probably \u2013 I think more than anybody, upper upscale, we are doing great relative to our competitive set. There're just not a lot of it going on because it's not justified because construction costs continue to go up throughout the Great \u2013 after the Great Recession and through now in a way where it makes it in most markets quite difficult.","Having said that, in terms of our existing stock of hotels, we're very focused and have been on making sure that we're keeping those up to snuff. So in the end, while we're are not \u2013 this development cycle doesn't involve a ton of-- of upper upscale and luxury, for us or anybody by the way, it doesn't mean that we're not cycling through and being very thoughtful about the existing products we have whether that'd be DoubleTree, Hilton, Embassy or above and making sure that we're doing everything we need to do to make sure that the product is relevant and that it ultimately can be competitive.","And so I feel great about what we've been doing in the capital investment side with our owners because particularly now post-spin, this is not -- we are not the owner of anything in the U.S. market, but if you go around and look at what's opening, you go around and look at what we're refurbishing around the country, I feel really good about, but this is \u2013 this is a phenomena that's driven by underlying economics. And I'm not going to say that at same point you're eventually going to get back in the full service and luxury development at a larger scale.","I don't know if it's in this cycle though because I don't see economics that on a wholesale basis are going to support it for some time. And again selectively it's being supported because we're obviously doing some of it, and so are our competitors, but wholesale, I think the game is in limited service, and I think that's an important nuance to our model because I know there's noise out in the market from competitors and the like \u2013 I think in the end our model is a capital-light model and ultimately we're trying to serve customers and the way we serve customers is giving the products they want, in the locations they want it with service delivery that is in keeping with the particular price point that they're \u2013 that they're willing to pay for.","And given that we're not investing, we're investing \u2013 it's third parties that's investing this capital. What we're doing around the world is following demand patterns and the capital is following that demand pattern. And so in the U.S. that means a lot of limited service.","By the way, around the world that means a lot of limited service. It doesn't mean that we're not going to do tons of luxury, and upper upscale and all those things, it just means that, with a growing middle class around the world, a huge amount in the next 5 years or 10 years or 20 years of demand growth is going to be in the mid-market. And by the way, I'm very proud to say we are really happy to serve the mid-market, particularly given that every time we add one, it's a 100% margin and an infinite yield.","So, the more we do, the more money we make. And the more money you make and the better we serve our customers and the greater network effect that we create. Again, that's not to say we're not going to do tons of Hiltons and Embassys and DoubleTrees and Conrads and Waldorfs. We're going to do those too when the economic rationale supports it and we can deliver for owners' returns commensurate with their investment.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great answer. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Rich Hightower of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Just two quick follow-ups on the capital return side. First of all, in terms of repurchases and not being included in EPS guidance for the year, is there a technical reason for that since we kind of sort of already know, what the number is going to be?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","Yeah. It's just \u2013 Rich, it's just a standard that we've decided to take. You don't know at what price you're going to buyback. So why guess the share count going forward. There is nothing more to it than that.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Clear enough. Thanks, Kevin. And then a second one on back to the dividend policy question. To the extent tax reform does happen and the rates on dividend income change. Would that in theory potentially change your dividend policy or would you seek to kind of keep the payout roughly the same and the balance with buybacks as you...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc","I think the idea is we'll keep it roughly the same, unless something really radical happens. I would never say never, we want to be intelligent depending on what happens in the world. But based on everything, we are hearing that is possible in terms of outcome, it would not change our philosophy on the dividend.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Thanks, Chris.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jill Slattery","Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the risk factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call.","You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today\u2019s call in our earnings press release and on our website at IR.Hilton.com. Unless otherwise noted comparisons to the company\u2019s third quarter 2016 results assume that the spinoff transactions had occurred on January 1, 2016. Please see our earnings release for additional details.","This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company\u2019s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. Before I get to the specifics on the quarter, I\u2019d like to briefly recognize all of those around the world who have been impacted by recent natural disasters it\u2019s something that was brought into vivid reality as I recently visited our teams down in Puerto Rico and in Houston. It\u2019s been an incredibly challenging time for these communities and for our team members that serve them. At the same time it\u2019s been really inspiring to see our teams come together to support one another and their communities, and I want to thank them for all of their extraordinary efforts.","Now turning to the quarter in our performance, the third quarter as the new simplified Hilton in our strong performance continued. We delivered bottom line results above our guided ranges and are raising our outlook for the year our performance continues to demonstrate the resiliency of our fee based business that can drive adjusted EBITDA well ahead of RevPAR growth with minimal use of our capital and generate meaningful free cash flow for shareholders.","The fundamentals we discussed last quarter are largely unchanged. Excluding the impact of holiday they shifts and whether overall RevPAR trends had been generally in line with our expectations this quarter and consistent with what we\u2019ve seen all year. We continue to see steady business transient and group growth at the low-to-mid point of our guidance range and leisure transient at the high end. Group pace in the quarter was up improving position for the balance of the year. Strength in international markets particularly across Europe and Asia Pacific continues to boost system-wide results. Assuming a similar cadence for the remainder of the year we expect system-wide RevPAR to come in at or slightly above the midpoint of our 1% to 3% guidance range. So far in October, which contributes approximately 40% of the quarter system-wide RevPAR is slightly ahead of expectations.","As we look to 2018, we feel good about the set up and even better about our ability to continue delivering value beyond what broader fundamentals give us. Economic indicators point to a macro environment slightly better than this year with growth in U.S. GDP and nonresidential fixed investment forecasted to increase year-over-year. In the roughly 30% of our business where we have decent sightlines, we see 2018 group position ahead of this year and we expect corporate negotiated rate increases of between 2% and 3%.","Supply remains modest and with U.S. supply growth forecasted at around it\u2019s 30 year average. Given that set up we should have a similar level of pricing power next year leading to 2018 system-wide RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3%.","Turning to the development side. Year-to-date we\u2019ve opened nearly 300 hotels with roughly 40,000 rooms and we remain on track to deliver net unit of approximately 6.5% for the full year. With over half our pipeline already under construction, we have very good visibility into our unit growth, and as a result, would expect net unit growth of around 6.5% again next year. We are committed to thoughtful and intentional organic growth that allows us to strategically expand our global footprint. We believe this approach will continue to enhance our network effect and ultimately grow our share of global development. This is evident in our growing pipeline, which reached a record 335,000 rooms in the quarter, up roughly 13% year-over-year and representing a market leading 40% of our existing supply.","With year-to-date pace ahead of expectations, we now forecast full year 2017 approvals to exceed our record of 106,000 rooms that was achieved last year. In the U.S. we continue to gain traction with conversions. We recently welcomed the London and New York City to our portfolio. We will oversee a full renovation of this property. After which, the property will be reflagged as the Conrad New York Midtown. This prestigious 562 key hotel become the Conrad brand second property in New York City and will set a new standard of smart luxury with a spacious all-suite product.","Speaking of London, I\u2019m pleased to announce today that we are announcing the Waldorf Astoria brand is set to make its London debut in one of the capital\u2019s best known monuments. The Admiralty Arch Waldorf Astoria will be one of London\u2019s most prestigious addresses, literally at the entrance to the mall and facing Buckingham Palace. Following an extensive refurbishment program, which will restore and protect this iconic landmark, the hotel plans to open with 96 luxurious hotel rooms and suites and three world class restaurants.","The Asia-Pacific region represents our largest growth opportunity with roughly 400 hotels totaling over 90,000 rooms, the region accounts for a quarter of our pipeline and we\u2019re opening more than one hotel per week there. In the third quarter, we opened the Waldorf Astoria Chengdu in China, our 200th hotel in the region and the latest in a fast growing luxury portfolio. We also celebrated the arrival of our first Curio in China, our ninth brand in the country. Located on Hainan island, the 266 room resort demonstrates our ability to attract unique asset to our soft brands given the favorable value proposition that our system offers.","Over all our global growth is driving increased loyalty from our guests, increasing our overall market share, and delivering strong returns for owners. A couple of weeks ago, we hosted nearly 3000 attendees at our global owners\u2019 conference in Dallas at the Hilton Manetobe. The theme of the conference was the power of our network effect. This is created by bringing our industry leading brands with global scale and change scale diversity together with a highly relevant loyalty program and the best commercial engines in the business to deliver increasing customer preference and ultimately leading returns for our owners.","Innovation is a critical driver of our network effect, and our app is the key platform for that innovation. In addition to being our fastest growing and lowest cost distribution channel our app also enables the deep integration of the on-property experience into the mobile devices of our guests allowing a direct differentiated customer experience. Our app currently enables digital check in with room selection globally, as well as digital key for Hilton Honors members. Our most recent enhancements and enable members to upgrade a check-in much like airlines upsell preferred seats.","Through a recently launched live chat function members can also engage on property team members directly for any requests they may have. Coming soon is connected room, the first truly mobile-centric hotel room through the app members will be able to seamlessly control their rooms lighting, HVAC and entertainment options including preloaded and streaming content. Owners who also benefit from room and energy use that will support environmental and operational improvements. We\u2019re in beta testing in select hotels now and expect to formally launch connected room next year.","In summary, we\u2019re pleased with our performance this quarter and feel really good about the set up as we head into 2018, in which modest RevPAR growth can drive meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth and capital returns for shareholders. Our teams around the world and our purpose-led culture they bring to life each and every day are critical to this ongoing success. I\u2019m pleased to announce that just this morning, we were once again selected as one of the world\u2019s best multinational workplaces by a great place to work, placing in the top 10 and joining a group of 25 elite global companies recognized for high trust, high performing workplace cultures in 2017.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Kevin to give you a little bit more detail on the quarter. Kevin?","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. For the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.3% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis due to strong leisure demand and international results. Calendar shifts displaced business travel and group demand in the quarter with the July 4th and Jewish holiday timing shifts weighing on July and September. System-wide we estimate the RevPAR benefits from hurricanes Harvey and Irma largely offset these major calendar shifts.","Adjusted EBITDA of $524 million was above the high end of our guidance range and exceeded the midpoint by $24 million. Indeed, it was largely driven by better hotel performance and non-RevPAR driven fees, and some benefit from FX and onetime items. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.56, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and increasing 37% year-over-year on a pro forma basis.","In the quarter, management franchise fees grew 11% versus the prior year to $512 million, well ahead of our 7% to 9% guidance range. Hotel performance and greater license fees drove outperformance in the fee segment, while continued strength in the UK and Japan led to better than expected results in our owned and leased portfolio.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook. Comparable RevPAR in the U.S. was roughly flat with calendar driven group under performance particularly in convention business offset by continued strength in leisure. We estimate that the two major calendar shifts negatively weighed on U.S. RevPAR by approximately 70 basis points in the quarter partially offset by a lift in business from the aftermath of the hurricanes. We estimate that our hurricane-related benefit was less than the overall U.S. industry due to our meaningful occupancy share premiums in those markets.","For full year 2017, we continue to forecast the U.S. RevPAR growth towards the lower half of our 1% to 3% system-wide range. In the Americas outside the U.S. third quarter RevPAR grew 3.4% versus the prior year due to strength in Mexico, which was driven by strong transient demand. Leisure transient in particular saw high single digit room night growth for the quarter. For full 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region at the higher end of our guidance range.","RevPAR in Europe grew a solid 8% in the quarter, ahead of expectations due to transient strength in the UK, Turkey, and Spain. Additionally, international inbound to Europe was up nearly 11% in the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2017 RevPAR growth in the region to be in the mid-to-high single digits.","In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR growth was up 20 basis points and significantly ahead of our expectations, as the reversal of the holiday shifts that benefited the second quarter were less of a drag than we anticipated. We saw strong group performance in Saudi Arabia, and improving leisure business in Egypt. For full year 2017, we now expect RevPAR growth in the region to be at the higher end of our guidance range.","In the Asia-Pacific region, RevPAR increased 8.3% in the quarter, led by strength in Greater China, which was up over 13%. RevPAR in China showed continued transient strength at both established and maturing assets. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth for the region to be mid-to-high single digits with RevPAR in China up in the 9% of range.","Moving on to capital return. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 during the quarter, for a total of $147 million in dividends paid year-to-date. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. We expect to return between $1 billion and $1.1 billion to shareholders or about 5% of our market cap through buybacks and dividends this year.","Since initiating buybacks in March, we have purchased $693 million of shares at an average price per share of $63.17. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth between 1% and 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $453 million to $473 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.41 to $0.45. We\u2019re maintaining our full year 2017 RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3%.","As Chris mentioned, we expect full year growth at or slightly above the midpoint of the range. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $30 million at the midpoint to $1.93 billion an increase of more than 9% year-over-year. We\u2019re also raising diluted EPS adjusted for special items to $1.87 to $1.91. Please note that our full year EPS range does not incorporate incremental share repurchases.","Further details on our third quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Denise, can we have our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely Mr. Jacob. [Operator Instructions] And your first question this morning will come from Joe Greff of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Greff","Good morning everybody.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Greff","I know it\u2019s early days here, Chris, so we appreciate your comments on the early read for 2018. But can you just talk about the same store RevPAR guidance for 2018, and how much of it is rolled up a corporate versus from the region, and then how do you think about it from a geographic and from a segmentation perspective relative to 2017?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, good question, and I know Joe, probably the number one question on people\u2019s mind, is sort of what\u2019s in front of us. So as we do every year, we go we\u2019re sort of in the middle of budgets season now. We are to be honest, not complete with that, but towards the later stages of it. Certainly, we have a very good sense on the topline, which is why we\u2019re happy to give some level of guidance there. And so, what I would describe it as is the case every year, we do it on a very granular basis. Every hotel in every region of the world has worked on a budget and those are all rolled up to aggregate to a global budget, regional and then a global budget. So this is not in any way top down. I mean we certainly have used top down, but this all happens bottoms up.","In the guidance you would typically get from us is about what you\u2019d expect, which is we\u2019re aggregating it up. We have a budget and we\u2019re trying to create an upside and a downside to that. So said another way, the expectations should be we are generally going to have budget. So they\u2019re somewhere sort of the midpoint of that guidance range. And that the basis for that is, as I described in my introductory comments, which is a demand growth environment that we think is going to be steady to a little bit better. I mean the optimistic side of me says everybody still things GDP growth around the world and in the U.S. is going to tick up.","Everybody still believe that we\u2019re seeing it in our nonresidential fixed investment numbers are going to generally picking up, particularly here in the U.S. and that should lead to some incremental demand growth. The supply side, as I covered, is fairly stable. I mean various numbers are out there, but it\u2019s generally somewhere at two or a little bit below, which is not too terribly different than what we\u2019re seeing this year. So you put those two things together, I think our best assessment is that we\u2019re going to have a year next year, at least as we look at it right now. We look at budgets, and we look at all regions of the world. We\u2019re going to have a year \u2013 next year much like we\u2019re seeing this year.","In terms of the geographic representation, again I think it\u2019s similar to this year. I would sort of at a high level say that topline growth is going to be here in the U.S. probably at the low to the midpoint of the range, and we would expect international growth to be greater, so probably at the midpoint to the high end of the range.","Joe Greff","Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from a Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli","Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. So Chris, as you kind of expanded on your thoughts on 2018. When you think about the one to three and you think about the \u2013 obviously a lot of proposals currently being thrown around right now, but if you were to get some form of tax reform. A, kind of how long do you think you start to see that show up in the operating results, and B, what kind of impact do you guys kind of foresee that having from at least a business transient perspective.","Chris Nassetta","Yes, another good question. I wish I knew the answer to that. I\u2019m spending here \u2013 given that I\u2019m inside the Beltway, we get a heavy dose of politics here when you live inside the Beltway in Washington. We obviously care a lot about tax reform for a whole bunch of reasons, so I definitely personally as well as others in our organization been very engaged with our industry and very directly with Congress is there, and the administration is there trying to figure out what path it will take.","There are different forms of tax reform that is sort of coming together, there are some general themes that I think are now becoming pretty consistent rather than get in those individually. And those will, I think become clearer over the next week or two, because the things are moving quite rapidly, particularly in the house and then will flow over into the Senate. I think in the next week or so you\u2019re going to start to see tax reform with much more specificity than the high level dialogue. And I would say very good into details, that I think generally it\u2019s headed in a good direction, I would say just my personal opinion that there is a real opportunity that this gets done. I think that, that is time will tell.","But I\u2019d say you asked me last quarter versus this quarter, I would say, I\u2019m much more optimistic this quarter that something will get done just based on the state of play, knowing exactly what gets done is the trick and I\u2019d say we\u2019re slightly premature on that. But from the standpoint of the industry, and then I\u2019ll talk about Hilton in a very high level way. Again, it depends what happens. But I think generally for the industry, I think it\u2019s good, I think like anything there\u2019s a lag effect to good things happening, and those flowing through the business. I can\u2019t tell you what that lag would be, I know there is a lag, but I think it happens in two forms honestly.","One is psychology, which matters and that is the business community and others feeling better about where the economy is going. I think that can happen if tax reform gets done. I think that starts to flow through pretty quickly. And then the second form of benefit to the industry is just all of what tax reform means, which means businesses have more free cash flow to play with that means that they hire more people, they invest more in plant and equipment, nonresidential fixed investment, investments should go up, it means if it\u2019s done.","The way that I\u2019m hearing it\u2019s going to get done, you\u2019re going to have huge amounts of repatriation of money that\u2019s been trapped overseas coming home, some portion of that is obviously going to get put to use in those same ways. And those things may take a little bit of time to trickle through because it takes time for those benefits to flow through to businesses. But clearly those are benefits, and clearly, I think for the industry incrementally that helps drive positive demand.","So I think, if they get it done, and as I say, I think there\u2019s a reasonable probability that something gets done, I think net-net it\u2019s good for the industry. I think for us, again just depends on the nuance of thousands of moving parts. We\u2019ve looked at all of the various proposals, it could change, so I want to \u2013 full disclosure, I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t know exactly where it will come out. We\u2019re in deep in the dialogue and have a reasonable sense. I think, the things that we\u2019re hearing being talked about, I would say the net effect should be beneficial to us.","Now trying to scale how good it is for us, I won\u2019t do, just because it\u2019s too early, too many moving parts, but certainly nothing that I\u2019ve seen that\u2019s on the table right now. Let me put it the positive. Everything I\u2019ve seen this on the table right now would be beneficial to us like a lot of other businesses, because the whole point of this is the stimulus economic growth and get more hands, more cash in the hands of businesses to make more investments and hire more people, and I think we would be a net beneficiary of it.","Carlo Santarelli","Great, Chris, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","Hey, good morning everyone. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the select service brands again this quarter, I mean, I think we all expected the U.S. was going to be a little light, given all of the calendar shifts that were going on for the quarter. But we sort of look into decomposition, your select service brands were underperformed \u2013 some of the broader portfolio as we look at a particularly some of the big flagships like HCI and Hampton. So I guess the question is, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about occupancy premiums there, and is there a place in as we progress through the balance to this year into 2018 where we might be able to get some price at those brands or what\u2019s the competitive landscape look and outlook for that side of the portfolio as we head out to year?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, Shaun, obviously, good question, and those brands are an absolute RevPAR growth basis were at the lower end of our spectrum of brand this quarter. I think, I\u2019ll hit the occupancy premium \u2013 I guess rate part of it. Second, but the first part those brands are very high RevPAR index brands, right, they perform really well. They start out ahead of the competition right, so there absolute RevPAR growth in the quarter is still higher than their competitors, but the other competitors are coming up partially because they do have such high occupancy premiums. You also had the effect in the quarter of a benefit from the storms, didn\u2019t endure to those brands as much because they already, so far, had not seen, so the other hotels were filling up more quickly, or I guess, more incrementally more than they were. In terms of the rate side, what you\u2019re seeing in those brands, I think is what you\u2019re seeing overall which is that their recovery has not been as strong in GDP growth has not been as strong, and as a result, their inflationary environment has been quite low, so you haven\u2019t seen as much rate growth.","You should see \u2013 continue to see rate contribute more to RevPAR growth in the U.S. this year it\u2019s almost one 100% of our RevPAR growth is from rate, less so outside the U.S. So it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag with those brands, but the end of the day those brands are really strong brands. They\u2019re still preference by owners and lenders in a big way and they should continue to perform really well for us.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill Crow","Hi, good morning folks.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning Bill.","Bill Crow","Good morning. We\u2019re not that far away from hitting kind of a three year anniversary of the time at which we identified weaker corporate demand. And we\u2019re also still trying to figure out exactly why. And I know economic growth hasn\u2019t been that good, but confidence is up. Corporate profit is up. You\u2019ve highlighted many of those things. So I\u2019m just wondering in your discussions with your clients, in your special corporate negotiated rates, is there anything you\u2019re uncovering that helps to explain this weakness at this point in the cycle? And maybe growth is coming from small companies, not big companies or something like that, but anything that you can give us?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I mean it\u2019s a really good question, right, in terms of going forward what it\u2019s going to change to get the business transient moving at a faster pace. And we\u2019ve studied it like crazy. I\u2019ve talked personally as with our teams to all our corporate clients, big, small, medium everything. So I don\u2019t have any \u2013 I\u2019d love to tell you I have some brilliant new insight, but I don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s really a consequence of even though you see broader economic indicators and nonresidential fixed investment in those things sort of improving. I think it\u2019s just been \u2013 I\u2019ve used this before, I think, on prior calls certainly as I\u2019ve talked to folks, it still been a little bit of a cautionary flag out there.","So whether you\u2019re big, small or medium sized business even though there is some optimism out there and maybe certainly tax reform within as I said improve that psychology, there\u2019s enough stuff going on politically and globally that we\u2019re all reading about and we all know about that. I think it just it\u2019s holding people back from that incremental decision to spend and that includes incremental spending in travel. As we\u2019ve talked to our corporate clients, it\u2019s been interesting not particularly new, and I\u2019ve talked to a bunch of them, I think what they\u2019re saying, and you heard it in our prepared comments that we think we\u2019ll have sort of 2% to 3% growth with them. That\u2019s all rate.","Okay, you wanted \u2013 somebody asked where is the rate? Well there it is. That\u2019s all rate, sort of a quasi inflationary increase, simply because I think when you talk to them they say, hey we\u2019re reasonably optimistic about our business in the world, but my gosh, a lot of things going on. We need to see things stabilize a little bit. I think people\u2019s expectation at this moment as we\u2019re talking to him pretax reform, et cetera, is I\u2019m willing to accept the rate increase not a big one, but sort of inflationary and my expectation is and I\u2019m aggregating a whole bunch of different people and a bunch of different categories, obviously, but I think volumes will be relatively constant. And so that\u2019s sort of what we\u2019ve built in as I described a bit earlier in my answer to the prior question. That\u2019s sort of what we\u2019ve built into our expectations for next year.","To get them moving a little bit faster, I think, one, having \u2013 continuing to see an uptick in the broader economic environment. I think, getting \u2013 posting some wins on the board, I think honestly, I don\u2019t want to put anything on the shoulders of tax reform, but I think that is the one we get the highest probability and where you\u2019re going to have the most significant impact to sort of change the psychology a little bit to make people feel like we\u2019re getting some things done, it\u2019s going to be really good for me. My business is going to benefit from it, and so I can loosen the purse strings a little bit.","I think having said that, we\u2019re growing. I mean, special corporates are growing. You see business transient this year sort of growing over all in the 1% to 2% range. So it\u2019s not flat going backwards, it\u2019s still positive. But not nearly what we would like or what you would typically see at this stage of the cycle. But I think this is different just because of the noise that\u2019s in the system and the overall caution. And I\u2019m an optimist by nature, everybody on the call knows that. But I am optimistic that particularly tax reform and other, you start to see things settle down and I think it will be helpful to the business.","But we haven\u2019t really \u2013 I can\u2019t say that I can look at data \u2013 I mean, I can look out if I wanted to sort of be super optimistic, I can look at certain weeks and a little bit of a trend that it\u2019s getting a little bit better. But I would say I\u2019m getting ahead of myself to say that I\u2019d say that the bulk of the data, which has been somewhat choppy, still suggest it\u2019s been positive, but relatively stable. We haven\u2019t really seen any kind of material uptick.","Operator","The next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning and thank you. Chris, in an industry that doesn\u2019t have a lot of visibility, we rely on metrics like GDP and corporate demand to kind of try to form the forecast, and you talked about those a lot. And I\u2019m just curious because it seems like the corporate demand \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I meant, not to say nonresidential fixed income. And it seems like corporate demand this year has led nonresidential fixed investment. So I\u2019m just wondering why you think it wasn\u2019t as correlated this year? Is there a lag or is that maybe not the best metric to look at?","Chris Nassetta","It\u2019s a really good question, and I\u2019ve been pushing our teams on that. And we\u2019ve studied \u2013 the best analysis that we\u2019ve come up with is the correlation is still very, very strong but it\u2019s a longer lag in a low inflationary environment, and that\u2019s the environment that we have been in and we can likely will be in for a while. So I do think it will flow through. Correlation in a low inflationary environment will probably mean a lower correlation and a longer lag. So if you keep seeing growth in nonresidential fixed investment, eventually you\u2019re going to see some benefit flowing through the hotel demand.","Felicia Hendrix","Looks like a good basis, and then combined with GDP that\u2019s\u2026","Chris Nassetta","It\u2019s still the best \u2013 I mean, when you do the math and look at the RF squares, It\u2019s not to be too nerdy about it, but that\u2019s how our guys look at it. It\u2019s still \u2013 those are still the best ways we can find. You\u2019re right, it has detached a bit and so I was \u2013 Kevin and I were pushing the teams. And when you do the analysis, it really has a lot to do \u2013 if you look at it over 30 or 40 years against different inflationary environments, that\u2019s as best we can tell, where it starts to break apart at least in terms of creating greater lags.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from question will come from Brian Dobson of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead,","Brian Dobson","Hi, good morning.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Brian Dobson","So when you\u2019re looking at supply growth, is there any sign that, that might be slowing in urban markets where supply has been high and pricing has been weak? And then in terms of your own growth out over the next two years, which of your brands are driving that growth? And how developers received your new brands?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, thanks Brian. So the first one is I think you are seeing indications that, well, certainly, new projects getting signed up in urban environments are more difficult to finance and you had a bunch s market where supply has become a little bit of a problem. So obviously, developers are looking else where. You\u2019re still seeing deliveries in some of those markets, right? New York, Chicago, the oil patch, you\u2019re still delivering some of that. So on a lag, you\u2019re still going to see actual supply deliveries, continue a little bit, but I think if you look at projections more broadly outside of Urban, you\u2019re starting to see the forecasters or the forecast are starting to level off.","So I think what the industry consultants would predict is that 2019 is going to be the peak year. And we probably \u2013 I\u2019d probably personally take the under on that a little bit, meaning I think 2018 and 2019 will be about the same and then you\u2019ll sort of see them be collective, peak going forward. For us, in terms of our brands, you still have the core Hilton brand and Hampton that are the largest part of the pipeline and this will be the largest deliveries. But of course, we have new brands that are ramping quickly with Tru and Home2 and some of our conversion brands, so I think you\u2019ll continue to see our work supply growth in our deliveries be more of the same. The trends will continue.","Brian Dobson","All right, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling","Hey, thanks, good morning.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Stephen Grambling","This is somewhat a bigger picture question, but given all the efforts and the connected room and that, how do you think about the right amount or even general benchmarking of technology spend? And could provide any additional details on kind of major CapEx markets of this year and how back is the ball going forward?","Chris Nassetta","Sure. I mean, technology makes up a huge component of how we want to differentiate ourselves broadly. I mean, I think it\u2019s a combination, obviously, of making sure our physical products existing and you are exactly what customers want. And we\u2019re either launching or adapting to their needs. That the physicals combined with service that is differentiated and very consistent and very high quality that our loyalty as we continue to evolve, Honors becomes \u2013 much increasingly more relevant. They were interacting with customers in a deeper, more frequent way. And last but not least, using technology as a differentiator, recognizing that we can use technology in ways we talked about today in our prepared comments in the on-property experience to make it more seamless, better, more fun, more efficient. But also, we have unique opportunities to talk to our customers in ways we never have been able to before, before and after they\u2019re with us and technology obviously offers us a way not only to talk to them, but to engage them in different ways on a more frequent basis.","So we\u2019re front of mind. Obviously, all with an objective of being able to continue drive more market share, more profitability for owners and in so doing, attracting more capital into our system to accelerate our growth. So you\u2019re going to continue to see us make very large investments in technology. The bulk of those investments in terms of the dollars are really coming out of our all of our programs and technology funds that come from contributions that are made by all of our owners on a global basis and not as much as what you see the pure CapEx numbers that you see in the $150 million to $200 million CapEx number that you\u2019re seeing than when we talk about our CapEx fees, the amount in technology there is probably $20 million to $40 million. I\u2019m looking at Kevin, something like that.","And that\u2019s really more corporate systems of all sorts. HR, financial systems, et cetera, that are really Hilton investments. I think you\u2019ll continue to see that level of investment there. The big investments, which honestly are10 times to 15 times or more of that number that we\u2019re making in terms of the innovation and what we\u2019re doing with technology in the hotels is happening in the funded side of the business. And I think you\u2019re going to continue to \u2013 we have a huge amount of resources to play with. I think, you\u2019re going to continue to see us increased spending there is somewhat. But really just make sure that how we\u2019re allocating dollars and what we spend it on and how we prioritize it is done \u2013 is appropriate for what we\u2019re trying to get done to deliver great experiences for customers. We got plenty of money in that bucket to do the right things. It really is making sure we just focus on the right things and prioritize properly.","Operator","The next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Hi good morning and congrats on another strong quarter. So two more So two more questions on 2018. First, Chris, you had the conference recently and you talked about some potential new brand launches. Can you just tell us your expectations for 2018 and potential size of new brands? And can you talk about capital returns for 2018, just the gives and takes of all the driving capital return side.","Chris Nassetta","I\u2019ll take the first, maybe ask Kevin to talk about the second. New brands. Nothing new from what we talked about in prior calls. We\u2019re always working on lots of different ideas. I\u2019d say we have four new brand ideas that are sort of in the skunk works and under heavy development. We talked about those. We affectionately call our Hilton Plus \u2013 sort of Hilton Plus brand, an urban micro brand, what I did talked about get, the luxury collection brand and I think that\u2019s all \u2013 sorry, luxury lifestyle, I was saying. I have three or four, luxury lifestyle. I\u2019d say three of the four of those, the first three the luxury lifestyle being the fourth, we\u2019re way down the development path of luxury lifestyle. We\u2019re not rushing as much because we have a number of different things going and other three that are keeping us busy.","I would expect and I don\u2019t want to \u2013 it\u2019s not a high commitment but I would expect probably the launch of two or three of those four during 2018. And it sort of depends. It\u2019s hard to put a hard date on it because we just launched really Tru and I mean we launched it a couple of years ago, we had the first opening that are going on this year and just launched Tapestry this year at our first opening. We\u2019re still cranking up with Curio and even Home2, which is doing incredibly well. We\u2019ve had five new brands over a relatively short period of time, to effectively this year. So we want to make sure, I say pretty consistently, that we give them a proper birth. They\u2019re all doing well, but we want to give them a little bit more room, finish the development on these others. So I would say two or three of the four, I think, are highly likely at some point next year. And as we get into the beginning of next year, I think we\u2019ll give you a little bit more specificity around that.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. And then Thomas, on capital return, as Chris mentioned earlier, we haven\u2019t finished our budgeting process. So it\u2019s a little bit premature and we\u2019re certainly not giving guidance. But I think if you look at what we\u2019re saying about RevPAR growth and those combined for next year, I think it\u2019s safe to say that EBITDA will grow next year based on our outlook and thus, free cash flow will grow. We expect our return on capital next year to be directionally comparable with this year. And I think the thing to a number about that and the reason that it will probably be directionally comparable even with growth is we had some excess cash at the beginning of this year left over from the spend that is part of our capital return for this year.","Thomas Allen","Helpful, thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks, Thomas.","Operator","The next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks. I was just wondering if you can update us on the bookings channels, given all the efforts you\u2019ve made around loyalty programs and the apps and the technology that you touched on earlier. Are you seeing a movement to more customers booking direct through your Hilton.com and away from, say, OTAs or other channels? And if you can, could you quantify the move?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. I don\u2019t have all the most recent data in front of me. But I would say directionally, things are going really well with our book direct campaign. We continue to see tremendous growth coming in through Honors, which is the way to get started. We\u2019ve been doing more than 1 million new members a month. We\u2019re up to about 70 million numbers. We\u2019re almost up 30, I think it\u2019s 26% to 27% year-to-date growth in Honors. And that obviously, as we get people onto the system, gives us an opportunity to talk to them and engage with them in a very different way, which we are, including them and making sure they understand that they get the best value with discounts with points, with all the technological advantages that we talked about in terms of digital check-in, room selection, digital key all of those things that are offered to Honors members.","And I think it\u2019s going really well. If you look at the channel shift over the last couple of years, it continues to pay the highest growth that we\u2019re seeing on a year-to-date basis continues to be in our direct channels. And I think we\u2019ll continue to see that if we do our job. As I\u2019ve said lots of different times over the last couple of years, this is not going to be \u2013 we\u2019re happy to talk about at quarter-to-quarter until it\u2019s appropriate to get the question and answer it. But we\u2019ll be talking about this for years and years to come. This will never end. It wasn\u2019t sort of a onetime surge. It\u2019s about making sure that we\u2019re always offering our customers the best value and delivering the best experience. And as much as we can, as I said, engaging in a deeper, more frequent way with them to have a very direct relationship.","We think that\u2019s important. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want to have relationships with distribution partners. We do. We have literally hundreds of them around the world and we have good relationships with them, and there is a certain segment of our business where it\u2019s very helpful to us to work with them as long as we have reasonable economic terms and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But the more that we can add those direct relationships, the better, not just because of the cost of distribution. That\u2019s obviously an element of it, but just experience for our customers that we can have much more control over the experience.","So you\u2019re going to see us \u2013 you\u2019re going to see lots of new things coming from us and our marketing campaigns on what you\u2019re doing with the digital side, overall technology. We talked about some of them today. Things that we\u2019re doing with Honors like connecting the Amazon and points building. All of these things are really of part of that equation of giving our customers or reasons to want to engage more often, more deeply with us and to have all the more reason to have a direct relationship with us. And we think it will ultimately drive distribution cost down and is driving distribution cost. Down to be clear, it is, but it will also ultimately drive share up because it will drive more loyalty.","Smedes Rose","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning, guys. Hilton and other brands certainly have a few initiatives in progress such as revamping cancellation policies, I guess, you call it nonrefundable reservations. And I\u2019ve heard that you and maybe other folks are revamping like the rewards redemption programs out there to make it little more favorable to orders. I\u2019m just curious for Hilton, do you expect these programs will be adopted system-wide actually at some point in 2018? And, I guess, which of them do you think ultimately could be the most beneficial to room rates or RevPAR?","Kevin Jacobs","Jeff, I\u2019ll take the cancellation policy first. We did instituted a new cancellation policy this year. We\u2019re actually in the third quarter where we\u2019re now at a combination of 48 and 72 hours depending on the market. And earlier, it\u2019s early days, but the early returns are that those are working, those are helping stem the tide of really short-term cancellation. So you\u2019re seeing sort of one-day out cancellations down a few points as we get into that. We\u2019re also working on \u2013 I\u2019m not exactly sure what you\u2019re referring to or you\u2019re hearing, but we\u2019re working on and testing, I think Chris has spoken about this before on calls testing, a new way to price where maybe the customer\u2019s paying a little bit more or a little bit less in advance for different levels of flexibility.","And then on the Honors side, we made changes in recent years on the redemption formula to make it more fair to all owners whether they\u2019re in high occupancy markets or otherwise. But I don\u2019t know if you want to elaborate more on that.","Chris Nassetta","No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any major changes in the redemption side of Honors to speak at about at this point. I think Kevin covered others. Is there anything else, Jeff, that you were trying to get at?","Jeff Donnelly","No, I think that\u2019s a large part of it. I was curious, I know it\u2019s early, but I\u2019m meaning the cancellation policy has been successful and kind of lengthening booking window? I mean, how do you guys kind of think about it with a desired goal?","Chris Nassetta","It\u2019s really early days, okay, but meaning months in. But it\u2019s definitely working. And I think that, as Kevin said in concert, we\u2019re rolling out next year, changes in sort of how we price all our products, sort of taking it from the 48 or 72 hours to seven days and then seven days and beyond with a flexible or semi-flexible product pricing approach, I think, is going to help accelerate \u2013 help benefit us and deal with this issue in a more meaningful way. And ultimately, in a way that I think drives higher growth just because as we look at the behavior of customers as we are testing it, as we\u2019re doing it at a fairly large scale throughout different pockets of the portfolio, we like what we see. And I think net-net, it has an opportunity to incrementally make customers happier by giving them choice and drive better RevPAR growth. Now you\u2019re going to say give me more details, but I\u2019m going to say I\u2019m not yet, because we\u2019re deep into the testing, I think we\u2019re going to complete it the next 30 or 45 days and if all goes well, it\u2019s something we\u2019ll describe and in far greater detail, because we\u2019ll be rolling it out next year.","Jeff Donnelly","Thanks for answering my third question. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Great. Two things. One, just wanted to understand the group pace a little bit better, I know you said its up during the quarter. I\u2019m wondering how much that may just be benefiting from the holiday shift that makes Q4 better quarter than last year. Can you talk about what bookings that came in during Q3 for 2018 versus last year in Q3 for the forward year?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, Robin, I don\u2019t have the exact breakdown in front of me, but booking \u2013 pace was up in the quarter both into the fourth quarter and for all future periods and as far as 2018 how is looking right now, it\u2019s actually, 2018 position is up more so then 2017 position is going to end \u2013 we think is going to end up on the whole, so up sort of low single digits, but up better than it is this year.","Robin Farley","Okay, that\u2019s great. And lastly, so much upside in your guidance rate since your RevPAR range changed to sort of non-RevPAR related fees. Is that \u2013 should we think about that as recurring? Or is that just sort of onetime benefit to the upside in your guidance today?","Chris Nassetta","The overall there were \u2013 there were a little bit of unique items, a little bit of FX and a little bit of timing. But largely as I think I said in my prepared remarks, largely performance driven. And then the reference to the non-RevPAR driven fees we have a bunch of non-RevPAR driven fees including franchise sales and license fees and you saw a little bit of benefit in the quarter particularly from license fees.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian","Hey, good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Jared Shojaian","So we\u2019ve seen the industry pipeline the growth rate start to decelerate a bit year-to-date and then your number today is sort of in line with that. What do you make of this trend, and how should we think about your unit growth beyond next year?","Chris Nassetta","I mean, if I look at our numbers, we didn\u2019t really see any meaningful deceleration. I think, we were \u2013 pipeline growth 13% and I think last quarter maybe fifteen, so I guess technically that\u2019s a decel, but I don\u2019t really \u2013 I think that just quarter-to-quarter nuance of things going on. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening. My expectation is that you will continue to see our pipeline grow overtime obviously has a lot to do with what\u2019s going on in the various regions of the world, but I think you\u2019ll continue to see us add to the pipeline at a rate that is somewhere in that zone.","In terms of our net unit growth, as I talked about in the prepared comments, we have pretty good sightlines just because if you think about it everything that we\u2019re going to deliver next year and a whole bunch of stuff that we\u2019re going to deliver into 2019 is either under construction or financed and getting ready to go under construction with the meaningful piece \u2013 meaningful gap being conversions. We\u2019ve been doing roughly 20% to 25% conversions a year. We\u2019ve done that four or more reliably. We have new conversion brands that we\u2019re working with Curio, with Tapestry, with soon a luxury collection conversion brands.","So I\u2019m pretty confident based on our track record, based on the sort of weapons in our arsenal, will be able to get the conversions that we need. So I think looking in 2018, 2019, I think looking as we said in our Analyst Day this time last year, I think we have pretty good sightlines. I think being in that 6% to 7% zone for the next few years, I think is readily achievable.","Jared Shojaian","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one on you. On the Waldorf Astoria in New York City, I wonder if you have any idea when that might be reopening, I walk by it every day, and I don\u2019t see a lot of activity going on any rough idea?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I mean a lot of work is going on, not in the hotel, but behind the scenes on all of the planning. And I \u2013 bunch of us have been deeply involved on buying and figuring out the programming and I think we\u2019re sort of at the very final stages of that. They\u2019ve done a bit of demolition sort of what I\u2019d say is demolition to figure out what\u2019s behind all those walls in a building that whatever 100 years old, it gets tricky and what they have said is their expectation is to open in the very late part of this year, very early part of next year that they\u2019re going to be prepared to start heavy demolition elements which obviously are the beginning of real construction.","So I\u2019m hopeful that the next three to six months that we\u2019re starting to get underway. The program that we\u2019ve worked on with them is, I think spectacular. I mean, I personally spent a bunch of time on it has tons of people on our team. And I think the direction it\u2019s going will make us proud to have the Waldorf Astoria, New York back to its former glory.","Patrick Scholes","Well said. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks everybody for the time today, obviously I\u2019m pleased with our third quarter. I think \u2013 rest of the year, I think we\u2019re in really good shape and going into next as we talked about. Steady as she goes. We\u2019ll keep churn in the numbers out and appreciate everybody spending their time with us and look forward to talking to you after our next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. At this time you may disconnect your lines."],"10946":["Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.

Please also note that today's event is being recorded.","At this time, I like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Jill Slattery, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.","Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Jamie. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.

You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide details on our expectations for the year ahead. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Jill, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning for the call. We're pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results with RevPAR growth, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all in line with our expectations. We're also very happy with our continued momentum in the development side of the business.","With the spins of Park and HGV successfully completed last month, this will be the last quarter we report as legacy Hilton Holdco, as each company will be hosting separate calls to discuss their results and outlook.","As we talked about during our Investor Day in December, the new Hilton is a resilient fee-driven business. Our two primary drivers are same-store growth and net unit growth, and we are far less sensitive to changes in RevPAR, given the lower operating leverage of a more simplified model and the resiliency of our unit growth.","Focusing on results, same-store trends remained largely consistent throughout 2016. When adjusting for calendar shifts and other one-time items, system-wide RevPAR growth was essentially 1.5% to 2% throughout the year, led by group and leisure in the 2% to 3% range and business transient at around 1%.","In the fourth quarter, when you adjust for the impact of calendar shifts, Hurricane Matthew and the U.S. election, performance improved versus the third quarter, which was driven primarily by an uptick in corporate business. January performance also came in slightly above our expectations.","The bulk of our room night demand has short lead times and tends to follow macroeconomic indicators on a lag. Forecasts for these indicators, particularly U.S. GDP and non-residential fixed investment growth show modest year-over-year acceleration into 2017.","Actually, in the fourth quarter, non-residential fixed investment posted its first quarter of positive year-over-year growth since 2015 and is forecasted to strengthen further into 2017, which should lead the growth in demand for room nights. Where we have more visibility, notably in group and corporate negotiated business, we see continued demand growth. Group position for the full year is up slightly versus 2016, with approximately 75% of the business on the books. While January is a relatively light booking month, we did see positive momentum, indicating a stronger pace for the year. Additionally both group ADR and corporate negotiated rates are up 2% to 3% versus 2016.","Turning to unit growth, where we have good sight lines, we continue to take market share, with construction financing slightly more expensive and marginally harder to get in 2016, only top projects with strong brands got done, keeping industry supply growth below the 30-year average at just shy of 1.6%. It remains to be seen whether the lending environment gets better, but one thing is certain, our industry-leading brands continue to take a disproportionate share of development activity globally with little use of our capital.","For Hilton, 2016 was another record year for signings, for openings and construction starts. We maintained our position as the fastest growing global hospitality company on an organic basis, increasing our system size by 6.6% with 52,000 gross rooms opened. We opened roughly one property per day in 2016 and started construction on nearly 77,000 rooms. We signed a record 106,000 rooms bringing our pipeline to 310,000 rooms, with over half of that pipeline under construction. Globally, more than one in five hotel rooms under construction are being developed as a Hilton brand, which is 4.5 times our existing share of global rooms. Additionally, four of Hilton's brands are in the top five brands in the industry under construction globally.","Our five new brands continue to contribute meaningfully to both our supply and pipeline growth. New brands now represent nearly 800 hotels and 90,000 rooms that are either open or in our pipeline. Home2 recently opened its 135th property, with another 350 in the pipeline and is now the second largest brand underdevelopment in the United States according to Star. Tru by Hilton just celebrated its first birthday, with nearly 400 hotels representing 37,000 rooms in various stages of development. According to Star, Tru represents over a quarter of the U.S. industry's midscale pipeline and accounted for 65% of the total growth in the U.S. mid-scale pipeline in 2016. We're on track to open our first Tru hotel in the second quarter and expect to have nearly a 1,000 rooms open by the end of the year.","Last month, we launched our newest brand the Tapestry Collection by Hilton. This conversion-oriented brand positioned in the 3-star to 4-star space just below Curio is off to a strong start, with over 40 deals in progress. We expect the first Tapestry to open later this year, and believe this brand has significant growth opportunities with an addressable market of over 15,000 existing hotels globally.","We also had great success in deploying our existing brands into new markets. In 2016, we expanded our system footprint across five new countries for a total of a 104 countries and territories. Last week, for example, we signed our 100th Hampton in China with our partner Plateno.","For the full year 2017, we expect net unit growth of 50,000 rooms to 55,000 rooms, or approximately 6.5% system growth, supported almost entirely by third-party capital. We also forecast another year of robust signings totaling over 100,000 rooms.","While our scale, size and industry-leading brands and commercial platform continue to drive strong unit growth, similar attributes are also driving tremendous growth in our loyalty program. Hilton Honors added 9 million members last year, bringing total memberships to over 60 million members. For the full year, Honors members drove 56% of system occupancy, representing a year-over-year increase of nearly 400 basis points. By ensuring that all of our customers get the best value and the best experience through Hilton Honors, they are much more likely to have a direct relationship with us. Our digital channels, including website and mobile bookings continue to outpace other channels on share growth, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year.","In the quarter, web-direct as a share of all bookings was nearly 30%. We also launched a number of enhancements to our loyalty program just last month that we believe will make the value proposition even greater for our members. Hilton Honors is the first loyalty program that will allow members to choose exactly how many Points to combine with cash for a hotel stay through a Points & Money slider. Members will also be able to use their Points for purchases on Amazon.com and to allow family and friends to pool their Points for free. We believe these enhancements will continue to make Honors the most customer-centric loyalty program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.","Lastly turning to capital return, our new simplified business model with growth almost entirely financed with third-party capital, should continue to generate meaningful free cash flow. We intend to be very disciplined in returning capital to shareholders over time largely through share repurchases. We're meeting with our board of directors next week to finalize our plans and expect to provide further details shortly thereafter.","In closing, I'd like to extend a really heartfelt thank you to the Hilton team, as well as the teams at Park and HGV for the successful completion of the spins. As you might guess, breaking up a 100-year-old company is a massive undertaking. We owe the success of this spins to the hard work and dedication of team members across all three companies, and we remain very excited for the prospects of all three companies going forward.","With that, I'm now going to turn the call over to Kevin to give you a little bit more detail on the quarter and the full year results. Kevin?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thanks Chris, and good morning everyone. For the full-year, system wide RevPAR grew 1.8% near the high-end of our expectations with rate gains driving performance. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.975 billion was in line with the midpoint of our guidance range, supported by roughly 100 basis points of margin expansion. Diluted EPS adjusted for special items was $2.68. Before adjusting for the Reverse Stock Split, diluted EPS was $0.89.","In the fourth quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 0.9% versus prior year, which was at the high-end of our guidance due to better than expected transient demand in November and December. Good cost control at the corporate level somewhat tempered by softer than expected ownership margins drove adjusted EBITDA of $751 million, achieving the midpoint of guidance.","In the quarter, we took a $513 million non-cash tax charge related to a corporate restructuring that was executed before the spinoff. The charge primarily relates to the transfer of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary. For book purposes, the expected taxes on the future earnings of the IP are recognized in the quarter.","Diluted EPS adjusted for special items was $0.70 in the fourth quarter or $0.23, excluding the impact of the reverse split. Transient business grew modestly in the quarter, partially driven by better corporate performance, additionally increased demand from Hilton Honors members supported year-over-year growth.","System-wide group RevPAR was roughly flat in the quarter as declines in convention business offset modest upticks in smaller leisure-oriented group demand. Calendar shifts, challenging year-over-year comparisons and softer city-wide in key markets weighed on demand, while rates increased in the low single-digit range.","In the quarter, management and franchise fees grew 2% year-over-year to $436 million. Excluding unfavorable FX and other significant one-time items, fee growth in the quarter would have been approximately 360 basis points higher. For the full year, management and franchise fees increased nearly 6%.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook. In the U.S. comparable RevPAR increased 80 basis points in the quarter. Underlying corporate transient trends showed more positive performance sequentially. However, results were masked by unfavorable calendar shifts, Hurricane Matthew and continued weakness in oil and gas markets. Excluding the drag from oil and gas markets, we estimate U.S. RevPAR would have increased an incremental 60 basis points.","Performance in the quarter was supported by an uptick in Hilton Honors driven volume and the post election boost in corporate transient. For the full year, RevPAR increased 1.8%, largely driven by good group and leisure transient business. For full year 2017, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth towards the midpoint of our 1% to 3% system-wide range. In the Americas, outside the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR grew 2.5% versus the prior year due to strength in Canada where RevPAR increased more than 5% driven by solid group performance.","Zika concerns continued to hinder growth in the Caribbean, while economic contraction continued to drive declines in Brazil. For the full-year, RevPAR increased 4.2%. For full-year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be at the higher end of our guidance range.","RevPAR in Europe grew 2.2% in the quarter, surpassing expectations due to solid leisure transient performance across the UK and Ireland during the holiday period. Additionally, results in Continental Europe were aided by increased demand from the Middle East and easier year-over-year comps, as we lapped terror attacks in Israel. Unfortunately, terror attacks and geopolitical instability continued to plague Turkey, where performance declined 16% versus the prior year. For full-year 2016, RevPAR for the European region increased 1.1%. For full-year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth to be at the mid to high-end of our range.","RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa declined 5.7% in the quarter, driven by new supply in the UAE, coupled with lower demand levels. Continued political unrest in certain African markets further weighed on results. In 2016, RevPAR in the region decreased 1.5%. For full-year 2017, our RevPAR growth forecast is flat to slightly positive. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 1.5% in the quarter, largely due to strength in China, mitigating softer group performance in Japan and demand declines in Thailand following the death of the King.","RevPAR growth in China increased approximately 5% during the quarter, driven by the China national holiday campaign and the China winter campaign, which helps compensate for shortfalls from the recent implementation of nationwide service charges. For the full-year, RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region increased 3.5%. For full-year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the mid single-digits, with RevPAR in China up in the 3% to 4% range.","During the quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share, before adjusting for the Reverse Stock Split, bringing our full-year cash dividends to $277 million. As Chris mentioned, we are meeting with our board next week to discuss our capital return strategy, including recurring dividends and the initiation of programmatic share repurchases.","For the first quarter of 2017, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $380 million to $400 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $0.24 to $0.29. We are maintaining our full-year 2017 RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3% and expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.835 billion to $1.885 billion, including an FX headwind of approximately $30 million.","Taking into account cash on hand and anticipated working capital needs, we expect to have between $900 million and $1 billion in cash available for capital return this year through dividends, share buybacks and potential debt prepayments. We expect diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $1.65 to $1.75. Please note that our full-year EPS range does not incorporate any assumptions on share repurchases.","Further details on our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks, and we'd now like to open the line for any questions you may have. Please note that we will be focusing our comments on the pro forma Hilton business, leaving commentary on the Park and HGV businesses to their management teams. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.","Jamie, can we have our first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning and congratulations on...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hi, Shaun.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On completing the spin-offs. So, maybe I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the outlook. Chris, the last quarter, it seemed like the outlook was fairly dependent on some pretty big macro assumptions. And so, I guess the question for you is, number one, do you feel a little bit more secure in that outlook today than you did where we were sitting a quarter ago? And number two, any green shoots you can mention that you're seeing specifically to the hotel business and what you're seeing on the transient side specifically, since that's where we saw a lot of the softness last year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, a great question. I assumed, one way or another, we're going to talk about that probably on multiple questions. It would be hard to say I don't feel a bit better than I felt when we originally gave our 1% to 3% guidance. And that would be because that did have an expectation that we would see a pick-up in key macro indicators, including GDP growth and non-residential fixed investment. I think we have started to see that, and I noted it in the \u2013 in my prepared comments that non-residential fixed investment turned positive in the fourth quarter for the first time in a while. That is the highest correlation that we can find to growth in demand for hotel rooms.","I think there is a fairly high level of expectation generally out there that you're going to see positive non-residential fixed investment this year and that GDP growth is not picking up in a significant way, but picking up at least modestly. And so, I think when we gave guidance of 1% to 3%, we felt reasonably good about it at the time based on where we were in budgets. As we now have a little bit of the year behind us, we have a few green shoots that are essentially that the corporate business, the business transient business has, as I said, picked up a bit post-election. It's continued into the first part of this year. We feel like we've got a decent group base on the books. Leisure has maintained its relative strength.","So, it would be hard to say that I don't feel a bit better about our 1% to 3% than I did when we gave it to you last fall and that the opportunity to be at the midpoint or above would be higher today than it was at that time. Having said all that, it's early in the year. There is a lot going on. If you watch cable news and read the newspapers and some of the things that have created the positive sentiment, I think, in the business community relate to the idea of tax reform, regulatory reform, the possibility for infrastructure spend. And well, I think there is decent momentum on a number of those things. In the end, what will matter is what actually happens. So, I think the psychology in the business community is more positive than it was certainly when we talked last time.","How positive it gets, how long it stays positive is entirely dependent on what actually happens on some of the things that I just mentioned that are swirling. But we feel like \u2013 what we're seeing right now makes us feel like the guidance we've given is a darn good guidance. And when we look at what we've delivered so far this year, and we've already had an opportunity to work with our teams to re-forecast the year based on what they're seeing in activity, short-term plus the longer term group business, we feel pretty good about it.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like your RevPAR and fee growth guidance in 2017 has a bit of a widening gap between the growth rates. Can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes driving that shift, whether it's FX, unit growth, accelerating mix shift, et cetera?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Maybe I'm not sure I understand the question exactly, Stephen. Can you give me more?","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, I guess if we look at the RevPAR guidance, it's pretty consistent throughout the year, but yet you have fee growth accelerating for the year versus first quarter?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Well, got you. Got you. On a quarter-to-quarter basis \u2013 maybe Kevin will jump in with a little bit more detail. I think the way to think about that is two things that are going on that sort of create the anomalies on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Some of it's FX. Some of it's one-time items either that are happening this year or happened last year. If you'd cleanse it for those things, it actually is relatively consistent throughout the year.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, maybe one other follow-up just on the better corporate transient. Perhaps I missed this. But were there specific industries where you're seeing this recovery or do you feel like it's more broad based?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think we're seeing it very broad based. In fact, I was talking to our folks that lead our sales efforts about that very question earlier in the week, and I think we're seeing very broad based \u2013 more positive sentiment across a broad range of industries.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. I'll jump back in the queue. Best of luck.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Patrick Scholes. How are you doing, Patrick?","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm doing all right. Thank you. Just a couple of questions here. Can you drill down a little bit on your group revenue position as it relates to the first half of this year versus the back half of the year and how are you trending for 2018?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. We're sort of in the low to mid-single digits for the full-year with the first half of the year up more meaningfully than the second half of the year. That is not atypical in most years as we come into the year, just given the timeline. So, a lot of the in-the-year for-the-year business obviously, when we get to this point, is going to be in the second half of the year. So, we feel \u2013 again, talking to our sales teams, we feel pretty good about it.","If you look at where we ended up last year in group consumed revenue, we ended up in the 2%, maybe a little bit better. I think we're on track to do at least that. I wouldn't want to get too optimistic and say it's a ton better, given we're up 2.5% or 3% in terms of position on the books. But we feel pretty good about the first half of the year stronger, but we have \u2013 we still have plenty of time for infill in the second half of the year for in-the-year for-the-year. And as I said, that would be fairly typically how it would weight out.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And for next year, where do you stand?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Next year, obviously, a much lower percentage of room nights on the books. I want to say if we're at 75% now for this year, we may be at 20%, in the 20s for next year, but up materially. I'd say as we look at it today, Kevin, correct me if I'm wrong, we're up in the 5% to 10% range. I think towards the higher end of that range for next year at this point, but again to be balanced about it.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's right.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","There's only 25%-ish of the room nights on the books at this point, which again would be fairly typical being a year out.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And just lastly, shifting gears a bit, are you or Kevin predisposed to \u2013 when you're thinking about capital returns or debt payments, you're predisposed to any of the various combinations, whether share repurchases, dividends, debt, et cetera?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. We've been, I think, pretty clear on this in the past including at our Analyst Day in December. But maybe to make sure that we have perfect clarity, I'll do it again. I think when we think about \u2013 and first of all, as Kevin and I both said, we're going to meet with our board next week. So, everything I'm going to say is our philosophical approach, subject to our board agreeing with that philosophical approach. Obviously, we've had discussions prior to next week about how we might approach it, but next week we're going to consider it. I do expect we will walk out of our meeting next week with an approval for a programmatic approach to how we're going to return capital.","The way that we've talked about in the past and the way I'd say it again today is that there is a programmatic and an opportunistic component to how we intend to return capital. The programmatic element of it is that we would look at our recurring free cash flow, and to use \u2013 the numbers for this year is roughly $800-plus-kind-of-million, and we would look at taking a large component of that \u2013 let's use a number to say 75% of that, that would come back in the form of a modest dividend, not unlike what we had been doing pre-spin. But the bulk of it then would be coming back in the form of share repurchases in a programmatic way.","Then the remaining amount of that free cash flow and any other opportunities that we would have, including re-levering, as we described at Analyst Day, we would view as opportunistic. And so, we kind of put it in those two buckets. The programmatic, you will start to see very, very soon. The opportunistic, I hate to say it this way, but we'll know it when we see it. And we want to make sure that we have the capacity when there are opportunities that present themselves to be able to lean in and do something even more significant at those times.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Kevin, while we're talking about the capital return, I did have a question on the guidance that you announced today. It was just a little bit lighter than we had expected, given your three-year view. So, I was just wondering if it's more a function of what you think your free cash flow is this year or is there anything more mechanical like from the spin or balance sheet requirements that might limit you a bit more this year than in the later two years of your three-year plan?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, Felicia, there's nothing mechanical there. And I think we did give you a three-year model that was cumulative and we understand we didn't break it down at the Investor Day. But our free cash flow for this year is consistent with what we thought at the time, and the free cash flow per year, as the earnings of the company grow, grows throughout the time period. So, there's nothing else going on there.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And Chris, can you just comment on the recent news flow about the impact of the administration's travel ban on lodging? I know that only about \u2013 I think it's 5% of your domestic business comes from international demand. But I was just wondering more broadly if you could comment.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. That's a good question, and obviously, one that we've been fielding in lots of different forums. I'd say, as you pointed out, the international business system-wide in the U.S. is a relatively modest component of our business. If you look at what we saw in the international business last year, it was down a bit in revenue. I think it was down 2.5% to 2.8% I think but 2.5% to 3%. That was obviously pre-travel ban. That had a lot to do with the strengthening of the dollar in my mind.","You did see some markets continuing to show very good growth, mostly Asia Pacific to the U.S. But a lot of the other markets, including Canada close by, we saw drop off. As we think about this year, my sense is, and then I'll answer the question specifically, my sense is you're going to continue to see pressure on international business, and I think that pressure is largely going to be driven by even further strengthening of the dollar. If you look at what's happened over the last 90 days, the dollar has strengthened a lot. That is not good for international inbound business. So, I think you'll see continued impact.","On the other side, the good news is, part of the reason the dollar is strengthening, at least at the moment, is a belief the U.S. economy is going to be stronger. U.S. economy being stronger in-the-U.S. for-the-U.S., where we have 95% of our business coming from that net-net is a win for us in the industry.","As it relates to the travel ban, we've been tracking it as carefully as we can. We have not seen any material impact as a consequence of what's happened over the last two or three weeks. We obviously will keep watching it and keep an eye on it, but nothing in anyway material that's come from it at this point.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks everyone and good morning. Just on the RevPAR cadence, Chris, Kevin, you guys guided the first quarter 1% to 3%. Clearly, a little bit of benefit there and then a little bit of headwind coming in the 2Q with the calendar shift. Could you guys maybe quantify how you're thinking about that?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Kevin may want to jump in. The truth is with the Easter shift, we tried not to get too tricky in the guidance and keep it consistent, because it's early in the year. The truth is that first quarter is likely to be more to the higher end, second quarter probably more to the mid to the lower end just because of the shift in Easter. I guess in the end, we could have tried to be a little more precise, but it is \u2013 we think both quarters are within those ranges and we tried to keep it simple. But Easter is going to help first quarter, it's going to hurt second quarter, moving from April \u2013 moving into April from March.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Correct, but all should be captured within the range.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then, just in terms of the FX headwind, Kevin, I think you said $30 million in 2017 was built into the adjusted EBITDA guidance?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's right.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Could you possibly parse that just between the leased assets and the management and franchise fees?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Just because of the breakdown in the earnings as a business, it's more of an impact to the fee business. So, you have a larger impact in the fee business, smaller in the leased business, and then a bit of a benefit in corporate expense, because we have some offset by spend in that part of the world.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Is it close to pro rata, if you just looked at it on a company-wide basis?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, I'd say it's probably two-thirds, one-third...","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's right.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","If I had to approximate it.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's right.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Two-thirds in the fee...","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, so it's not. Yeah. If that breaks down to 90\/10, you probably go to two-thirds in the fee segment and one-third in the ownership segment.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Helpful. Thank you.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Chris, you talked about this I guess in a couple of different ways. But when you think about 2017 across the four quarters, can you talk about what's baked into your assumptions for the pace of business transient growth?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I think what's baked into our assumptions is that we're going to see, throughout the year, we're going to go from last year, where it was circa 1% to \u2013 if we wanted to get to the mid to the higher end of the ranges, we're obviously always trying to do is get the best performance we can. I think it's more 1% to 2% than 1%. As I said, I think group is going to perform in a consistent way. We don't see any leisure issues at the moment. Now, there's lots of things that could happen. But at the moment, we think leisure keeps clicking around \u2013 or keeps clicking along.","So, I think if you get \u2013 if you can get business transient up over the 1% and 1.5%, 2%, I think it's what could lead you to being in midpoint or hopefully higher than the midpoint of the range. And I think that's possible and that's sort of what we've been seeing, if you look at \u2013 if you cleanse December and January of noise, that's sort of where we've been, is 1.5% to 2% on business transient. The only caution \u2013 again, that's all great and I know I'm sort of guiding to the mid or high in those comments. The only caution is it's very early in the year, okay, and January is not the biggest business transient travel month, nor is December. They're amongst the weakest business transient travel months we have.","So, I'm not trying to be negative, just trying to be objective. We need more time to \u2013 we need more time to sort of play out and we need to be able to \u2013 as we get into February, really March, April, you get into the meatier travel season for business transient, we need to sort of track those trends and see if they continue. But again, if business psychology is more positive generally, it stands to reason and fixed \u2013 non-residential fixed investments going up stands to reason it should.","Now, I talked about a correlation, non-residential fixed investment, it being the highest correlation to growth in demand for hotel rooms. It's generally on a two-quarter lag. When you go back and you really look at it over time, the first time it turn positive is fourth quarter. If you were going to be really precise, you would say you would start to see some of the benefit of that flow-through in the second quarter of this year. So, we're going to be watching the second quarter really carefully like \u2013 well, we watch every quarter really carefully, but particularly carefully to see if you're starting to see the flow in the business transient side as a consequence of capital investment going up around the country.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And thank you for that, Chris. And just one question going back to maybe close the loop on the topic of capital return, if we were to assume the board approves the authorization, there's no other issue or impediment for buybacks to start, there's ostensibly no need to further pay down debt or anything else?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Nope. No, we \u2013 our intention, subject to our board approval, is that we will start a buyback program in the very, very near future.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, Kevin, are there any incremental spin-related costs that hit the 1Q that should be \u2013 that we should be mindful of?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","We \u2013 for the most part, we've accrued for them. So, I don't know if you're asking from a cash perspective or a GAAP perspective. For the...","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","From a cash perspective, yes.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","From a cash perspective, we still have expenses to pay, yes.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","But Joe, we \u2013 as you'll see, if you look at our year-end balance sheet, we got a lot of cash...","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","So, we basically stockpiled all the cash to pay all that.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's right.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so, what would \u2013 how would you quantify that incremental cash expenditure related to the spin then here in 1Q?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","We had \u2013 we said about $250 million in total. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but I guess it's about half.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think with all the one-times \u2013 yeah, there's a couple of hundred...","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","$200 million or $300 million of all of the one-time stuff.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It's been accrued, but we \u2013 and the cash is sitting there ready to pay it.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Just looking at where net unit growth came in, in Q4, it was towards the low-end of your guidance. I'm just wondering if that was openings that sort of slipped into Q1 or were there more removals than you were expecting. And then, your 2017 net unit growth guidance didn't change. So, if it was openings that slipped from Q4 into 2017, did kind of a similar number of 2017 openings slip into 2018 just to keep 2017 kind of unchanged?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Here, the answer on the first part is there were a few openings that just carried over to the first quarter and there were a few relatively big hotels \u2013 we had a large hotel in Cairo, one in New York and another in Rio that we had expected in the fourth quarter, and just for a whole bunch of different reasons, it will be the first quarter. If you added those in, we'd be above the midpoint or right at the midpoint, so just very modest timing differences.","The reason we didn't make any changes in the guidance to this year is exactly what I think you implied in the question is just we've given a 5,000-room range and we just didn't feel like the movement \u2013 that movement alone suggest that we should change our range, because you can have, as you pointed out, the same thing happen.","It's always touch-and-go when you're opening a hotel a day. I wish I could say that it actually worked, that it was one a day and it was that sort of balance throughout the year. It doesn't end up working that way. We generally, like a lot of folks, a lot of our developers are crushing it to get things done at the year-end. There is a lot of moving parts at the year-end every year. So, yeah, our expectation is some of that will flow over again, but a 5,000-room range sort of picked up what we thought the expected outcome would be.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. No, great. I understood. And then, the other question \u2013 and maybe you've kind of answered this. But your fee revenue guidance for the year being up 7% is not as high as your unit growth plus RevPAR growth combined would kind of suggest. Is the difference \u2013 it sounds like FX would be maybe 100 basis points. Is there anything else that's making...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. There are two real simple things, FX which is a little bit more than that, if you \u2013 I think if you do the math, and then the Waldorf. The Waldorf Astoria is \u2013 in the end, it's a wonderful story, but we sold it for $2 billion and then we got \u2013 we're going to have a 100-year management contract, but it's getting ready to close on March 1. And as a consequence, until it reopens \u2013 and when it reopens, we'll get great fees. It'll be better than what we've been receiving. But while it's closed, we will not be receiving fees. So, it's FX and the Waldorf \u2013 there are lots of little nuance things. It's a big business. But if you factor for those things, that's really what's driving it.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. So, factoring in...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Thomas.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. So, factoring in the fact that about 90% of your EBITDA comes from management and franchise fees, and within that, about 90% of that comes from base management fees and franchise fees. So, IMFs and owned segment are relatively small. But can you just help us think about if there are any kind of unique drivers of those two businesses or nuances we should think about for 2017? Thank you.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. No, I don't think there's any \u2013 the drivers are different, Thomas. Obviously, one thing to think about in the ownership segment that's predominantly leased hotels, right, so there's a fair amount of operating leverage there. And so, when you get \u2013 RevPAR at different levels and how it mixes between occupancy and rate can have an effect on profitability. And IMF, most of our IMF, as we've described, is driven by a percentage of GOP. So, we have less volatility in that segment \u2013 in that piece of our fee stream than others might have. It doesn't really go switch on, switch off. But it still has operating leverage baked into it, because it's driven on GOP. So, that's the primary difference is, the 90%, as we've described, it's 90% top-line, 10% bottom line. So, you have sort of plus or minus 20% of the business that is driven on bottom line hotel results.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","If you look at IMF, Thomas, year-over-year and you cleanse it of FX, it's relatively comparable. It's in the high single-digits, and that's what \u2013 as we suggested at our Analyst Day, that's sort of what we expect generally over the \u2013 at least the three-year analysis period that we gave you. And then again, that's because that's a pretty good growth rate, but you know a little bit lower growth rate than you might see with others simply because it's a much lower beta fee stream, because it's not sitting behind owner priorities. So, that's where it is.","Now, FX, I would say because most of it, 80% of our IMF, so 80% of that 10% of fees, if you will, is international, it gets more hit by FX. So, the high single-digits gets whacked more proportionally than the other fee base, because it is disproportionately more international, where we have the strength of the dollar impacting it.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thanks. And then, just a couple of questions on China. What are you seeing in terms of new development and overall trends in the market there? Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. The overall trends remain pretty good. We ended up, for the year last year, in the mid single-digits in same-store growth. I think we're thinking similar this year, maybe a tick below, as they continue to transition their economy, but still feel like we're going have pretty decent positive same-store growth this year in China.","On the new unit side, we continue to pick up steam. We opened 20% more hotel rooms in 2016 than we did in 2015, we think it'll be another 10% or 20% then again higher in terms of our NUG, net unit growth on a rooms basis in 2017 over 2016. And so we're making good headway. I think that the pivot we made a few years ago was a really important pivot. We've talked about it for a few years. We anticipated it ahead of I think a lot of others, and that was that in the end a lot of the growth like most markets around the world as they start to become a little bit more mature as the hotel market comes in the mid-market because that's where you have the middle-class population growth that is at a very high rate, the midmarket product is what they can afford, and that ultimately ends up driving a lot of the growth.","So, as been well-chronicled, we pivoted very hard about three years ago to start to build out our infrastructure, retool our products on both Garden Inn and Hampton, including doing the joint venture with Plateno in anticipation of that, and that's exactly what's happening. So every year that's gone by over the last bunch of years, we've seen more unit growth for our brands in that market. The composition of that unit growth has changed dramatically. We're now \u2013 if you look at next year, meaning this year, you'll see the majority or at least probably 50\/50 of our openings will be between focused service and full service and above, where it used to be essentially a 100% full service and above. So that pivot has been incredibly important, and I think impactful as an enabler to continue to keep our growth moving in a very positive direction there.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Looking at that business transient travel forecast of 1.5% to 2%, can you provide some context of what that level was for, call it, 2014 and the front half of 2015?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Much higher. By the way, I would restate the question, if I can? It wasn't really a forecast that I was giving for the record. I was saying, what would we have to see \u2013 what have seen more recently, and what would we have to see for the full year to see that we'd be at the middle or upper end of our ranges. We don't know what the forecast transient business is, so short nature. That's what we have seen in a very short low-volume period of time, and we hope that continues.","If you go back to 2014 and 2015, those numbers were probably in the 5% to 7% \u2013 if you went to 2014, I would say they were \u2013 and Kevin help me, I think they were like 5% to 7% and I'd say in 2015, they were 4% to 6%. They were moving up at a much higher clip, much more positive growth.","So getting to 1.5% to 2% relative to that is not meteoric growth. I think if business sentiment stays positive, if people think the economy is going to be stronger, and they ultimately are hiring more people, and investing more in plant and equipment and technology, I think that's very much possible. I don't think that's a hope certificate. But those things has to continue and it's early in the year, and it's early in new administration, and there are a lot of swirling winds out there. We need to just see where it goes.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Hopefully the six-year high in CEO confidence translates into more investment. Looking at Tapestry...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It certainly should logically, I mean, and it is, if you look at what happened in the fourth quarter, it is.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then looking at Tapestry, do you have any internal goal that you would like to share with us as far as signings for the year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No. No.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","We have goals that we set out for every brand with our development teams and we obviously set up our comp systems around those. But for a whole lot of competitive reasons, we're not going to get into disclosing those.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And congrats on a good year. Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hi, Smedes.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. You mentioned in your opening remarks a very strong growth in the Hilton Honors program. And as I recall, and you might have to remind us some of the context here a bit, prior to our IPO, you were able to monetize that program, I believe with American Express and at least one other credit card company or bank. Isn't there an opportunity coming up now that you would be able to monetize that again? Are you eligible to do that or can you maybe talk about that a little bit?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. What we did pre-IPO was we did a pre-sale of points, a number of companies do this across the travel industry, both in hotel, airline business, et cetera. That was a three-year forward sale and that is largely complete at this point. So, yes, that is a lever that we always have with all of our \u2013 at this point, we have two co-brand relationships with Citi, Visa and with Amex and that is something that is available to us. Whether we do that or not, I won't comment on.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And the amount there prior was something like $600 million. Is that about what it was?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's about right. Yeah, $650 million to be exact. Obviously, the system is bigger now and the size of the system is a direct sort of impact on the size of Points, because the bigger the system, the more the Points that they need to have to service their customer base with the co-brand card.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just one more extra. You mentioned the $30 million headwind from FX, is that assuming \u2013 and I'm sorry, if you mentioned this, is that assuming a constant dollar or does that assume continued appreciation in the dollar as we move through the year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It assumes the...","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","...forward curve.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","...forecast for the dollar against the basket of currencies and it does assume further appreciation, Smedes.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. In your opening remarks you mentioned that oil and gas continued to be a headwind, I think, you said 80 basis points. I'm not sure if that was sequentially or year-over-year. Could you just provide some more color in terms of if you are seeing an improvement sequentially? And then, also, how you're thinking about this from an impact standpoint in your 2017 guidance? Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure, Chad. Some of those markets are \u2013 it depends on the market, but some of those markets are not yet recovering, and part of that is supply driven, where the markets got so strong that it brought on some supply in places like Houston and Austin. So we're not yet seeing that recovery mostly because of supply. We do assume that it does get a little bit better over the course of the year just because it lapsed comps. And then the other thing that's going on is, as oil approaches $60 a barrel, and if it eclipsed $60 a barrel, you'll start to see more economic activity in that business. But part of that is it gets caught up in what Chris was talking about before, where if activity picks up there then you'll see corporate transient pickup, and you might see that could be a factor that causes us to get a little bit more positive about corporate transient.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. And the oil and gas getting back into heavy production mode is on a lag.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Right.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I mean, once it gets to, breaks the $60 barrel, some of it can start pretty quickly, but it takes more investment and there is a lag effect.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Right. So that wouldn't be a lot of that \u2013 there wouldn't be a lot of that baked in.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","There's not a lot of that baked into our guidance for this year. The benefit of very much easier comps is obviously baked in.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up, just because we're a couple of weeks after the ALIS Conference. Chris, was there any dramatic, I guess, difference in terms of what you're expecting your partners and REIT owners in terms of how they were viewing the world after you had conversations with them and how they view 2017 versus maybe how you and some of the C-corps view it?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No. I think not to be too short on the answer, I didn't see any real difference in our view and their view. I think the broader view coming out of ALIS, I think was, I would describe \u2013 probably it's used too frequently but, cautious optimism. There's still a lot of \u2013 as I said, a lot of things in play, but I think most of the folks I talked to in our ownership community, and I talked to a ton of them there, and I talk to a ton of them on a regular basis, our feeling, I think broadly in the industry with our owner community and the REIT community are feeling a little bit better about 2017 than they did a few months ago. And as I said, I think time will tell, but my general sense is a bit more optimism.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead with your question.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Chris, I wanted to focus on the longer-term picture. Now that you've separated from the two other businesses, are there \u2013 or what are the \u2013 and any new strategies or enhancements to existing strategies that you're now able to pursue to drive shareholder value over the next three to five years, it's very broad question, but if you want to take an opportunity to really focus on the primary drivers? And then fold into that your thoughts on, how the relationship might work with HNA once that closes?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure. The first one, I don't know with the limits of time, I should be careful, because I am longwinded as everybody knows. But I would say, there is no real change in our strategy for the core business. I think having spun the other two businesses, it changes the nature of the business from the standpoint of how the investment community would look at it, it certainly changes the beta of the business in the sense that now, the remaining business is really the fee business, that's a much more resilient business with embedded growth as a consequence of the pipeline that we have and that is growing.","So our strategy had been and continues to be to make sure that we have the best brand portfolio in the business that as we add brands that we do it in a sensible way to better serve our customers that we drive terrific commercial performance across new and existing brands in a way that drives premium market share, and that that premium market share is ultimately driving a disproportionate share of the investment capital to our brands from the ownership community because they are going to make more money dealing with us. And that disproportionate investment from the ownership community is ultimately going to drive unit growth and bottom-line growth. And we know in the new world order of New Hilton that \u2013 while obviously the higher same-store growth is the better it is for us, the new unit growth is a much more significant component and contributor to our overall growth.","And so, we had been focused in that way, and I think trying to do our best to optimize that opportunity, we will continue to focus on that, again making sure that our existing brands maintain their relevance and gain relevance, gain market share, that new brands that we launch organically are relevant to what customers needs, and ultimately all of our brands drive performance for owners. And if we do that, I think you're going to see our market share continue to grow, and I think you're going to continue to see us take share globally on the development side, and that's going to deliver a fabulous result over time. When paired with now new part of the strategy, a different return of capital story, which is in a world where we had other businesses that were much more capital intensive and a lot of our capital was going towards that or deleveraging, we did not have the kind of capital available that we do today to return to shareholders.","So when you take the fundamental business that's performing I think exceptionally well and if we do our job, it'll only get better from a growth point of view. You match it with now very little and capital needs and very significant free cash flow and a very disciplined approach from myself and the rest of our team to returning that capital over time, I think it drives a fabulous result.","As a result of having spun the companies in addition to having a cleaner more resilient lower beta model with more free cash flow, it obviously frees management up, not that we weren't focused on this, but it frees us up to double down on everything we're doing with our brands, everything that we're doing with Honors and loyalty, some of the things you saw just recently allows us to double down on what we're doing with innovation to continue to make sure that everything we do is through the eyes of the customer and making sure that that we are ultimately driving more loyalty, more relevance with our customers and as a consequence, more share and more growth.","So, we've been focused on those things, that's not to remember \u2013 obviously going without saying without having those two businesses, it just gives those of us and senior management even more time to focus on those things and do it even better and I think propel growth at an even faster rate going forward.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","And HNA?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","And HNA, which we do expect to close before the first quarter is out. We've had discussions with them, nothing is different really than the commentary I made on the last call. The discussions with them really center around how do we connect our respective travel asset, so loyalty, they have a very large loyalty program, we think there are tremendous opportunities to connect their folks with ours and ours with theirs. They are also quite active in the travel agency, both online and traditional through their tour business in China and with customers leaving China and getting very connected with them in both those regards. So though, as they close the deal at the end of the quarter and we continue those discussions, I think as the year plays out, we'll have some tremendous opportunities that connect those assets in a way that helps us and frankly, I think helps them as well, which is obviously in part why they were interested in us.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Thanks very much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Chris, I think there were two drivers this cycle that kind of set it apart from other cycles from a demand perspective. One is inbound international travel, and I think we've talked about that, FX, whatnot. But the other one is kind of the millennials proclivity to travel. And I guess my question is, is there any sort of fatigue \u2013 travel fatigue you're seeing from the millennials, any change of habits from a travel perspective?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Not really. I mean, Bill, we spend a lot of time thinking about millennials and young people and young customers, and I have to say, it is certainly no trend that I have seen, if you look at our leisure business overall throughout, even the downturn, but coming out of the downturn, into this now fairly long up-cycle, it's been pretty consistently a leading positive indicator in the sense of growth has been at a strong clip, sort of leading the charge and has stayed that way.","And a component of it and an increasing component of it is the millennial traveler, who I think really wants to get out with the \u2013 and experiencing. Now, I would probably say, when we wake up in a decade that's going to be over half our traveling population, if you look at it today, it's probably 20%, 25% of our population are travelers. That's one of the reasons we've been doing \u2013 in terms of our brand launches, we've been doing some of the things we've been doing, if you think about Home2 first, then Tru, now Tapestry, a lot of that, not all of it, we want to obviously appeal to a broad range of customers with all our brands, but those brands, particularly at the price points that they're at, which is at the lower end, is going to allow us we think to get younger travelers into the system and build loyalty with them. So as they grow up and they travel more in different ways they stick with us. Because the fact is, some of our products even at the lower end were at a price point that it was very difficult for certainly the younger end of millennials to stay with us.","So I think the millennial travelers is alive and well, I think that certainly the trends we see is a \u2013 as a proportion of their disposable income, all the stats we can find are that they more than most generations like to use it on experiences, and thankfully travel is one of those experiences that they like to use it on.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, Chris that leads me into the follow-up question, which is the Stop Clicking Around campaign. If you could give us any details on how you're gauging the success of that, and the impact positive or negative to the company and to the owners? Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Great question. I mean, we gave you some of the stats that I think matter the most. So we're about a year \u2013 not quite a year from anniversary from the beginning of that campaign. And if you look at some of the stats that we disclosed earlier about 9 million new Honors member, and that number is higher now because we have more members this year, so probably over 10 million new Honors members. You look at Honors occupancy up nearly 400 basis points. And I think most important statistic is over 200 basis points in channel shift, I would say, leading to our direct low cost online channels either web-direct or mobile, that suggest to me, well this is early days and while the Stop Clicking Around campaign is done, you're going to see us to do all sorts of other things, including what you just saw with Honors to continue to build direct relationships. I would say, it's been quite successful.","In the end, what our job is, is to drive profitability for owners and that means top line, but also bottom line and distribution cost is not an insignificant component of their cost structure. So if I look at the channel shift that that has occurred and we look at, what's happening from a net rate point of view across all our channels, I think in the end, our owners \u2013 I can't say every single owner in every single circumstance that it's worked perfectly, but I would say across the system, it has worked really well.","We have shifted, we've obviously maintained growth and market share and shifted by a couple hundred plus basis points business to channels that drive better net revenue for our owners. So as I talk to our owners, again I could not find an exception to anything, but broadly, we just had a joint OAC meeting with a 100-plus of our most important largest owners in LA, as part of ALIS. They all seem very, very happy with what we're doing and continuing to try and build direct relationships with our customers.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Just had a quick question on the trajectory of brand launches, we've had a handful of new launches in the last two years, and I know there is still some white space remaining. But what should the trajectory of those new brand launches look like? And then, secondarily, when can these new brands start to become a material piece of that 55,000 rooms that you add each year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yes. Well, we do these things in a \u2013 hopefully, we make it look easy when we do them, but it's not easy, because not only do we have to figure out with our customers ultimately what resonates with them, but we then have to commercially make sure it's successful, because if we go out and launch something that doesn't really work for owners, then they are not going to invest the capital. So we try and give each of these a proper birth.","And they all sort of go through a process, we obviously had great success last year with Tru, but we're really still \u2013 we haven't even opened our first Tru. So we're very focused on making sure that works commercially. Tapestry, which is a bit easier, because these are largely conversion hotels, existing hotels, it's plugging it into our engines, which again, I make sound easy, my team is wincing probably all over the world, it's not easy, but it's easier than starting from scratch. So we were able to move Tapestry along a little bit faster.","And we need to get that under our belt and get some momentum on the develop \u2013 we have momentum, we need to get more momentum, we need to get some opened. We have four other concepts that I think we described them all very briefly, but nonetheless, described them at the Analyst Day in December, that we're developing. I think, eventually we'll do them all. And the cadence is likely, maybe one more in the soft brand area that we could do this year, because again more conversion, a little bit easier, in terms of incubating it here. The others, I think, will take a little bit longer, because they're more complicated and we're going to want to give what we've done a chance to gain some momentum.","In terms of when, if you look at, what we've already done, what's sort of in the supply and in the pipeline is, we've already got 90,000 rooms out of the brands, including Home2, that we've launched over the last half a decade. So, I think these things can ramp up quickly. We have 400 deals in Tru alone, I think by the end of last year, we had 16,000, 18,000 rooms technically in the pipeline, 37,000 with what's in progress, so the rest of those will go in the pipeline. So Tru alone will probably have 30,000 or 40,000 rooms in the pipeline in the not too distant future. And those things are relatively easier to finance and smaller bites given the size of the deals, those things will start to have \u2013 the Tru's will start to have much more quickly. So, I think there are \u2013 I think our new brands are already contributing significantly to the pipeline, and in the case of Home2 particularly with the existing stock, but you'll start to see these things really contribute in terms of its existing supply in a much more meaningful way over the next two and three years.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co.

Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on both our results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019re pleased to report another strong quarter with top-line growth above the mid-point of our guidance and adjusted EBITDA above the high-end of our guidance. Healthy fundamentals should continue to drive solid performance for the rest of the year and in the next, which we\u2019ll cover in a little bit more detail shortly.","In the quarter, system-wide comp RevPAR [Audio Gap] currency neutral basis. Transient growth was the primary driver of RevPAR growth in the quarter as the expected holiday shifts impacted group demand. System-wide transient growth was up 6% in the quarter, strengthening significantly in September and with particular strength in leisure, which was up almost 10% in the quarter. System-wide group revenue increased nearly 4% in the quarter with strength in New York, Orlando and Los Angeles. Group revenue was strong in July with over 8% growth, but was tempered by the effect of calendar shifts in August and September. Americas owned and operated expected group revenue is up over 500 basis points in Q4 versus Q3 actuals and strengthening in pace.","On top of strong top-line performance in the quarter and great cost discipline, both corporately and in the hotels that drove strong margin growth, we continue to benefit from significant and accelerating net unit growth.","Our leading brands that can serve nearly every lodging needs guests have anywhere in the world they want to be, drive loyalty to our system and result in our industry leading market share premiums. Better top-line results drive better returns for our hotel owners and they in turn choose our brand.","In the quarter, our net unit growth was nearly 13,000 rooms on openings of 91 hotels and more than 14,000 gross rooms. Our net unit growth of nearly 30,000 rooms through September is more than 12% ahead of last year and we\u2019re on track to meet our 2015 guidance of 40,000 to 45,000 rooms.","We\u2019re also on track to improve a record total of nearly 100,000 rooms this year, continuing to grow the largest hotel system in the world with the largest pipeline in the industry as measured by star. We continue to get a disproportionate share of new development with our portfolio brands accounting for one out of every five rooms under construction in the world. That\u2019s four times our existing share of global rooms and we remain number one in rooms under construction globally.","Our goal is to win everywhere. And having a diverse portfolio of brands enables growth as markets have inflow. And China for example, we expect to sign more deals this year than last, because we strategically deployed focused-service brands there over the past couple of years and these brands are now ramping up as full service and luxury development slowed. Our China pipeline now contains 31 Hilton Garden Inns and 13 Hamptons. The first of hundreds of focused-service hotels, we expect to open in China by the end of the decade. We expect the pace of openings in China to increase as more focused-service hotels enter the pipeline with a typical time to build less than half of full-service and luxury projects.","While full service and luxury development is slowed, we still see great long-term growth potential in these segments. In fact, we expect to open nearly 20 of these hotels this year with an additional 125 projects in the pipeline. It\u2019s worth noting that nearly 30% of our gross openings year-to-date were through conversions, largely to our DoubleTree and Curio brands that grow our system but do not add to overall lodging supply. These conversions average less than one year, in our pipeline before opening and the average has been decreasing as a Curio can convert to our system in a matter of months.","Our net unit growth is driven by what we believe is the best brand portfolio in the business. Every one of our brands has a growing pipeline and over half the pipeline of rooms are under construction. We have also organically launched three brands in the past few years to address incremental market segments and further our network effect. Home2, Canopy and Curio now account for over 420 hotels and nearly 55,000 rooms either open or in development.","Earlier this month at the Lodging Conference held at the Arizona Biltmore, we begin introducing our new mid-scale brand to owners. The response was extraordinary. We expect to formally launch the brand early next year with a large number of signed deals and believe this could be our largest brand by number of hotels over time as it serves the largest segment of customer demand.","All of our new brands are driving incremental fee growth at essentially a 100% margin. And this has been achieved with no acquisitions and essentially no capital investment on our part. We believe that the scale of our high return organic brand growth leads the industry.","Now, let me take a minute to update you on our view of the cycle and our outlook for the rest of this year and in the next.","In the U.S. which drives nearly 80% of our earnings, we expect continuing strong fundamentals driven by moderate demand growth coupled with historically low supply growth. With that said up, until that supply demand balance meaningfully changes, we should continue to deliver a mid single-digit RevPAR growth, consistent with the cycle today.","Supply growth is forecasted to be half of the 30-year average this year and only modestly growing next. There is good visibility into new capacity with years of lead time. And annual estimates on supply growth during this cycle have tended to be higher than what was actually delivered.","Overall development continues to be largely driven by economically rational projects in markets that can support the room growth. We get a number of questions about Airbnb\u2019s potential impact on supply, so I thought I\u2019d give you a sense of how we view it. As you would expect, we\u2019ve done a lot of thinking and work on the topic including having commissioned some independent analyses. The bottom-line is we believe that a large portion of Airbnb\u2019s demand is incremental. The bulk of the demand is in higher rated, high occupancy urban markets; it is longer length of stay with a predominantly leisure and value focus and stay occasions where customers are willing to accept inconsistent product with very limited services.","We do not believe there is a material impact on the bulk of our markets or with our core business and leisure customers. As we speak to our largest corporate clients, we are confident that Airbnb will not satisfy a meaningful piece of their demand. We\u2019ll obviously maintain a watchful eye on Airbnb as time goes on.","Now back to the fundamentals. On the demand side, there is a very high correlation between lodging demand and macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP growth and non-residential fixed investment, both of which are forecasted to modestly increase next year. So, a steady and intact business cycle bodes well for us. Specifically for the fourth quarter, we expect 4% to 6% system-wide RevPAR growth.","In the U.S. for the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR growth to be consistent to modestly better than the past couple of quarters, driven by consistent transient demand and improving group trends. Outside the U.S., we expect fourth quarter RevPAR growth to be meaningfully lower than last couple of quarters, in large part driven by the EMEA region after a third quarter that benefited from a tremendous summer season in Europe and a favorable holiday calendar in the Middle East.","Overall, system-wide trends for the fourth quarter are a bit lower than we had anticipated due to the difficult comps in EMEA that I just discussed and U.S. transient growth in October that has not accelerated as we anticipated against a difficult year-over-year comp. For the full year 2015, given results to-date and our fourth quarter outlook, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth between 5% to 6.5%. We\u2019re raising our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million at the midpoint to $2.84 billion to $2.87 billion.","Looking ahead to 2016, our guidance reflects our view of continued strong fundamentals and it\u2019s supported by a group position that continues to track up in the mid single digits with a strengthening pace of transient growth consistent with current trends. As a result, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase 4% to 6% in 2016 with 75% to 85% of that\u2019s being driven by rate.","We believe that RevPAR growth will be led by the Asia Pacific region and the U.S., both of which should be above the mid-point. We expect RevPAR growth in Europe near the mid-point and Middle East, Africa region below the mid-point. We also think that our strong development pipeline will support unit growth acceleration in 2016, translating into global net rooms growth of 45,000 to 50,000 rooms. Lastly, we continue to work diligently on potential strategic alternatives for our timeshare and real estate businesses. We\u2019ve made great progress assessing these complex opportunities and our hoping to be in a position to update you all when we report our year-end results.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin for further details on the quarterly results and our outlook. Kevin?","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. During the quarter, our RevPAR growth of 5.8% was driven by a 4.2% increase in average rate and a 1.2 percentage point increase in occupancy to nearly 80%. In actual dollar, system-wide RevPAR per increased 3.3%. RevPAR growth year-to-date through September is 5.9%, roughly two-thirds driven by rate.","Diluted earnings per share adjusting for special items was $0.23, an increase of 28% versus the prior year period and at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA was $758 million for the quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year, beating the high end of our guidance by approximately $8 million. Fee growth and timeshare outperformed expectations with the majority of the timeshare being timing driven which should normalize in Q4.","For the quarter, enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA margins were up 290 basis points year-over-year to 41.4%, driven by lower than expected corporate and other and fee revenue. Management and franchise fees were $438 million in the quarter, up 14% over the third quarter of 2014, driven by strong franchise fees, new unit growth and franchise sales. As noted last quarter, we expect fee growth in the fourth quarter to moderate owing to accelerated timing of fees booked earlier in the year than we initially anticipated and some one-time items that benefited prior year results. However, solid comparable fee growth, outsized organic net unit growth and rising royalty rates continue to provide a healthy setup for future fee growth. And as a result, we are increasing our 2015 management franchise fee growth guidance to between 12% and 14%, an increase of 1 percentage point at the midpoint.","In the ownership segment, RevPAR grew 6% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA was $281 million, up approximately 10% versus the prior year adjusted for the sale of Hilton Sydney. Results were boosted by better performance in our international portfolio, particularly our UK hotels and lower utility prices which supported segment margin expansion of nearly 190 basis points, again adjusting for the Hilton Sydney sales.","Adjusted EBITDA was adversely affected by soft group demand related to holiday shifts. Hawaii was further affected by weaker transient business from Japan although strong group position benefited one of our larger properties. Chicago had lower occupancy due to fewer citywides. And renovations at the Moscone Center were somewhat of headwind in San Francisco.","Timeshare segment revenues increased 13% in the quarter as a result of continued growth in our capital light timeshare sales and favorable resort operations. Overall timeshare sales volume was up 19% in the quarter, driven by tour flow increases of nearly 12% and VPG increases of over 6%. Adjusted EBITDA was $99 million in the quarter, growing 24% versus the prior year period. This exceeded our expectations by about $8 million which as I mentioned earlier was largely driven by timing. We continue to expect strong tour flow and VPG growth and maintain our timeshare adjusted EBITDA forecast of $335 million to $350 million for full year 2015.","Finally, our corporate expense and other was $60 million for the quarter, slightly better than expectations. And as a result, we now expect growth in that segment to be flat to moderately down year-over-year.","Moving on to our regional results. In the U.S. RevPAR grew 5.1% year-over-year at comparable system-wide hotels, up slightly from 5.0% in Q2. Performance is driven by strong results in July with transient and group revenue, both up in the high single digits. As we anticipated, growth in August and September was tempered by softer group business, largely attributable to holiday shifts and difficult year-over-year comps. International inbound revenue declined 1.7% during the quarter, owing primarily to weaker demand from Canada, Japan and Brazil but mitigated by increases from China, Spain and the U.K.","Year-to-date revenue from international inbound travel to the U.S. is up 40 basis points versus prior year while overall room nights are down 2.9%. In the Americas outside the U.S., RevPAR grew 7.5%, driven largely by strength in Mexico and somewhat hindered by softness in Brazil where performance struggled due to economic weakness and was exacerbated by tough year-over-year comps as we lapped the 2014 World Cup. We expect Brazil to remain soft but then positive momentum across other countries should continue supporting mid-single digit RevPAR growth for the full year.","RevPAR growth in Europe increased 8.8% in the quarter driven by three consecutive months of robust growth in the region and continued market share gains, with our RevPAR index in Europe up 1.2 points for the quarter. Improving fundamentals were supported by a record breaking summer in Continental Europe which benefited from tremendous leisure transient business.","U.S. travel to Continental Europe increased 14% year-to-date. Results were modestly tempered by softer group volumes, given difficult 2014 comps from events such as the Commonwealth Games and The Ryder Cup.","While challenges in eastern Europe particularly Russia continue to pressure regional performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver solid results given increased inbound travel and local demand, coupled with rising market share. We maintain our mid-single digit RevPAR growth forecast for 2015.","In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR grew a strong 9.1% due to continued recovery in Egypt which posted its strongest quarter since 2010. Additionally, Saudi Arabia benefited from stronger group performance owing to favorable calendar shifts in Ramadan and the Hajj which will in turn weigh on fourth quarter results. We anticipate low single digit RevPAR growth forecast for the year.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased a robust 10.2% versus prior year, driven largely by a 23.9% gain in Japan as the country continued to benefit from increased local demand and influx for Mainland China and strong transient rates. Additionally, easy comparisons aided performance in Thailand. Strong corporate transient leisure volumes coupled with market share gains supported 7.6% RevPAR growth in Mainland China.","We expect transient China to remain favorable in spite of broader economy deceleration. We think increased outbound demand from the UK and U.S. combined with our market mix and market share gains, position us to continue delivering solid growth. Our RevPAR growth forecast for China remains 6% to 8% and we maintain our high single digit growth expectations for the Asia Pacific region.","Turning to capital allocation, we reduced long term debt by $350 million during the quarter with a subsequent payment of a $100 million in October, bringing total debt reduction year to date to $850 million. We ended the quarter with a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.4 times. We paid our first quarterly dividend in September and expect to maintain a target payout ratio of 30% to 40% of recurring cash flow.","We are on track to achieve a low grade investment credit profile by the second or third quarter of next year, at which point we would likely commence programmatic share buybacks.","In terms of our outlook for the full year, as Chris mentioned, we are narrowing system-wide RevPAR growth guidance to between 5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $10 million at the mid-point to $2.84 billion to $2.87 billion. Our full year guidance continues to assume approximately $60 million related to FX impacts for the year.","For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 4% and 6% on a comp currency neutral basis, adjusted EBITDA of between $706 million and $736 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.21 to $0.23. Further detail on our third quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We\u2019d now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sally, can we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instruction] And your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Shaun Kelley","Chris, thank you for the detailed kind of overview in the prepared remarks. One thing that I think is on people\u2019s mind is sort of what you are seeing so far into the 4Q. And you talked a little bit about, little bit softer transient growth in October than maybe you had expected. So, I was curious, I think coming into the quarter most investors expected that 4Q is going to better than 3Q. If you could just elaborate a little on sort of what you are seeing in the business right now, I think that would be helpful.","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I assume somebody or many people would ask that question because it\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind. And we\u2019ve obviously spent a lot time looking at what\u2019s going on in the results. Focusing on the U.S. for the moment which my guess is what you are more focused on in your question. I think what we are seeing is generally consistent with what we would have expected with exception. The group side in the fourth quarter is getting better as we expected. The transient side of business is generally tracking consistent with what we saw over the last quarters, as I said in the prepaid comments. And when you put those two together, that\u2019s how you get a U.S. fourth quarter that we said will be sort of similar to modestly better than what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters.","I will say we had anticipated, forecasted, maybe hoped for a transient pace that would pick up in the fourth quarter and particularly in October which is a very big transient month. And that has not materialized the way we had thought. Now I\u2019m not one who likes to sort of give you their 50 excuses or reasons why. When we look at it and we\u2019re sort of still trying to understand everything in a great amount of detail, it seems like it\u2019s a few things that\u2019s going on in October, one you are in a month we have very high levels of occupancy, in the low 80s. So that is an issue. The comps over last year where you had high single digit transient growth last year. So, you put those two things together, it makes it hard to sort of expect a lot. And so in part maybe we were a bit aggressive in our views of pickup in transient business in October. What\u2019s really happening as I said is it\u2019s stable, it\u2019s not -- it hasn\u2019t really ticked down, it hasn\u2019t kicked up; it\u2019s been relatively stable.","The other thing that\u2019s going on and it\u2019s hard to perfectly scientifically quantify it as we had two hurricanes. And I know everybody sort of gets tired of weather. But weather has an impact. And we had two hurricanes that ended up net-net on the East Coast and other parts of the country, cancelling thousands of flights, so people couldn\u2019t get places. We do think that in October in transient that there was some impact in that regard. And I would say in the corporate business which is what we expected to pick up, it has been a little bit choppier than we expected, meaning the net result is about where we\u2019ve been. There have been weeks that have been better and worse, so a little bit choppier.","So, it\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff. I guess the primary theme that I would sort of glean from all that I would suggest as what we\u2019ve gleaned from it all is that what we\u2019re really seeing in the fourth quarter is strengthening of group the way you expected, particularly in October in transient that is clicking along pretty much like the second quarter and third quarter. And those things are combining to drive a reasonably good result sort of where we\u2019ve been or a little bit better in the U.S. The rest of the world which is why the fourth quarter number is four to six is really a comp exercise, particularly off of third quarter you had massive leisure season in Europe with Europe on sale. In the Middle East, you had the HOD [ph] shift from fourth quarter last year to third quarter. When you put those two things together, RevPAR growth in the rest of the world which is just fine for the year and it will be fine next year and everything is good, it\u2019s just a comp issue, will be less than half of what it is was in Q3.","So, you put together, a stable to modestly better U.S. story with the comp issues and the rest of the world and that\u2019s sort of how you get there. But we\u2019re -- thing are developing, as I said, pretty much to where we thought with the exception of not seeing the pickup in transient demand in October that we forecasted.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Carlo Santarelli","I had two questions. One, Chris, if you won\u2019t mind sharing kind of how your view around some of the strategic initiatives you\u2019ve previously spoken about has changed? And secondly, if I could ask, as it pertains to your outlook, how much of the change and maybe the tone around 2016 and beyond stems from what you\u2019re seeing in your business today versus maybe what you are seeing in hearing from commentary of complementary peer industries?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, happy to cover both. On the strategic initiatives, I covered it, albeit briefly, in my prepared comments and not to repeat it. We are making really good progress. It is -- they are massively complex sort of options that we\u2019re thinking through and with lots of different moving parts. And I would say we don\u2019t really think about it any differently than any prior commentary that I\u2019ve made. But we\u2019re not in a position to really get into it at any level of detail at this point until we finish the process. And that\u2019s because honestly I think it\u2019s just unfair to piecemeal it and can talk about one element of it without talking about all elements of it. So, we\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s maybe taking us honestly a little bit longer. But as you can imagine, there are lots of things going on that impact it. And we\u2019re I think rapidly getting there and will be in a position to lay it all out for you guys, whatever it is that we think makes sense and it\u2019s not too far out.","And in terms of 2016 guidance, I\u2019m glad you asked it because you may or may not like the answer. We obviously look at our performance on a forward looking basis in a very granular way; we go through a very detailed budget by property and aggregate that all together to determine where we think we are going to be in the world. And we are not quite complete but we are very-very close to complete. And I think, we\u2019re not going to share that budget, obviously we never do. But I think it would be supportive of what I suggested in my commentary, which is we\u2019re still in a very healthy part of the cycle where we have moderate demand growth matched with very limited capacity additions. And we\u2019re going to drive I think very healthy RevPAR growth. So the underpinning of that is that we feel good about things. We think that the transient trends we see here and now that I just described, supported our group position in the next year in the mid single digits, supports it. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019ve sort of determined.","You can imagine our budgets are likely more at the higher end than anywhere else but we\u2019re always -- you don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t ask for at the property level and we\u2019re always pushing. There is a level and I will be perfectly honest than not, in a sense not perfectly scientific, there is sort of a overlay of a bit of conservatism that we\u2019ve put in our guidance that we just described, that Kevin and I just described to you. And that is just because we are out there, we\u2019re talking to all of you, we\u2019re talking to -- I\u2019m talking to lot of contemporaries and lots of different industries, we read the papers, watch the news. And I think vis-\u00e0-vis the summary then the macroeconomic risk profile has gone up a little bit, right? I mean, we\u2019re very optimistic, you know that; you heard my description of what we think we can deliver and we\u2019re going to good healthy part of the cycle. But there are more I think a little bit higher level of macro risks than might have existed three, four or five, six months ago. And so we have definitely sort of put an overlay -- a bit of an overlay of conservatism into our guidance to take that into account.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.","Robin Farley","Just looking at the guidance you gave by region, it sounded like each region was essentially unchanged in your guidance but the overall guidance came down. Should we just think about it being lower in the range and I don\u2019t know of this transient comment, is that mostly the U.S. issue or is that something that you\u2019re seeing in those other regions as well? And then maybe just as a quick follow-up and maybe this one is for Kevin. Your full year EPS guidance was unchanged at the midpoint but your EBITDA went up at the midpoint. I guess maybe some color about why we\u2019re not seeing more flow-through from that because I don\u2019t think your corporate expense is any higher, so some color\u2026","Chris Nassetta","I\u2019ll take the firstly, leave Kevin the second. In terms of our guidance, I mean I was trying to really give you a super high level trajectory on by the region. So I don\u2019t think your math is necessarily wrong. And I think my last answer probably is the right answer, which is what we try to do is look at what we think we\u2019ll have by property, by region and then we have -- there is an overlay of a bit of conservatism.","Robin Farley","Is it more that the U.S. -- if we think about your guidance, moving within the range unchanged but where within the range it\u2019s moved; is that more\u2026","Chris Nassetta","I would say Robin, to be honest; it\u2019s sort of across the board probably. Our conservatism is there are a lot of things going on in the world; I think the risk profile in the world is a little bit higher than it was. So, assume it\u2019s sort of a general risk overlay of conservatism, not specific to U.S., obviously U.S. is a big part of the business. So, by the very nature of that overlay be predominantly U.S. overlay.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great, thanks.","Kevin Jacobs","And then Robin, the full year EPS is just in -- the outlook there is in incremental penny of FX translation in there that just kept us from moving the range up.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","Joe Greff","Chris, not to beat the dead horse here about the transient commentary in October but it sounded like it was a pretty broad statement for the U.S. But can you talk about what markets where maybe things were not as bad or can you just talk about whether it was -- how market specific or how chain scale segment specific the trends that you\u2019re seeing so far in October?","Chris Nassetta","I will maybe give it to Kevin by market but I would say, it was -- we had expected broadly an increase in transient. Again, we may have been wrong in expecting that given the high occupancy months that we are in and the comps but we expected it broadly. And I would say the trends have been -- every market is a little different but the trends have generally been consistent.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, I think that\u2019s right. They have been pretty consistent. Obviously, Joe, every market has its own story but the larger markets with larger hotels tend to have a bigger impact for us overall but I think they\u2019ve been generally pretty consistent.","Joe Greff","And can you talk about your outlook for corporate negotiated rates as we\u2019re in the midst of that negotiation, what your expectations are broadly?","Chris Nassetta","I think, I just was with our team that is in the middle of those negotiations in the last week, and I think we\u2019re solidly in the mid single digits, maybe mid single digits plus.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis","First question is if in October you\u2019re seeing record occupancy, what\u2019s keeping your property managers from pushing rate more?","Chris Nassetta","I think we are trying to push rate. And think as you will probably end up seeing in October that most of the RevPAR growth is going to be raised. So, we are having some success market by market but I think you will see the lion share of the growth that come through rate. Because there is just not that much more occupancy to get particularly during the week. So, should be all rate. And I think we can always do better. I think we\u2019ve been having reasonable success there.","Harry Curtis","And second is turning to Airbnb, I think that Airbnb is working hard at addressing some of their weaknesses related to appealing to the corporate travel. How likely in your view is it that they will be able to overcome some of the more obvious issues of -- for example duty of care and the lack of the amenities?","Chris Nassetta","I think it\u2019s relatively impossible. I mean the way I think about Airbnb is it\u2019s really as I describe sort of largely urban -- high rated urban markets where -- and where their business drives, where there is an enough capacity broadly in the market, and it is generally for more extended stay. And with the leisure -- even when it\u2019s business that has sort of a leisure component, bring your family or part business, part leisure. And I view that as an evolving segment, if you will, that is satisfying maybe some of our customers; I am sure some of our customers but a lot of incremental customers that are not our customers, needs in a way that haven\u2019t been satisfied before which is why you see a very large component of Airbnb business being incremental meaning they\u2019re creating trip occasions that wouldn\u2019t have existed otherwise.","So, I think as they sort of carve that niche, I think it becomes more of a segment undo itself. I do not believe strongly, do not believe that they are major threat to the core value proposition we have, which is consistently high quality product and service delivery. And service delivery incorporates into it a significant amenity package. Just simply because I don\u2019t think that given the segment they have curved out in the model but there is a real ability to do the things that we do. Again, it doesn\u2019t mean I think Airbnb is not a really good business and business is going to be around for long time, I think it is a good business and will be around. I just think it is serving a different kind of need; it\u2019s a different business segment onto itself. And the segments that we are serving largely I think will remain separate and distinct from that.","And I think it\u2019s very hard -- I think it\u2019s very hard for us to do exactly what they are doing. I think it\u2019s extremely hard for them to be able to do -- replicate what we are doing. And I don\u2019t think customers, suddenly woke up our core customers and said we really don\u2019t care about consistently high quality products and we don\u2019t need service and we don\u2019t need amenities. I just don\u2019t buy it. And by the way scientifically and the research that we have done and we have done an immense amount of it, that\u2019s not what customers are saying to us, quite to the contrary. They are saying they want more -- our core customers want more consistency, more quality, more service delivery, more of the amenities that they want and that they value.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff Donnelly","Two questions, actually just continuing first with Airbnb. Chris, down the road, how do you think their platform evolved? Do you think it may be strategically combines the major hotel brand and there is a reason for having a continuum of product from hotel rooms to Airbnb product, or do you see it maybe going the other way, towards more of a reservations engine like an Expedia?","Chris Nassetta","It\u2019s hard to say. You should ask those guys. I might have a view if I were running it but I am not. I don\u2019t think it becomes connected to hotel brands, I could be wrong. I don\u2019t see that. But it\u2019s possible. I mean if you believe what I just said a few minutes ago that it\u2019s sort of developing into its own segment, one of the big hotel companies could say that\u2019s a segment we want to serve and we don\u2019t serve, and we don\u2019t think it cannibalizes any of the rest of our business, which I\u2019d happen to believe is true and we want to have that segment. But I wouldn\u2019t probably view that as a high profitability. I think if you look at it, they are creating a very loyal customer base that wants to buy things through their system. So, I don\u2019t know if I had to guess, it becomes through those loyal customers, a broader platform to do other things. But again, they don\u2019t have a call I guess since they are private but they have lots of investors I guess. So, I would ask them.","I do believe that strongly as I said that there is every ability for us to coexist. I know a lot of people are spending a lot of time; we are spending a lot time on this call and for good reason by the way. I told you in my prepared comments, we\u2019ve thought about it a lot. We have done a lot of research independently and our self. So you guys should care about it. But I suspect over time investors, everybody will see it for what it is, which is a really good business but a business that is maybe not a 100% but largely distinct from what we do and that there is every opportunity for both of us to have really successful business models.","Jeff Donnelly","And then just as a follow-up, obviously there is lots of banter in the press about what\u2019s going on with Starwood or with Hyatt or the Chinese buyer. How does the threat of a potential combination between whoever, Hyatt or Chinese buyer, maybe affect your thinking on the strategic landscape? And maybe second to that can we rule out Hilton\u2019s interest there?","Chris Nassetta","Second first, you can rule out Hiltons\u2019 interest. Okay? So, to be in abundance of clarity, we are not involved in the process in any way. Secondly, and the second and why I went in that order is because it leads to the second. And the reason that we\u2019re not is we feel -- I am not going to comment on who might do what; it\u2019s not my business and I don\u2019t know other than the rumors and what I read like you. The reason we are not involved in that process and the reason I\u2019m not worried about what happens there is, we feel a very good about the setup that we have. We feel like we\u2019ve done an amazing job transforming this business over the last eight years to create a real formidable network effect with both our scale, our geographic diversity, our chain scale diversity, the strength of our individual brands, every one of which is either a category killer or leads the industry on average the highest mortgage share in the industry, having launched three new brands with an opportunity to launch more, one coming around the bend and be able to do that in a way where we\u2019re leading the industry in organic growth and driving incredibly high returns incrementally, infinite return, IRRs and a 100% margin business. We don\u2019t feel -- while we feel like there are always going to be gaps that we need to think about, they are relatively modest and those are opportunities, those are not weaknesses for us given the other attributes that we already have.","So, when we look at the world, I think we got to run the company while we can\u2019t get complacent which is what happened to our company up until eight years ago. We sort of gotten top of the hill and became complacent. We are not going to get complacent, not while I\u2019m here. We\u2019re going to stay on the balls of our feet. We have an amazing business and amazing opportunity in front of us and that\u2019s what were focused on optimizing for all of our benefit.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Bill Crow","Chris, you did a great job in the introduction talking about the fundamentals; you painted kind of a broad brush. But if we take a little finer look and we kind of get beyond national supply and demand statistics, we start looking at the bigger gateway cities. It certainly seems like there is some underperformance there that might otherwise be matched. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s international demand, Air -- hate to mention Airbnb at this point or maybe increased supply where we are hearing 2%, 3%, 4% in many of these big markets. I guess the question is what are you seeing with your pipeline, with your owned assets which are in many of these markets; what do you have to say about those kind of gateway cities?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. Honestly, you are right; every major cities got a different story. I would say broadly outside of New York, Bill, we don\u2019t see a lot of it. People have been talking about Airbnb and other things in San Francisco. We\u2019re going to be double-digit RevPAR growth this year and we think next year is going to be another really good year in San Francisco. New Orleans a great story. We\u2019re having a great year in Chicago, maybe a little bit weaker there next year than this year. Outside of New York I would say, we just don\u2019t see particularly significant issues. The way I would look at it is we\u2019ve gone through all our major markets and sort of filtered it for our business which is to say where are the markets that maybe have a little bit more than the national average of supplies and that don\u2019t -- where have a big presence or a relatively big presence and that don\u2019t have demand that is exceeding that meaning they have other things going on. And that sort of I think as we run the business, the right filter to look at because some markets are going to have excess supply, more than national average like the Seattle but the demand growth is phenomenal and so the story goes.","So, it\u2019s not just supply, it\u2019s supply against demand. And then for us, it\u2019s where do we have a presence. And when I put it through all those filters, New York is obviously sort of the one that continues to stand out. I would say probably the Texas markets, particularly Dallas and Houston because there has been a bunch -- a little bit more supply and they have demand issues, given what\u2019s going on with oil and gas. I would say beyond that, maybe a touch of Miami but demand growth coming in Latin America has been quite strong. So, there is little bit more supply growth but there is also pretty good demand growth. I think we are going to be 7% growth this year in the Miami market. Chicago, a little bit -- which is a market that depends on McCormick, I would say you could look at next year and say maybe Chicago has little bit more. It\u2019s having a great year this year. Chicago is probably having a little bit more supply than we are seeing demand growth because of the convention cycle next year coming out of McCormick. So, maybe Chicago will be sort of a little bit on that list. But that\u2019s sort of the list.","And when we look at the percentage other than New York which is 4% of our EBITDA, you go to the Texas market, it\u2019s just one or in change; Miami which I don\u2019t think is an issue is less than 1%, these are -- this is the benefit of diversification and having a very big broad portfolio that not only is sort of spread around the world but spread around the United States.","So, I\u2019m not trying to -- there is definitely -- there are some markets that have little more supply than others. I just don\u2019t think -- as we look at it through our filters, it\u2019s not wholesale by any means. There are just a few select places that we think about and where we\u2019d have a little bit more concern. But generally, I think the story across the country is quite intact.","Bill Crow","I appreciate that. Very quickly, Kevin, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about achieving a low investment grade rating midpoint in next year I think or early to mid next year. Is that -- it seems like that\u2019s pushed back a little bit from earlier expectations. Is that fair and why?","Kevin Jacobs","No, I think it\u2019s on track, Bill. I think that\u2019s where we think the credit profile will get into the zone. We\u2019d originally said three to four when we came out and we are in the fours. And then I think we said last quarter on our call that we had refined that range just in thinking with in discussions with the rating agencies and how they look at the business because they think about the business differently as you get into different portions of the cycle. So, I would say plus or minus on track.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Felicia Hendrix","Chris, going back to your outlook for group next year, I believe, if I heard this correctly, you said that it was up in the mid single digits for 2016; is that on rates or bookings, both?","Chris Nassetta","That is in both. I think the best I remember is, it\u2019s two-thirds rate 60:40 rate\u2026.","Felicia Hendrix","And then can you just take us further to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the complexion of that demand? Are you seeing different industries, industry switch and are you seeing more or less sensitivity to rates or bookings, some color F&B, just any kind of detail you can give what you\u2019re seeing?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I mean there are few things as we\u2019ve been looking at and that I think are interesting but not inconsistent with what you would think. I think in terms of the types of business, the growth is coming predominantly in corporate groups but the big association groups are coming back. So, the average size group is getting a little bit bigger, not surprisingly as you get into the group cycle coming back in a more fulsome way. The length of the booking window has extended. Actually ran stats across all size groups last week with our guides. And it\u2019s a month to a month and a half extension in the booking cycle because you\u2019re having months which are big group months like October, where we\u2019re running 83%. People get trained to think, wow, there\u2019s no capacity, so I better start booking a little further out. So, I think that\u2019s a good trend but a natural trend.","I think in terms of the spend; it depends on any quarter what\u2019s going on. But broadly I think those trends are following what we would expect. If we look at owned and operated hotels this year and what kind of food and beverage catering growth we\u2019re going to see against the RevPAR growth, it\u2019s probably 60% to 70%. Honestly we had probably hoped for it to be a little bit better, little bit more comparable and that has to do with sort of partly the third quarter calendar shifts with that impacting group in the quarter has a meaningful impact on the full year. But generally I think that spend trends are headed in the good direction. As you get the bigger groups coming back which we\u2019re seeing, in corporate groups I think you will continue to see the food and beverage spend sort of tick up naturally. So, I guess those are few things that maybe fun facts but I think again are interesting. And that\u2019s what you should expect to see as group comes back and we are.","Felicia Hendrix","That\u2019s helpful. And then switching gears, Kevin, obviously you guys are very clearly focused on driving shareholder value and I thank you all for the color in terms of just reminding us that we\u2019re going to get an update when you next report. But just thinking, how are you thinking about your strategic options given the decline in REITs and timeshare multiples?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, I think Chris said it before, Felicia, so I am probably not going to say too much more, as you can probably imagine. But we don\u2019t think about this really any differently than we thought about it before. These are long-term decisions we\u2019re making to drive shareholder value, as we mentioned. And so we\u2019re still thinking about it the same way.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Steven Kent","Just a couple of questions. You mentioned earlier that your timeshare sales were little bit better in the quarter based on timing, and I just wanted to understand little bit of what was going into that. Also just as an aside just because it\u2019s interesting, because a lot of your growth is coming in Asia, you announced the partnership with Plateno to build 400 Hampton Inns in China over the next few years. You did that back in October 2014 and now Plateno has been acquired. So, does this change your ability to grow into that market? And then just one final question, because I just think it\u2019s interesting. Occupancy is at very, very high levels right now. And as you noted, it\u2019s been a little bit hard to push rate. Is there anything, Chris or Kevin, you can change structurally that makes it harder to push rate higher when the inelasticity is pretty high?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I\u2019ll maybe take the second and third and let Kevin take the timeshare one, and in reverse order maybe. On occupancy -- first of all, I don\u2019t believe, I said we\u2019re having a hard time; I said we can always do better is what I recall saying and that we\u2019re driving the majority of our -- in these high occupancy periods, the majority of our growth is coming in rate. So I mean I think we are achieving that. What I think it has do with, Steve, honestly more than anything is just sort of what has been, how much air is in the balloon generally from a macroeconomic point of view. And that is to say, this has been - we\u2019ve had reasonable demand growth but not sort of skyrocketing demand growth. The reason that we have been able to deliver these mid single digits RevPAR numbers because we had such a dramatic decline in capacity.","So, I think there is obviously more transparency. We had transparency for a while, maybe it\u2019s getting -- of course it\u2019s getting better but we have had pretty good transparency for a while. I think it has to do more with the fact that this recovery has been a very tepid recovery. And as a result, if you look at what\u2019s going on in corporate America, there is always -- there is not sort of a really robust feeling that exists out there that you would have had with a more robust recovery that would help you push rates even further. So, as a percentage of our overall growth, it\u2019s following a natural curve in my opinion relative to what the macro conditions are giving us. And I don\u2019t think honestly that there is any -- I think it\u2019s over thinking as to go a whole lot further than that personally, based on experience.","On the Plateno, Jin Jiang, we have obviously had a good relationship with Plateno. We have been well aware long before this became publicly -- public knowledge about they were doing with Jin Jiang. And I think our attitude is that it makes them a better, stronger partner because they become bigger, better, stronger. They remained as we do committed to the things that we\u2019re trying to do together in China with Hampton. So, I think based on everything we\u2019ve seen and talking with throughout the process of their discussion with Jin Jiang, what we see in actual production on the development side, they are ahead of all their targets. They seem unbelievably focused on achieving success in this relationship. and I have every reason to believe that based on what they\u2019ve said and what I see.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Then Steve, on a timeshare question, it\u2019s interesting, our full year outlook -- the timing difference is really not on the sales side, our full year outlook is still in the high teens for overall sales for the year. As you know from covering the business, it\u2019s really earnings recognition that can have differences in timing. So that\u2019s all it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen","Two questions on supply, the first one just around -- is there -- it\u2019s a simple question, sorry. Would it be able to \u2013 could one adjust for your geographic and maybe chain scale exposure and get a supply forecast, maybe compare it or more qualitatively, how it compared to STR\u2019s forecast? And second question, there was an interesting article on the Wall Street Journal; I think it was last week about all the soft brands and highlighting potential risk to DoubleTree. You obviously had positive comments about unit growth there; just wanted to hear your latest thinking about that potential risk. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","I think we are doing everything in reverse order. I\u2019ll take the second one and get Kevin the first. On the soft brands actually, I think if you get in detail what\u2019s going on with DoubleTree is that we have had an unbelievable success story for a whole bunch of reasons. When we got here net team eight years ago, we really viewed DoubleTree, particularly as the market started to go and decline, as a unique opportunity for growth, unique in the sense that none of the big global brands was outplaying in the space sort of below the core up or upscale space in full service, almost a bridge between limited service and full service. And our view is as if we reinvent DoubleTree from a product service point of view to sort of get into that strata, we can really drive a great customer experience but defiantly drive great market share and great unit growth, and that\u2019s exactly what happened. And thankfully our competitors gave us a very wide berth. So in that six years or whatever, we took market share from not being at fair share. We increased it I would say 700 or 800 basis points. And even taking out 10% of the system at the bottom that didn\u2019t meet the quality standards we doubled the size of the brand. And we continue to have great amazing momentum as it has been and will continue to be a great engine of growth for conversions and new builds. I mean doing plenty of new builds in other places around the world, obviously not much of any full service stuff getting done in the U.S.","We clearly -- it sounds like -- Marriott had said they bought Delta to compete with it. That\u2019s what I hear and that\u2019s what I read in read in the papers. And others are doing other things. Clearly we will have some competition. We are not afraid of competition, makes us better. We think DoubleTree has been, continues to be unique; it has a huge global pipeline that is way ahead of what anybody else is doing. And ultimately the best test is in market share. So, a lot of these upstarts ultimately at the moment don\u2019t have the value in my opinion, don\u2019t have the same value propositions to deliver for the ownership community which is a premium market share that we have been able to deliver into the DoubleTree brand. So, we think there will be more competition. It\u2019s a competitive world. We feel really good about what we will be able to do in that world.","Kevin Jacobs","And Thomas on the supply side, the short answer is we have very broad diversification, as you know, particularly in the United States, if you are talking about that. And so we tend to become pretty much an index. And so while I don\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me, I\u2019d say it really wouldn\u2019t be any different of the supply story in our markets waited for our markets and places where we would have more supply, obviously we\u2019re 20%, plus or minus 20% of the rooms under construction in the U.S. versus 10% of the installed base. So we are getting more of our fair share. But I think as Chris has said before, we are getting more of our fair share in the places where there is more demand for the product and where our brands compete quite effectively. So, I don\u2019t think the story is any different on supply for us than it is for the industry overall.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Vince Ciepiel ","First question on unit growth, as you look at signings in the quarter and the positive reception to your new midscale brand than the ramp in some of the newer products like Home2 and Homewood, what\u2019s the unit growth setup heading into next year versus the same time last year heading into \u201815?","Chris Nassetta","I think accelerating in terms of singings and in actual deliveries. We are going to sign this year as I said in our prepared comments, hopefully a 100,000 or close to a 100,000 rooms. That\u2019s the biggest I think anybody has ever done; certainly the biggest we\u2019ve done; I think it\u2019s the biggest anybody has ever done in a year in the industry. And by the way that\u2019s no midscale; that will be probably in that pipeline that will probably be zero or maybe a de minimis number. So that will incrementally add to it. And let\u2019s take a little bit of time to get that launched in and ramped. But I think given the product and the price point and the shorter gestation period, you are going to see that be productive at a fairly rapid pace. So, I think we think things are accelerating modestly off a great year this year; they are accelerating modestly into next.","Vince Ciepiel","Great, thanks. And then finally, looking at occupancy in the U.S., it looks like you are up 120 bps year-to-date which puts you at 78%. Just wondering of the higher occupancy in most of the brands I think domestically, how is that compared to your initial expectations heading into the year and maybe you can kind of comment on what you are seeing domestic group, domestic transient and maybe the impact from the inbound arrivals; how it\u2019s tracked versus that initial expectation?","Chris Nassetta","I think the short answer is it\u2019s generally consistent with expectations for the year within a minor rounding error. So, we think next year, as I described, a lot more of the growth is going to come through rates, so much more modest occupancy gains overall. There are lots of factors sort of moving it one way or another. International has obviously been from a volume point of view, a bit of a drag but there are other things that have been sort of benefitting us, most particularly the group as we\u2019ve all been waiting for that group cycle to get more in full swing. We are starting to see that. And that\u2019s a very healthy thing for the business because it not only gives us more occupancy and builds the base but it allows us ultimately to leverage off of that base to drive more rate growth which is in part why you are seeing 75% to 80% of our RevPAR growth forecasted next year to be on the rate side. So, I think it\u2019s generally consistent with what we thought and next year is consistent with what we would expect to see at this stage of the cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Joel Simkins","Chris, as you think about your ability to take price over the next year or so, how much does the kind of the airline industry is factoring to the mix? Obviously they have taken up price. And I have to imagine your corporate partners do think about kind of the total travel costs. So, does that in anyway sort of crimp your ability to kind of continue to push through a rate?","Chris Nassetta","I guess the answer would be sort of logical yes, it would at some point. I don\u2019t think the airlines are moving their rate so much that it\u2019s really -- that we\u2019re seeing any impact and will watch it carefully. But I ultimately think both of us are moving our rates because of underlying fundamentals of sort of the laws of supply and demand. They are doing what they do to limit capacity to drive prices up; we have limited capacity because not a lot of people are adding. So, if the balloon is still with air, meaning the broader economy continues to go, I think it gives us pricing power. So, I don\u2019t see based on the current trajectory of what they are doing what the economy is doing that that crimps what we think we will deliver.","Joel Simkins","And one quick follow-up here, as we think about CapEx for 2016, is it a little too early to start commenting on that or should we expect to hear any sort of detail around specific hotel projects; could you update us on with the real estate?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, we are going -- Kevin can comment, but we\u2019re going to give you obviously; now we\u2019re just giving you sort of the high level like we always do this time of year. We are not done with our budget process; we will give you that on our next call. I would say as a leading indicator because we\u2019re pretty far down the line and nothing unusual in CapEx, nothing out of the norm from what we\u2019ve got this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Your line is open. ","Smedes Rose","I just want to ask, you spoke on supply a little bit and I was just curious if you\u2019re seeing anything on the ground level on the development side, on the ability to access financing either in core U.S. markets where it does seem like there is a little bit of an uptick in supply, you mentioned Chicago and we see -- obviously there\u2019s lot coming in New York. So, core markets versus secondary markets; is one remain easier than the other; do you feel like overall developers can get development loans or maybe what do you think\u2026","Chris Nassetta","I would say, overall it\u2019s still hard. I would say, only the best developers with the best brands are getting financed. And I know that sounds like I\u2019m being partial to our brands and I am but it happens to be true. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s indiscriminate lending going on. I think it is heavily underwritten with the best of the best, both owner and brand. I would say, if you look at it statistically, more of its getting financed in secondary and tertiary markets. It\u2019s almost all limited service, okay and it remains that. You haven\u2019t seen it creep up with lots of full service or any real luxury; I mean there is spattering stuff but it\u2019s almost all limited service. If you look at the bulk of the numbers, it\u2019s in secondary and tertiary markets because for a simple reason that\u2019s where it has made the most economic sense and in part an issue that people don\u2019t talk about enough because it\u2019s hard to scientifically sort of prove it out but there is more massive obsolescence issues in those secondary and tertiary markets where what -- you may not have a hotel that\u2019s going out of supply that a Hampton or Garden Inn or a Homewood is replacing but you have hotels that are sort of past their useful life. They\u2019re going to stay open; they\u2019re not going to bulldoze them but they\u2019re going to down the scale of brands and price point.","And so in reality, they are not truly in our competitive set. That obsolescence issue is much more -- it\u2019s much more of a secondary and tertiary market issue which is why I think you see the bulk of that development going on there. There obviously a spattering of it going on in the urban markets, still mostly limited service but I think it\u2019s been on a normal path. I\u2019ve seen developers are saying the best developers with the best brands are able to selectively get money. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s been for the last six months; that\u2019s the way it is now.","Smedes Rose","And then I guess kind of a similar question on China, I think we were pleasantly surprised by your very positive commentary on China despite lowered economic expectations for that market. And I think you did mention that the luxury and the high end, maybe it\u2019s a little bit slower on the development side versus the more midscale, could you maybe just provide a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing there?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, we\u2019ve been trying to provide a little ton more color honestly but then what I said, but we\u2019ve been saying this to everybody, to you guys and everybody else that for the last two or three years and we\u2019ve been working for longer than that on sort of adapting our strategy. Because it was obvious to us few years ago that on the development side a lot of what was going on at the high-end of the business may not have been totally economically rational based on the hotel economics but was part of mass infrastructure build and huge investment going in to real estate which got a bit bubbly in China and that Chinese government has tried to manage the deflation of that real estate balloon without having it spark, a contagion in the rest of their economy. They\u2019ve done a reasonably good job of doing that honestly but in so doing they\u2019ve been reallocating capital and lending out of that space and into other things. And the market is by definition from a development point of view in the hotel space, becoming more economically rational. What\u2019s more economically rational there over the long-term just like it is in other markets as they mature like the U.S. or Europe is really the mid market opportunities, particularly in secondary and tertiary markets. So, we anticipated that. It is just obvious that this was eventually going to happen. ","China, if you draw a line to it, it\u2019s a line that goes up but it\u2019s not without ups and downs as it does its. And it was obvious long-term for us to create the same network effect that we have in other parts of world, particularly in the U.S. and Europe then we needed broad distribution and that only over the long-term economically rational things we\u2019re going to get done and those things were going to be really more in the mid-market with our limited service brands. So, we two and three years ago repositioned our products for those markets, built out relationships with owners and in the case of Hampton with Plateno, over an extended period of time and now we\u2019re getting really good traction. We think that over time like the U.S., like Europe, that will be the bulk of the growth. What we\u2019re trying also say that doesn\u2019t mean that full service and luxury isn\u2019t going to happen in China; over time that\u2019s going to be a big growth business, it\u2019s just kind of ebb and flow where I think the limited service businesses going to be more steady because of just more markets in China that are applicable.","So, it\u2019s not unlike what we did in Europe five to six years ago when a lot of people bailed out on Europe, when it had all its troubles, we said why would we bail out, what we out to do is change the trajectory and have a value strategy with conversions to DoubleTree. And then if it\u2019s going to be new-build, it\u2019s going to be a super efficient Hampton or Garden Inn type opportunity. We shifted to the strategy there and we have our pipelines twice as big as the next closest pipeline. And we\u2019ve been delivering hotels in that market at a much more rapid pace. So, the idea of being China, Europe, U.S., you got the right brands in the right segments and you are quick on your feets and you are really strategic about it, you should be able to grow all the time in good times and bad by deploying by these brands and building the right relationships with the right partners in these various parts of the world including China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Rich Hightower","A lot of ground covered today, so thanks for the commentary. One very quick question regarding buybacks. I\u2019m just curious if you can comment on any potential limitations or other sensitivities around potentially buying back Blackstone shares in addition to the ones that flow publicly?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Rich, I think that we would probably not do that. It\u2019s something that\u2019s impossible but I think it\u2019s very difficult for them to sell the company shares. But I don\u2019t think it changes the dynamic and the way we think about capital allocation and its ability to have the desired effects.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","A quick question about the business transient customer. We heard on other calls that there has been a lot of short term cancellations. Are you seeing this trend as well and are you going to look to lengthen your -- or I guess strengthen your cancellation fee to maybe lengthen them.","Chris Nassetta","On the second first and that\u2019s the trend today. Yes, we are looking at and testing a bunch of different options on lengthening and cancellation fees and the other things to address generally tying our inventory up for lengths of time without having people have to pay for it. And that\u2019s something we think is sensible. But that\u2019s for a whole bunch of reasons. It\u2019s not because we are seeing any short term cancellation activities that\u2019s outside of what we\u2019ve been seeing. Obviously with all these new technologies and things over the last couple of years, there has been lots of different sort of ways people are trying to game all our systems with cancel and rebook. And when there is no cost to it, the system has risk of gaming. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re really addressing. But in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in October or whatever, there is not nothing new or unusual. That\u2019s business as usual. We should be looking at our cancel policies and where we have fees and things just because it\u2019s the right thing to do in the new world order.","Wes Golladay","And then looking at some of these high occupancy, low ADR growth markets like New York in particular, is the inability -- we\u2019re talking about inability to push rate but is ADR just dropping because of a mix shift issue? Wondering more specifically how your corporate negotiated rates are going in New York.","Chris Nassetta","I think our corporate negotiated rates in New York are consistent with what we\u2019re seeing everywhere else. Remember that\u2019s not -- it\u2019s kind of looking at Kevin -- I think our corporate negotiated in New York is probably 20% maybe, 17% to 20% of the -- maybe less, 15% to 20% of the business. So, in that arena, I think we will achieve those kinds of rates because we are pushing our core customer generally across the country pretty hard and whether they are in New York or wherever they might be. I think the inability to drive rates in New York has had mostly to do, even though it\u2019s high occupancy, there has been a lot of -- there has been a lot of supply. And there hasn\u2019t honestly been enough rate discipline and it doesn\u2019t take many to sort of not have discipline before everybody is forced to follow. So, while it\u2019s high occupancy, there\u2019s still a lot of rooms that have been coming in that market to sort of to keep a lid on it.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. I think New York is pretty unique in that regard as a market that runs that level of occupancy and has had impacts from supply. Frankly New York has needed the capacity -- it hasn\u2019t been great for our business but it\u2019s really been a lack of compression issue\u2026","Chris Nassetta","And it\u2019s a mix, to your question embedded in it. You are right, it\u2019s a mix thing. So it\u2019s still running high occupancies even with all those rooms coming in but it\u2019s with the mix that is not ideal. Yes, you can run it; you fill it; incrementally you make more profit but if you had fewer rooms, you would have a better mix and you would have a higher paying customer and you would be able to leverage rates more. So Kevin, is right. New York is quite unique in the country.","Wes Golladay","And just a quick one on distribution. We\u2019ve seen some of the OTAs consolidate. How are you doing on your negotiations on the commissions with them and are you starting to get the customer to book more direct now and how is the mobile front going?","Chris Nassetta","We are that\u2019s a quite a good last question because it can take a while but the short version of that is we can\u2019t obviously for a whole lot of reasons -- this goes exactly what we\u2019ve done in those negotiations. I said on the last call or maybe a couple of calls ago, we had three sort of pillars in our negotiations with all our OTAs, one was that we wanted to get rid of last room availability; two, we wanted we have the opportunity to have preferential pricing to our most loyal customers; and three, we wanted to continue to move our margins down to more reasonable levels. We are now done. While I can\u2019t be specific unfortunately contractually, we are done with all of our OTA negotiations and we achieved our goals in every one of those pillars. And we are definitely seeing more activity on direct booking; we\u2019re seeing a most growth in any of our segments coming through our direct channels; and we are very focused over the next year or two and making sure that our customer understands the value preposition that we offer them to drive even more of a direct relationship in terms of booking with us.","Operator","Thank you.

Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will then review our first quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year ahead. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Jill, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We're happy to report a great start to the year. Results were better than expected with RevPAR, adjusted EBITDA and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance. Out-performance across all major segments and geographies contributed to the strong quarter and our results continued to demonstrate the strength of our simplified fee-based business model. With the solid top-line performance and a model that requires low levels of capital to grow, we continued to generate strong free cash flow, allowing us to execute on our capital return strategy.","Earlier this month, we repurchased 16.5 million shares from HNA Group in connection with their secondary offering. With this offering, they have now fully exited their investment in Hilton. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. This morning, we raised our full year capital return guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, or approximately 7% of our market cap.","Turning to results, in the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.9%, nearly 200 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. Upside was driven by U.S. and international markets, with out-performance across all three major segments: corporate transient, leisure transient, and group. Trends generally accelerated versus last quarter, boosted by improving economic growth and increasing international inbound travel to the U.S., which was up 9% in the quarter.","Group bookings, which provide some visibility into forward-looking trends, also suggest the positive momentum from the fourth quarter of last year is continuing into 2018 with new demand and improved conversions driving a 20% increase in first quarter bookings for all future periods. In the quarter, food and beverage revenue growth of roughly 6% exceeded RevPAR growth and outpaced expectations given better group business and increased spend. Booking windows continue to lengthen and group position remains up in the mid-single digits for the year.","Recent forecasts for U.S. GDP growth and non-residential fixed investment have accelerated versus prior estimates, which should provide further favorable fundamentals. Given this set up, we're raising our full year RevPAR guidance a 100 basis points to 2% to 4%, with the likely result more in the 3% to 4% range.","We are also seeing continued positive momentum with development. We ended the first quarter with 355,000 rooms in our pipeline, representing 41% of our existing base, the largest percentage in the industry. When completed, we estimate our pipeline will generate more than $700 million of stabilized, annual adjusted EBITDA. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of approximately 6.5%. With nearly 45% of estimated openings located in international markets, we expect to increase our international room supply more than 10% by year-end, led by the Asia Pacific region where we estimate portfolio growth in the high teens.","China continues to be an important driver of our success in the region. On average, we sign a new hotel in China every three days, and Hampton has the fastest growing pipeline across all international hospitality brands in the country. The market represents approximately 4% of our existing supply, but 24% of our pipeline, with a large majority already under construction.","Elsewhere in the region, we also expanded our partnerships with leading local developers. In India, we continue to grow our pipeline, which will more than double our presence in this critical market over the next few years. In the quarter, we opened the Conrad Bengaluru in India. The 285-room luxury hotel is conveniently located in the central business district and offers world-class dining options and the largest meeting and event spaces in the city.","In the Middle East and Africa region, our pipeline stands at 130 hotels, totaling approximately 34,000 rooms. During the quarter, we celebrated notable openings from Saudi Arabia to Sub-Saharan Africa to Egypt where we raised the Hilton flag over the Hilton Cairo Heliopolis and converted the hotel's luxury tower to Africa's first Waldorf Astoria. We look forward to celebrating additional openings throughout the year, including welcoming our first Hampton to the Middle East, an important milestone as we work towards our goal of tripling our footprint in the Middle East in the next several years.","Our pipeline in Europe composes nearly 200 hotels and 31,000 rooms, and we continue to identify opportunities across both new and existing brands. In the first quarter, we opened the Hilton Lake Como, marking our first property in the area and demonstrating our commitment to expanding an iconic and exciting resort destination. We also began development on our first Canopy in continental Europe, which is scheduled to open in Croatia's capital, Zagreb, later this year.","We recently welcomed our newest addition to the Canopy Brand, a little closer to home. The Canopy Washington, D.C. Bethesda North opened in March to tremendous support from the local community and exceptionally positive feedback from guests.","In U.S., more broadly, Tru and Home2 continue to lead our development story, accounting for more than a third of our expected U.S. room openings this year. In the quarter, Tru expanded its footprint to include eight more properties in six new states, with more than 500 hotels open and in various stages of development. Home2 added nearly a dozen new properties to its portfolio in the quarter for a total of 215 trading hotels and a pipeline that will double its size in just the next few years.","In the first quarter, we added more than 3 million new Honors members, up 26% year-over-year. This brings our total program to 74 million members who now drive 59% of system-wide occupancy, up 220 basis points in the quarter. We're always exploring new ways to serve our guests through enhanced technology and customer experiences. Scaling Digital Key continues to be an important part of that effort. More than 3,100 properties and 512,000 rooms, or approximately 60% of our global system, are now enabled with the technology to allow guests to open their doors using their smartphones. Our guests have unlocked 6.7 million doors using Digital Key.","We also recently rolled out customer-centric pricing in the U.S., a new pricing structure that provides added flexibility for those who want it and cost savings for those who don't. We anticipate this new pricing model will reduce the number of last minute cancellations and maximize the number of guest rooms available. Customer-centric pricing will be available at all properties globally later this summer.","Overall, we're very pleased with the strong start to the year and optimistic on the set-up going forward, as solid economic growth, combined with our industry-leading brands, robust development pipeline, and capital-light model should continue driving strong operational performance and shareholder returns.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I want to thank all of our team members for their continued hard work and dedication in making us one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, marking our third consecutive year we've been included on the list. We were also named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute, highlighting our commitment to leading with integrity.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give a little bit more details on our results in the first quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.9% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Both rate and occupancy drove performance with particularly strong demand at our international hotels. We estimate weather related benefits partially offset an 80-basis-point drag from the Easter calendar shift.","Adjusted EBITDA of $445 million also exceeded the high end of our guidance range, increasing 9% year-over-year. We estimate that roughly one-third of the beat versus the midpoint of guidance came from timing items that will reverse later in the year, with the balance primarily driven by our RevPAR outperformance. As a result, our diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items of $0.55 also exceeded expectations.","In the quarter, management and franchise fees grew 12% to $463 million, outperforming our 8% to 10% guidance range. RevPAR gains and license fee growth largely drove better than expected results. Our owned and leased portfolio performed in line with expectations, as softness at certain European properties muted the benefits of strength in Japan.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook, first quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 2.8%, boosted primarily by solid leisure and corporate transient demand. Growth also benefited from prolonged hurricane-related business. For full year 2018, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in the lower half of our 2% to 4% system-wide range. In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR grew a solid 7.3% versus the prior year, exceeding expectations given strong leisure trends across Canada. Continued hurricane-related business also aided performance in Puerto Rico. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR in the region to grow in the mid-single-digit range.","RevPAR in Europe grew 7.1% in the quarter, roughly 100 basis points higher than our expectations, driven largely by broad strength in group business and continued recovery in Turkey, but tempered by weak leisure and corporate demand in London. We expect full year 2018 RevPAR in Europe to grow in the mid-single digits. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR growth was up 5.3%, given rebounding demand in Egypt and better oil-related business in Kuwait. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be near the high end of our guidance range.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 11% in the quarter, driven by strong transient and group performance, particularly across key cities like Beijing, Hong Kong and Tokyo, as well as a ramping hotels, which we estimate contributed nearly 300 basis points to growth in the region. The shift in Chinese New Year to earlier in the quarter also boosted results. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR for the Asia Pacific region to grow in the high-single-digit range with RevPAR growth in China of 10% to 11%.","Moving to guidance, for full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.06 billion to $2.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $2.62 to $2.71. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 3% to 4%, including an 80 basis point benefit from the Easter calendar shift. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $530 million to $550 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.66 to $0.70. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate incremental share repurchases.","Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the first quarter, for a total of $47 million in dividends and more than $1.3 billion in total capital return year-to-date. As Chris mentioned, this includes our nearly $1.2 billion share repurchase from HNA. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. For 2018, we expect to return between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.","Further details on our first quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up related to your question.","Nicole, can we have our first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Chris, going back to your commentary and certainly your guidance, it seems to have \u2013 your confidence in 2018 seems to improve. And I'm just wondering if this is just a follow through from fourth quarter, when we saw some better activity, or was there something that was really tangible that you saw in both transient and group business that has driven this confidence?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Bill, good question. I think that's the $64,000 question. Probably we'll get it multiple different ways. Yeah, if you go back to our last call, I think I was reasonably optimistic there, and that was based on the fact that during the fourth quarter, we were starting to see trends that were picking up, both \u2013 you had seen leisure transient trends remain strong. While it was choppy, we were starting to see business transient trends showing signs of life in our group pace and position for the year before it started to pick up. I'd say my increasing optimism, which I think you're reading right, is based on the fact that the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter, and I would say strengthened.","So, breaking the business down into the three major components, leisure transient continue to be strong. Some of it due to the Easter shift and the like, but frankly it was incredibly strong. Business transient, we saw it pick up and stabilize at a higher level. So, while it was choppy in the fourth quarter, it was less choppy, more consistently better. And group continued both, what we're seeing, in pace and position to be strong. So, I think there what we were starting to see and hoped would solidify from fourth to first quarter, we did see. And I think there are a lot of reasons behind it. I think the key reason is what we talked about then, and what we're seeing now, is I think broader macro strength. If you look at all of the data out there, consumer confidence is at very high levels. Business confidence has been increasing and is at reasonably high levels.","In a post-tax reform world, you have more money in consumer's pockets, a lot more money in business's pockets. You have a regulatory environment that is more stable. I'd say both in tax and regulatory policy areas, people have a little bit more visibility, a little bit less uncertainty, and that's, in part, what's driving the confidence. And, as a result, you're seeing both consumers on a leisure basis and businesses on a business basis, hire more, spend more, which is driving more demand in our business. So, the question is, for how long and what trajectory it takes, it's early in the year.","So, obviously, our optimism is showing up in our increase in guidance at 2% to 4%, but really, if you listen to my comments carefully, I said 3% to 4%, which is a pretty good improvement. So, I think it's showing up there. And we're pretty optimistic that these trends that we see short of something significant that's unanticipated, will continue for a period of time.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful, Chris. And my follow-up question, hopefully it's a quick one, is that your performance in the first quarter was weaker than the U.S. overall results. And I think it is probably a weighting issue between luxury and economy within your portfolio. Correct me if I'm wrong, but does it...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yes. I will correct. I think you're wrong.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Does it change the way you think about your presence in the luxury space and maybe the resort space? Is there more urgency to increase your presence there?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Well, we've always \u2013 let me answer the first and the second. I think your assumption is right. It is weighting. If you weighted for our portfolio, we actually beat by, I think, 70 basis points. We were higher on a weighted basis, not lower. The answer to the question on do we have an urgency on increasing our presence in luxury and resorts, of course we do. We have had that urgency for the better part of the last decade and I think we're making tremendous progress both in luxury and in our resort portfolio. But that's an effort that will continue for many, many years to come. Recognizing that quarter to quarter and year to year, by the way, all of the data-shifts has between segments, sometimes the high end is driving it, sometimes it is not. But the reason that we have a very heavy focus on luxury and resorts is just longer term, from the standpoint of having aspirational products in our system for Honors members. We think that it's beneficial. We're in a really good place now. We're open and in the pipeline between Waldorf and Conrad, we have 100 properties and representing almost every major urban and resort destination we want to be in. There are a few gaps that we've been working on. But we have made, I think, tremendous progress in those areas over the last bunch of years.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. I appreciate the time.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Dobson of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey, good morning. It's Harry Curtis. Some technical issues here.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hey, Brian.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Yeah, hey Brian. Chris, could you maybe a little bit of more color on Bill's question. As you talk to the CEOs of your customers, what are they saying about how they've loosened their travel budgets? And have you \u2013 and they seen \u2013 you've seen several cycles. So, how does this differ versus ones that you've seen over the last 20 years?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I'll take it in that order. Definitely, and I've been talking with a lot of our customers lately, just because we've had a bunch of different customer events, large and small, and some of our most important largest customers have been quite willing to share their views. I would say, I think that their overarching \u2013 I sort of described it in the prior answer, their overarching view is that they're more optimistic. They ultimately are spending more, they're ultimately hiring more and they're feeling better. And I think they feel like they have more visibility in some very important areas that were hanging out there, regulatory and tax, there was a serious lack of clarity on where those things were going over the last bunch of years. So, I think they're feeling good and they are definitely both traveling more in a transient and a group context, and they're spending more.","It's at the food and beverage numbers I gave in the prepared comments because I think that's an important note. It's only one quarter, obviously the trends have to start somewhere. But I think it is reflective and as I talked to our teams and I talked to CEOs of \u2013 that run a bunch of the companies that are big customers of ours, clearly that confidence is translating in them letting sort of the loosening up on the purse strings. If you talk to the folks in the hotels as the big groups are coming through, people are just spending more on individual events, they're doing more individual events, they're doing coffee breaks that they might have cut out, lots of examples.","But, again, it's the quarter, but it's what I think is the beginning of a good trend of the confidence in the business community, translating into higher spend. One of the things that I look at, as I've talked about many times, is non-residential fixed investment. And I mentioned it in the comments. If you look at what's going on with those numbers, those numbers are \u2013 year-over-year growth rate is estimated to be up pretty materially, close to 6%. Again, reflective of the fact that corporate America and for that businesses, small, large, medium, are making more investments in plant, equipment, technology, and the like, all of which is great for our business, because it's a very high correlation to demand growth for hotel rooms.","So, I don't want to be too much of a Pollyanna, but I'd say, vis-\u00e0-vis, if I were talking to these customers a year ago, it was a very different conversation. I mean, they weren't jumping out of buildings, I mean, but they clearly were not as confident as they are today. I mean, it was a fairly stark contrast in conversations today versus a year ago.","In terms of the cycle, I mean, I think this has all been pretty well chronicled, but there are some differences. I mean, obviously this cycle has been a lot longer, which I know sort of worries everybody. I'm not sure that it should necessarily. I mean what's happened is it's been a longer cycle, but a much lower growth cycle. If you've look at the RevPAR growth that we've had, and even in our best years and particularly after coming out of one of the greatest recessions, one of the biggest dips in the history or the biggest dip in the history of the business, you would argue it was sort of anemic annual growth. So it was longer, but lower growth.","I think that was driven, as has been well chronicled, by just more modest macro growth. You never had big GDP growth years coming out of the great recession. So the economy never really got overly juiced. The financial markets were incredibly disrupted in the great recession, historically so. So they did not provide coming into the recovery a lot of capital for growth of new units. So even though you've had reasonably tepid macro growth, you've had historically low levels of supply that are now, I would argue, 2018 is the peak year in the U.S. for supply, which will peak at the long-term average, which is lower than any peak I can remember in my history. And I think when you look at like 2019 numbers actually you're going to see most forecasts and ours agree with this, suggest that for the full year 2019, supply is going to go down back below the long-term average. So I think that's been helpful.","You've had multiple re-accelerations, two or three depending on how you look at it. In terms of RevPAR growth. Again, a little bit different. We've had re-acceleration in prior cycles, but I think sort of the anemic nature of this recovery has created a little bit higher beta experience when you're at lower levels of RevPAR growth and things are moving around in the economy, it's created slowdowns and slower periods and acceleration periods.","I do believe that in the end, the laws of supply and demand are alive and well. And what we're seeing right now is an acceleration that I think is reasonably sustainable just based on the underlying macro trends that I've covered in a couple of different ways already on the call. And how long that goes on is hard for me to say. I don't have that crystal ball. But as I said, it feels reasonably sustainable, meaning you do not have a supply issue and demand which will follow. Macro growth indicators feels like it is picking up, both in the U.S. and around the world, not like a rocket ship but picking up, and it feels like we have a decent sort of foundation for a reasonable period of time of sustained economic growth, which will support the business. So I think you could have a period of at least a couple of years of good same-store results. I think beyond that, I don't know. It's not that we couldn't. It's just hard to prognosticate that far out.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Chris, thanks. That does it for me.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. I guess following up on the answer to that last question, looks like you have about $150 million to $350 million of remaining buyback left in the total distribution over the remainder of the year. I guess, in a backdrop where you feel like you might get a little of an extension, how are you thinking about deploying that outstanding buyback? And as a follow-up, if the market does strengthen further, does that change how you think about either the deployment near-term or your target leverage ratio? Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Stephen, it's Kevin. I'll take this one. So, I'd say, yeah, you're thinking about it the right way. We've done $1.2 billion of buybacks so far. So if you go $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, less the $200 million dividend, that gets you to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. So $200 million to $400 million left to deploy for the rest of the year. And, look, that could vary a little bit based on market conditions, but I would say, generally speaking, we would expect that to be pretty even over the balance of the year. And as we told a lot of the folks that we talk to around the HNA offering, we expect to be in the market kind of always, right. And so, in answer to the second part of your question, the way we think about capital return is consistent, and nothing that happens opportunistically is going to change the way we think about capital return more broadly.","And, on leverage, I think you asked about leverage. The range of leverage that it would have us at on the guidance range is 3.25 to 3.35 times, and that's by the end of the year. At spot today, we're a little bit over the range we've given in the past of 3 to 3.5 times. But, by the end of the year, we'll be comfortably within the range, given the range of buybacks we've given you.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody. I don't think you answered this question specifically the way I'm asking it, hopefully. Good morning, everybody. Good quarter. But, Kevin, you mentioned before, the U.S. you would expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 3% for the full year. And within that band, how do you see business transient growth relative to group and leisure transient?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. So good question. I think we said lower half, right, which implies 2% to 3%, as you're right. And I would say, business transient was a little bit better in this quarter than it had been in prior quarters, and we expect that to continue. You heard Chris say in his prepared remarks that we see group positioned in the mid-single digits. So that probably realizes at the end of the day to the middle or upper end of the range. We expect leisure to be sort of middle or upper end of the range continued. So that, mathematically, would suggest that business transient would be sort of in the lower half of the range, kind of consistent with our overall U.S. guidance. And it does drive a half or more of the results in the U.S. So that already...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Recognizing there is potential if things continue on the current path for upside in that 1% and 2%. If you really cleanse last year 2017 of all the noise of holidays and the hurricanes and the like, business transient was pretty much flat to up 0.5 point. So pretty materially better in business transient than what we've been experiencing.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then so the 100 basis points of RevPAR growth guidance change versus three months ago, is it even across the three segments or is it more group and leisure versus business transient?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think it's even. I think if you look at the numbers on the beat in the first quarter, if we look at expectation in our forecasting, which we do hotel by hotel all around the world to aggregate it to our new forecast, I think it's across the board. We think leisure is going to be better than we thought a quarter ago. Business transient is going to be better than we thought. Maybe group a little bit. Maybe we were pretty optimistic on group, honestly, because the position was pretty darn good. So we still feel good, even a little bit better about group. Probably the upside in there is less because we were already factoring for that, but upside definitely in business transient from where we were and leisure transient.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I know it's early, but your new credit cards have been in the market for a few months and they have been well received by the travel community. Have you seen more spending on the cards? And do you think you may be able to get higher fee growth from those cards than you originally forecasted?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Anthony, it's Kevin again. Yeah, look, your assessment of both, the fact that it's a little early and that the cards have been well received, is accurate. I mean, we've been getting great traction on social media and otherwise in terms of customer feedback about the cards. But it is early days, right. So we expect those cards to be successful and to drive customer engagement and better performance in the hotels and ultimately market share, but it's a little bit too early to say whether the trajectory of what we thought on license fees will be higher than what we've said in the past.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And could you go into more detail about the customer-centric pricing? How that differs from some of the things you tried in the past with longer cancellation fees and member discounts, and what impact do you think that could have on your ADR growth?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean the idea behind \u2013 we've talked about it on a bunch of calls now, we're rolling it out, and by the summer it will be globally rolled out. I think the idea, not unlike other industries, including the airline industry, being a decent model in this regard, is to give customers choice. And instead of having it be a stick, have it be more of a carrot that if you want more flexibility, you're going to pay a little bit more for it, but we'll give you that option. And if you don't need as much, which a lot of customers don't, we'll give you a little bit of an incentive to let us know, so that we can manage our inventory better.","So, essentially, what we did was, in a grossly simplified way, is we took what used to be BAR, Best Available Rate, we got rid of that, and we created a fully flexible rate that's higher than the old BAR by a few percentage points. So still, we can tweak these things in lots of different ways and we will continue to tweak these. And then we created a semi-flex product that gives you two to three days generally, where we get two to three days incremental notice on a cancellation beyond our new cancellation policy. And you get circa one or maybe a little bit better discount for allowing us to have that information.","We expect that it will materially, based on the testing and we tested this at gobs of hotels, not a few here and there, but hundreds of hotels, that it will reduce cancellations, and we do think that the behavior that we saw in the test will give us a little bit higher ADR, that it will give you a little bit of RevPAR boost. I don't want to get ahead of us. Let us get it rolled out. But it's not the underlying reason that we've done it. We've done it to give customers more choice and to be able to manage inventory better and further reduce cancellations beyond extending our typical cancellation policies. But we do believe it will give us a bit of a ADR and RevPAR boost. I would say modest, but let's see how it goes and we'll report out as it happens.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Just wanted to ask two things about the guidance. One is that the fee growth rate is a bit lower in Q2 versus full year, and I don't know if that's just timing of some one-offs that you're comping from last year. And then also you're guiding to a RevPAR growth in Q2 similar to the rate in Q1, although in theory you'd have the benefit of the Easter holiday shift. So perhaps you're just being conservative. But also wondering if maybe you're thinking that there's going to be less of that hurricane demand in Q2. Is that offsetting the Easter benefit and sort of leaving your growth rate similar to Q1 for that reason? Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Robin. On the fee growth, it's as you thought. It's timing. I mean last year when we signed \u2013 it's timing on a couple of different fronts. But one of the big drivers is last year we signed the Amex credit card deal in the second quarter, and there was a catch-up on the remuneration because the pricing was retroactive to the full year, so just a little bit of a year-over-year headwind there. So nothing much else going on there.","On RevPAR, yeah, I mean, basically, we gave the guidance of 3% to 4% in our official guidance, which by definition is higher than our 2% to 4% range. I think you're responding to the fact that Chris is guiding us to the top end of the range, which probably suggests that you take the over on the full year a little bit if you had to, right. So the Easter benefit does flip over, which is why we gave 3% to 4% as the stated guidance. And there probably is a little bit of slow down as the hurricane-related business dissipates. But generally speaking, as we've said, it's not that much different. Group is a little bit stronger in the quarter, which is helping as well. But generally speaking, there's no different trends from second quarter versus the balance of the year.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","With the positive trends you've been seeing both on the RevPAR and in the economic indicators, does this change at all about how you think about delivering net unit growth over the next few years? How you think about delivering net unit growth over the next few years? And I had my notes last quarter, you were talking about 6% to 7%. Any changes in that thought?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I hate to make it too short, but I think we're still comfortable, very comfortable for the next two or three years in the 6% to 7% zone. I mean, could that change? Of course. I mean, what would need to change? Probably the re-acceleration of fundamentals in the U.S., ultimately trickle through to the financing markets which open up to more development, which ends up allowing us to continue the strength that we're seeing overseas and the U.S. sort of turns around and picks up.","That certainly could happen, Pat. We haven't seen it yet. If you look at what's going on in the lending community, it's been generally in the U.S. sort of tightening. I'd say it, throughout most of last year, there was a tightening. Now it's fairly stable. If the fundamentals stay strong for long enough, I suspect that will flip around. But there's a long gestation period associated with that. Which is why I said in earlier comments, I think the peak in the supply cycle in the U.S. is probably this year, when you look at it statistically. So, again, it's \u2013 not to be too long-winded, it sort of depends how long this re-acceleration lasts. It could naturally trickle through, but it will take some time. But we're pretty confident in the 6% to 7%, and we think those are good numbers.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Chris, just to follow-up on that last point. I think, you gave some color in the prepared remarks about Asia Pacific and China, in particular, being a part of your pipeline. Any more color you could sort of share with us a little bit on how your \u2013 specifically your franchising initiative with Hampton is going? Or how much of that pipeline is coming from, let's call it four and five star managed versus franchised over there, since it's such a big part of the growth that you're seeing?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we're \u2013 I mentioned, as you said, in some of the prepared comments that we've got a big chunk of our pipeline is in that market. 24%, I think, with a bulk of it under construction. It's a mix, but increasingly the mix is going towards the mid market. I've been pretty well chronicled in saying that that is a major trend there and pretty much every other part of the world, just as you have middle classes continuing to emerge around the world, that the mid market is what they can afford. And so you incrementally are seeing more demand growth in that segment. And obviously we want to be able to serve all customers, wherever they want to be, for whatever need they have. And that is increasingly one of the major areas where we can serve customers.","So we went from, if you look at it five years ago, and I think fairly consistently with the industry. But I think we've been ahead of the curve, honestly, on the mid market in Asia Pacific, and particularly China. We were probably doing 90% upper upscale and above in China five years ago. If you look at it today, I would say it is probably 75%\/25%, something like that. 75% meaning mid-scale versus upper upscale and above. I think that is absolutely reflective of what is going on in the market with demand. And China, like everywhere else, is reverting to the mean in that \u2013 in the sense of what's getting developed is what makes economic sense. Where if you go back five and ten years ago a lot of what was getting developed was, in effect, part of an infrastructure spend, where the economics didn't really support it.","So, the good news is we're growing across the board. We've got great luxury stuff opening in China, tons of Hiltons, DoubleTrees, we've got Embassy coming. But when you wake up in five and ten years, Hampton particularly and Garden Inn, and ultimately other of our focused service brands will be where we have the massive sort of \u2013 where we've been able to create the network effect. We're well over 200 deals done with our master franchise relationship with Plateno. We're talking to them in lots of different ways about expanding that relationship. More to come on that. But I think it, given that Hampton with Plateno is the fastest growing of the international brands in pipeline in China, I think that alone sort of supports the success we're having. And if you went and saw the properties, which, of course, I've done, and I recommend doing, they're fantastic properties. They're doing a wonderful job in terms of what the product is, in terms of delivering service, and helping us build our network out in China. So, we have had great success. We have really \u2013 we're very optimistic about where things are going with Plateno and Jin Jiang.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. And I guess, just as a follow-up, maybe to stay with the same theme. I mean, in terms of those deals, are they \u2013 we do know that a lot of three-star hotel build out in China is conversion activity from other types of real estate. They tend to be these sort of structured lease deals. Is the stuff that you're doing, is it more purpose built? Is it kind of that four-star working its way down, right? But \u2013 or is it \u2013 are these conversions, things you're able to cycle through the pipeline more quickly?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It's a mix. But I don't have the stats, to be honest. But if I had to guess at it, Shaun, I'd say it's at least 50%\/50% adaptive reuse. I can \u2013 maybe I'll follow-up, we'll follow-up directly. But it's a big \u2013 a bunch of the ones I've seen and I know in the 200 plus deals we've done a significant percentage are adaptive reuse.","Now, they're typically, there are a few cases where they were hotels that never really got off the ground and got gutted and turned into a Hampton. So effectively purpose built as a Hampton because we're not letting them not follow the standards. But the bulk of those have been like other uses, like office buildings and other things that literally got built and essentially never used, they were built and there was really no demand. And so they're changing their change of use. But the product, if you went and saw it, again I \u2013 which I have is terrific. I mean, these are \u2013 when they're adaptive reuse of existing hotels or an office building, they are gutted and built to our exact standards for Hampton. And they've done a really very, very good job with the product.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. So, in terms of the U.S. RevPAR growth and your outlook for it, how are you thinking about the variance between kind of the high end and low end properties, and then maybe different regions, I'm thinking more in terms of cities versus suburbs. I noticed that in the first quarter the STR data suggested you saw an acceleration in top 25 markets where it actually beat the rest of the country, when that was definitely the under-performer, historically. So how are you thinking about that? Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Thomas. I mean, I'd say in terms of segment performance, top end luxury versus bottom end, our experience has not been that much different in the U.S. than overall. Although, as Chris pointed out, on a chain scale adjusted basis, we outperformed in the first quarter. So we took market share. And overall, most of the cities in the U.S., are starting to absorb \u2013 as I'm sure you know, are starting to absorb their supply and do a little bit better. In New York, you're absorbing supply. In San Francisco, you're coming through the Moscone Center renovations and things like that. And the hurricane-affected markets are obviously doing quite well.","Florida is doing really well because they're not only getting some hurricane demand, but lapping over Zika and things like that. So, I'd say generally we're performing in the same overall way. What you see in terms of our under-performance in the first quarter versus the broader STR result is simply weighting. So I'd say nothing, no anomalies in terms of the way we're performing in the U.S. versus overall, other than we took some share in the first quarter.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Kevin. I guess my question was more on the outlook. I mean, are you thinking that \u2013 one thing that stood out to me in your prepared remarks was just inbound U.S. travel was up 9% in the quarter. I mean do you think that that's going to drive strength in U.S. cities versus suburbs? And how are you thinking about chain scales in the same way?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say \u2013 sorry, the answer on the outlook, we don't have any reason to believe it'll be different than the first quarter. So, apologies for focusing on the first quarter. International inbound clearly is going to help. But keep in mind that it's 5% of our overall business. And in the cities, as you point out, is 20%. So it's clearly going to help New York, I think, international inbound revenue was up in the first quarter for the first time in two years. So, that's clearly helping the New York recovery and will with some of the other cities.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","The other thing, Thomas, that's helping in a bunch of suburban markets is oil and gas. So we're now finally starting to see everybody knows energy business has been picking up a lot of steam. Huge amounts of capital investments going in. Lots of energy, gas coming out. Oil and gas coming out of the ground and that's starting to flow through into the business. So we're now starting to see oil and gas markets are outperforming the broader markets. So, I think you have some good things going on in cities, with international. You have some good things going on in some of the suburban \u2013 outer suburban markets that are energy related. So fairly good news sort of across the board, I think.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks. It looks like you reduced commissions on group bookings through third-party intermediaries. And I was just wondering if you could talk about the strategy around that a little more? Is that a relatively small piece of your overall group bookings? And does it signal that you're more confident in just, I guess, direct bookings through your own sales force?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It's not an insignificant part of our overall group bookings. I think, Thomas (sic) [Smedes], as you might imagine, it's a delicate balance of trying to maintain \u2013 drive the business results, maintain great relationships with intermediaries that we want to have a good relationship with. But to serve our owner community well in terms of driving share and performance, but doing \u2013 driving it with distribution strategies that are cost-efficient. And so I think in part, yes, there's a confidence that we have in our ability to continue to drive group business. We obviously have great relationships with intermediaries. We want to continue to have a great relationship with them. But we also realize, representing our owner community that we need to continue \u2013 that you've seen huge increases in the percentage of group business that has an intermediary over the last decade. And that, in order to be responsible for the whole system, and to deliver profitability to owners, we need to drive efficiencies and this is a means to being able to continue to drive efficiencies and distribution costs.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just speaking \u2013 sticking with OTAs for \u2013 or commissions for a moment, I was just wondering, could you remind us when your next OTA contracts come up and what you're seeing in terms of overall bookings through the OTAs...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I don't think we actually disclose those things. But I will say, we are not in the middle of one, right now. We don't have any this year. So, assume maybe next year. I think, the strategy remains the same, which is we have a healthy relationship with the OTAs. When we negotiate our deals, sometimes they get a little dicey. But we have generally a healthy relationship, our focus with all the OTAs and there are a bunch of them that we work with, obviously, the two largest is about driving incremental business. And so, we've really tried to be intelligent in partnering with them and in structuring our deals with them to focus on the parts broadly. Every hotel, every region is different, but broadly focusing on distribution with them, where they can really add incrementality to the business in a reasonably cost-efficient way. And that is fairly typically with infrequent leisure travelers on weekends. Not always, but mostly.","And so all of the structure of how we're doing things is to try and bifurcate the business into pieces. Obviously, try and drive the best distribution cost outcome that we can, again, to represent our owner community and the system. But there are plenty of opportunities where we can work with OTAs and other intermediaries where we can drive incremental profitable business, and that's what we want to do. We have had a huge effort, as you know, and you're only going to see more investment and activity in the area of building \u2013 continuing to build more direct relationships with our customers. You can see that we continue to push hard on making sure that our customers get the best value proposition by being members of Hilton Honors, and that means they get the best price. That means that all the other things they get as a consequence of being a member of Honors, in terms of the experience and the like, is driving a value proposition. And you'll continue to see us market very heavily to people so that they know those things that they are getting at a better value and a better experience by dealing directly with us.","And ultimately, trying to drive as many people as we can in through our direct channels and, particularly, our app. And so, I've said many, many times, it's not that we don't want to have relationships with the OTAs, we do. We want those relationships focused in the areas of incrementality for us. And we want to have direct relationships everywhere else. And so, you will see from now until the cows come home that we're going to have an intense focus in both the value proposition and the marketing ends of building the direct relationships with customers.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, everyone. Just going back to China, the RevPAR there has been quite strong for a while. I'm just curious, how much of it is due to building the brand, signing up more corporates and using less OTAs, and is there a lot of runway to do the up-mixing?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think, RevPAR performance in China has been good because China's economy is good. And both inbound business to China is strong. Travel within China is very strong. Chinese travelers make up the bulk of our business now in China, which is very different than a decade ago, and they want to see their country. They're traveling on business. Economic activity continues to be \u2013 GDP growth continues to be very strong in China. So, it feels good now. All indications, as we look at our business, suggest that it's going to stay strong. We clearly have a big new portfolio of hotels that are ramping up, and ramping up strong that is adding to it. But even if you take those hotels out, overall, RevPAR performance in China leads the world. So, things are very strong there.","Our market share in China, as a result of the relationships we have across the board with intermediaries, but most importantly, with our direct relationship having built out a terrific sales force ahead of sort of the curve of our size in China, our index there, our market share is very strong. Frankly, if you look at the first quarter, our market share in the major regions of the world are equal to what we see in the U.S., which has never been the case. So, the brands are performing around the world really well. Our commercial teams are performing exceptionally well. And the network effect that we talk about that for so long we've had here in the U.S. that we've been building elsewhere will continue to build. But if you look at it on a simple metric of market share, we have very comparable market share now in all the major regions of the world, which is wonderful to see, and obviously indicative of the strength, but also indicative of what's to come in growth. Because, in the end, owners are investing in our system for a very simple reason, that's to make money. The higher our market share in all parts of the world, the more people are going to sign up to build us hotels.","So, we're very excited to see the performance of the brands and commercial efforts in China, and around the world. They're going to help stimulate more NUG in the years to come.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then a quick follow-up on the 59% of occupancy coming from the Hilton Honors members. Is that a North America stat or is that a global stat?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Global stat.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher J.

Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Some peers have broadened their reach to other travel platforms or experiences. Maybe kind of two-part question for you. One, why hasn't Hilton gone that route yet? And then, two, how do you think about the hotel business, kind of high level, more evolving to top to bottom offerings for travelers today?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I'm guessing that the real question is home sharing? Is that the way I should interpret that?","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's one of the components. Just kind of more of travel-related platforms, and just in the context of increased customer loyalty and the brands going after a greater share of everyone's wallet.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, good question, obviously, topical this week. You can imagine that we are always looking at options in terms of what we can offer our customers. That's why we've launched five new brands in as many years, and we've got four new brands that will come out over the next year or so. And we've looked at other areas in the travel space to judge whether we should do it. We obviously, in the home-sharing space, have spent a huge amount of time over the last few years, looking into the space, looking at it from a competitive point of view, looking at it from the standpoint of this is something we want to do.","And at least at this point, obviously, if we had done something, you'd know it. We have decided not to do it. That's not to say that we wouldn't consider that in the future at some point. At the moment, we believe, as you've heard in my description of Airbnb in the past, at the moment, we believe it is enough of a different business that it is not something that we need to or should focus on. That delivering for our customers the core experience of a very high quality, consistent, differentiated product, with amenities associated with it, and with very high quality consistent service delivery, is what they come to us for. And that we believe, at least at the moment, the best way to deliver that is in the way that we're doing it. Where we have the controls in place, in terms of the product, amenities, service delivery, to be able to consistently give them something they want, and frankly, something that they will pay a premium for. That's why we have the highest average market share of anybody in the space.","Again, I'm not saying that at some point, depending on how customers' demands change that we wouldn't do it. It's something we've thought about, considered, but at the moment, it is not something we're pursuing. And other things that are sort of outside the \u2013 obviously we're looking at other brands, other segments within the more traditional lodging space, other ideas. Again, we look at them, we try and be thoughtful about them. We're always considering options, but have not chosen to follow the path on any of those yet. And if we do, you guys will be the first to know.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Understood. Thanks for that.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.","In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today\u2019s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. Unless otherwise noted, comparisons to the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2016 results assume that the spin-off transactions had occurred on January 1, 2016. Please see our earnings release for additional details.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company\u2019s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide an update on our expectations for the year ahead. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re happy to report fourth quarter results with top line and bottom line performance exceeding the high end of our guidance. As a result, our full year adjusted EBITDA and EPS also beat expectations and we returned nearly $1.1 billion or more than 5% of our average market cap to shareholders. Specifically in the quarter, RevPAR grew 3.8% with all brand segments exceeding our expectations. U.S. RevPAR increased 3.2% largely driven by strong group and corporate transient business. Holiday shifts and weather impacts further help results.","We expect this momentum, positive momentum to continue and are optimistic about the year ahead. Looking at macro indicators, forecast call for accelerating growth in GDP, nonresidential fixed investment and corporate profits, which all bode well for continued demand growth.","Forward group booking trends also support continued optimism. For the full year 2018, group position is up in the mid-single digits with particular strength in company meetings and nearly 80% of group business is already on the books. Booking pace in the quarter for all future periods was up in the mid-teens, given increased demand and improved conversion.","On the supply side, we think growth in 2018 will likely be at or below the long-term average. As a result, we\u2019re maintaining our full year RevPAR guidance of 1% to 3%, but would expect results end up between the midpoint and the high end of the range. Additionally, we should continue to benefit from great traction on the development side of the business as we continue to outperform on share of global supply growth.","For the full year, we expect to sign again more than 100,000 rooms and deliver net unit growth of approximately 6.5%. The strength of our brand portfolio and commercial engines are evident in our industry leading and growing RevPAR index premiums, which continue to help us drive strong unit growth. Meanwhile, the broad diversification of our pipeline helps mitigate the impacts of development cycles around the world.","In 2017, we opened more than a hotel a day. We also reached record approvals of roughly 108,000 rooms and record construction starts, both of which exceeded expectations. In fact, we finished 2017 with the most rooms under construction in the industry, which account for 21% of rooms under construction globally. At year-end, our pipeline totaled nearly 2,300 hotels and 345,000 rooms, representing an increase of 8% in our U.S. pipeline and 15% internationally. We estimate our pipeline will generate nearly $700 million of stabilized annual adjusted EBITDA.","Internationally, we\u2019re actively pursuing additional growth opportunities by expanding into new markets and introducing new brands to existing markets. As a percentage of our total pipeline, the Asia Pacific region accounts for nearly 30%, EMEA accounts for roughly 20%, and Americas non-U.S. about 5%. In total, we have a strong international pipeline of 900 hotels and more than 180,000 rooms, including our recently signed 200th Hampton Hotel in China. For 2018, we estimate roughly 40% of our net unit growth will be located in international markets. Assuming the buildout of our entire pipeline, our international exposure increases from roughly 25% of rooms today to nearly 35%.","We also a great development story in the U.S. led by conversion opportunities in our recently launched Tru brand. Curio, and our newest brand, Tapestry, which launched just last year, are particularly well positioned for conversion. Combined, these two brands have more than 50 hotels opened and 80 in the pipeline with each brand expected to double its presence within the next two years.","Following the addition of several world-class Curios, including the Hotel del Coronado and The Statler Dallas, we look forward to converting other impressive properties in the coming year with anticipated openings in cities like Washington, D.C. and Paris and resort destinations in Japan and Costa Rica. We\u2019re also benefiting from the fantastic traction with our Tru brand following the brand\u2019s debut in Oklahoma City last April, we opened eight more properties in 2017, spanning the U.S. from Las Vegas, Nevada to Portland, Maine. We now have over 500 hotels opened and in various stages of development, including sign deals for three hotels in Canada with the first expected to open this year, marking an exciting milestone as the first international Tru by Hilton.","In 2017, we added over 11 million members to our loyalty program for a total of over 71 million members at year-end, up nearly 20%, including a record number of enrollments in Asia Pacific, which doubled our membership in the region. To kick off 2018, we\u2019re enhancing our Hilton Honors program to give our members even more value when they stay with us. Soon we\u2019ll start rolling out new perks, especially for members of our highest tiers. These benefits include gifting elite status to another member, receiving bonus points for nights beyond a certain milestone, enrolling overnight to jumpstart earning status for the next year, all increasing the value and flexibility of our program.","We\u2019re also excited to share that our new portfolio of Hilton Honors American Express cobrand cards are available to our members and cardholders. The new card portfolio will give our customers and small businesses even greater choices and more benefits, making these the most rewarding Honors credit cards to date. We expect these cards to drive meaningful increases in loyalty and overall card spend not only benefiting customers, but also our total system.","Moving on to technology. We now have digital key available in more than 350,000 hotel rooms and more than 2,500 hotels worldwide with hundreds more coming this year. In December, we officially debuted connected room, a first of its kind high-tech room that enables guests to personalize and control every aspect of their stay from the Hilton Honors app. Trends like digital globalization, automation are, of course, changing how all of us do business. With all of this change, we see tremendous opportunity for us to help redefine the future of hospitality.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I want to touch briefly on the recent tax policy changes. Overall, we think this will be good for the broader economy, be good for the lodging industry and it will be good for Hilton and believe it will ultimately drive incremental demand and free cash flow. Consistent with our previously articulated capital allocation strategy, the bulk of our tax reform benefits will be returned to shareholders.","To finish up, we\u2019re really pleased with our performance in 2017 where we continue to lead in organic net unit growth, we delivered game-changing innovations and strong financial performance and generated significant returns for shareholders. I\u2019d be remiss and not recognizing and thanking our 380,000 team members around the world who deliver the exceptional experiences that drive this continued success.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results and the outlook.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.8% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our results were driven by better-than-expected group and corporate transient demand, and we estimate that holiday shifts and hurricane displacement also benefited system-wide RevPAR by roughly 100 basis points.","Adjusted EBITDA of $498 million also exceeded the high end of our guidance range, increasing 10% year-over-year. Results benefited from better-than-expected performance across the board with solid RevPAR flow-through and greater corporate cost control. We estimate roughly $15 million of the beat versus the midpoint of guidance came from onetime items that we do not expect to repeat this year.","In the quarter, management franchise fees grew 13% to $486 million, well ahead of our 8% to 10% guidance range. In addition to strong RevPAR, growth in license and application fees outpaced our expectations. Our owned and leased portfolio also posted better-than-expected performance, given increase transient business across Europe and healthy group demand in Japan. As a result, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items of $0.54 also beat expectations.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 3.2%, meaningfully higher than our expectations given solid corporate transient group performance coupled with the benefits from holiday shifts and weather, which boosted U.S. RevPAR growth by an estimated 140 basis points in the quarter.","For full year 2018, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth around the midpoint of our 1% to 3% system-wide range. In the Americas outside the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR grew a solid 2.2% versus the prior year due to strong leisure demand in Canada and hurricane-related business in Puerto Rico. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region at the high end of our guidance range.","RevPAR growth in Europe grew 3.9% in the quarter driven by a rebounding demand in Turkey partially offset by softness in London. We expect full year 2018 RevPAR growth in Europe to be at to slightly above the high end of our range.","In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR growth was up 6.1%, in line with our expectations as continued strength in Egypt offset softer demand in Saudi Arabia given political instability and Visa restrictions. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be at the higher end of our guidance range.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 7.6% in the quarter, led by China where RevPAR grew 9% helped by ramping hotels. We expect the country to continue benefiting from occupancy upticks as both transient and group segments improved. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR for the Asia Pacific region to grow in the mid-single digits with RevPAR growth in China of 6% to 7%.","Moving on to guidance. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of 1% to 3% and assume international markets will continue to outperform in the U.S. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.03 billion to $2.08 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of nearly 8% at the midpoint. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $2.49 to $2.60.","For the first quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 3%, including a 100 basis point drag from the Easter calendar shift. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $410 million to $430 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items, of $0.43 to $0.47.","Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate incremental share repurchases and include our adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards. The new standard will affect the way we recognize revenues. There will be changes to several line items across the P&L, but the most meaningful will be the deferral of upfront fees. Going forward, we will recognize upfront fees over the life of the contract instead of at the time we execute the contract. Importantly, the accounting changes do not affect cash flow or cash available for capital return, but we estimate that it would lower 2017 reported adjusted EBITDA by $55 million to $60 million and expect a similar reduction to our 2018 adjusted EBITDA.","Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $195 million in dividends and $1.1 billion in total capital return during 2017. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the first quarter. For 2018, inclusive of cash tax savings of $125 million to $150 million, we expect to return between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion to shareholders or roughly 5% to 6% of our market cap in the form of buybacks and dividends. We expect quarterly dividends to remain at the same level as 2017.","Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly Mr. Jacobs. [Operator Instructions] Your first question this morning will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli","Hey guys, thanks and good morning.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Carlo Santarelli","I have a two part question, both aspects of it I would say are related to tax reform to an extent. But if you guys could comment on kind of post tax reform, what you\u2019ve seen with respect to the business transient corporate negotiated rate discussions as well as any impact on your discussions with developers for the implications that would have for them on future developments.","Chris Nassetta","Yes, Carlo, I\u2019ll take that. And Kevin, you can jump in whatever you might want to add. I\u2019d say, obviously, got done at the very end of last year, so it\u2019s still reasonably early to begin to judge it. But I\u2019d say sort of anecdotally, having talked to a bunch of our customers and been at a bunch of different events where we host large numbers of them, it\u2019s viewed as very positive. Most of the \u2013 if I think about where we are this year and the conversations I was having versus where we were last year, I would say it is a very, very different tone, much more positive. I think that\u2019s being driven \u2013 to your question by tax reform, I think it\u2019s also being driven certainly in the U.S. by the regulatory environment being easier on companies.","So I\u2019d say broadly as it relates to business transient, I would say there\u2019s reasons to be optimistic. We started to see that show up in numbers at the end of last year. I think we\u2019ve seen that continue into this year. I would say it\u2019s still early days in the sense that it\u2019s not consistently better. It\u2019s been a bit choppy, but my expectation is if forecasts are right that this is going to help move GDP growth up a little bit. And given the optimism that I\u2019m sensing from a lot of our big customers and broadly across a bunch of different industries, that it\u2019s going to help drive better corporate transient growth than we had last year, which as you will recall looking at the numbers, was very anemic.","So I think tax reform \u2013 I think everything going on right now globally in terms of global growth, picking up a little bit of steam and certainly in U.S. with the expectations of growth picking up as a result of tax reform and regulatory change are going to be good. In terms of our development community, I think, again, it\u2019s early days. I\u2019d say it\u2019s hard to find somebody that\u2019s not \u2013 that is in business that\u2019s not more optimistic right now than they might have been a year ago or even, for that matter, six months ago. And given that our development community are eternal optimist, they were reasonably optimistic before, they\u2019re even more optimistic now. So I\u2019d say that all bodes well for what\u2019s going on, on the development side.","Having said that, what\u2019s going on in the lending environment is I\u2019d say that\u2019s stable. You had a lot of tightening going on in the development environment throughout last year. If you look at the fourth quarter, that started to really stabilize. Whether more financing availability comes to the market as a consequence of a rebound in the economy, I think time will tell. We haven\u2019t seen that yet, but time will tell. But I\u2019d say broadly, the business community, including our development community, are more optimistic because I think, they think the changes that have been going on over the last few quarters are going to ultimately drive broader growth in the economy \u2013 growth will pickup in the economy and it\u2019s going to translate into more demand growth for hotel rooms, which I think stands to reason.","Carlo Santarelli","Great, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And Kevin, just a clarification. You said the cash tax impact $125 million to $150 million, correct?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. That\u2019s right, Carlo.","Carlo Santarelli","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. So Chris, following tax reform, a pickup in corporate transient travel, which you\u2019ve talked about, possibly supported by your prepared remarks, there\u2019s been optimism by some in the investment community that U.S. RevPAR growth could exceed 3% this year, again, \u2013 for the industry. You\u2019re guiding to about 2% for Hilton. So just maybe wondering, first, if you agree with this bullish view. So if you had to put out like a bull case on U.S. RevPAR growth for the industry for 2018, what would it be and why? And maybe you could just talk a little bit about the implied U.S. RevPAR guidance that\u2019s out there now.","Chris Nassetta","Yes, great question. I think it\u2019s the good question. First of all, I think technically, Felicia, if you go back and listen to my comments we really guided to 2.5%, in the sense that we\u2019re not moving the 1% to 3%, but I said the likely outcome would be from the mid to the high, so I would sort of view that as 2.5%. And that is consistent, pretty much identical to what we delivered in 2017. And so if you take the bull case and remember, everybody that knows me knows I\u2019m an optimist by nature, but I think there are reasons to be optimistic right now. I think if you take the bull case, it would sort of be the following: you delivered 2.5% last year in an environment where group was sort of relatively weak. Leisure transient, relatively strong. Business transient, sort of relatively weak. And you had a big \u2013 a bunch of help from the international markets, which were very strong, that delivered 2.5%.","You fast forward to 2018, I think international markets, by the way, is sort of, take that off the table, are going to be strong again. Our estimation is there \u2013 between Europe and APAC, well, they will be both better than what we think the U.S. will deliver. They won\u2019t be quite as robust. They\u2019re still going to be really good. Won\u2019t be quite as robust as last year, so maybe that creates a teeny bit of drag. But then more \u2013 I think potentially more than offsetting that for the bull case would be leisure transient looks to be sort of good again, right? You have consumer confidence, if anything, picking up, not declining.","So you would argue that that\u2019s a good leading indicator of what\u2019s going to happen with leisure transient. We talked about business transient. While it\u2019s early and it\u2019s a bit choppy, if the economy really is doing what we think and most people think it is doing, that will lead to, I think, a little bit better result in business transient than we got last year. And group, if it plays out as sort of set up for the year where we\u2019re at a mid-single- digit system-wide position with pretty good momentum, it should be better than what was a relatively weak year in group last year. You aggregate that altogether and I think you could certainly conclude that we should do better than last year, which was 2.5%.","And so that would be the bull case. And you would say, legitimately, so why aren\u2019t you giving us the bull case in your outlook? And the reason that we\u2019re not is real simple. It\u2019s February. There\u2019s a lot of year to play out and we want to sort of see these things. We want to make sure we\u2019re very optimistic, confident about group, but we want to see it play out. I mean as we said, 80% of it\u2019s on the books, but we want to see it play out. And importantly, we want to continue to see firming up on the business transient side. If those things happen throughout the year, I think you\u2019ll see us sort of adjustment our expectations. But given it\u2019s our first call, it\u2019s early in the year. We thought being sort of down the middle at this point was the right place to be.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Greff","Good morning everybody. Chris, you started off the call by talking about particular strength in company group meetings or corporate group meetings. Can you talk about how much of a leading or maybe coincident indicator that is for individual corporate transient travel, at least in the past?","Chris Nassetta","In the past, Joe, I would say that the group is typically a lagging indicator. And so it is a little bit of an anomaly that you\u2019re seeing it pickup. Well, I would say that\u2019s the way it usually works. We did see a pickup, at the same time we saw our corporate group pickup. We saw corporate transient pickup. And so in that way, they\u2019re happening at the same time. But I\u2019d say corporate group is a bit ahead of it and more \u2013 the pickup is more stable. Corporate transient pickup has been a little choppier. But nonetheless, I think the trend line is headed in a good direction.","And I can\u2019t honestly \u2013 now look, again, I can\u2019t explain why it\u2019s a little bit different this time other than the fact that I think in corporate, I still think in corporate group, the industry is running at such high occupancy levels overall that people \u2013 the corporate procurement offices are figuring out if they don\u2019t get ahead of it a little bit, they\u2019re not going to be able to have their meetings, where on the transient side, I think there\u2019s still a belief that it can be a little bit more last minute. I think that\u2019s probably the \u2013 what\u2019s driving what I would say is not a major anomaly, but a little bit of an anomaly where they\u2019re either a coincident or they flipped around a little bit in terms of what\u2019s leading and what\u2019s lagging.","Joe Greff","Helpful. Thank you.","Chris Nassetta","Yup.","Operator","The next question will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Good morning. ","Chris Nassetta","Good morning Harry.","Harry Curtis","Good morning. if you could touch on what your leverage ratio ended the year at, your net debt leverage ratio and the math that you were using to get to the $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion and basically ending up at kind of the middle of the 3x to 3.5x leverage ratio target? Thanks.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Harry. We ended the year at about 3.1, the very low 3s. And our $1.2 billion to $1.6 total capital return assumes, call it 3 to 3.25x leverage in that range.","Harry Curtis","Okay. So that was such a short question and answer. I think I get part b.","Chris Nassetta","Breaking the rule, Harry.","Harry Curtis","I know, I\u2019m sorry. Can you just talk about the impact of higher interest rates or the potential impact on higher rates on your construction or development pipeline? And whether or not it\u2019s been locked in for the next couple of years?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Harry. You sort of partially answered it yourself. I mean, the next couple of years is \u2013 the way this construction cycle plays out, the next couple of years is pretty well locked in. And then in terms of longer term than that, if rates continue to go up, that\u2019s probably going to mean the economy is getting better. And as Chris said, our developers are an optimistic bunch. And so even though the capital might get a little bit expensive, what their underwriting gets looks a little bit better on paper. So probably definitely not a big short-term impact and probably doesn\u2019t really have that big of a long-term impact either.","Harry Curtis","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling","Hey, good morning.","Chris Nassetta","Good morning.","Stephen Grambling","You mentioned the addition of 11 million members to total, I think it was $71 million at year-end for the loyalty program. Can you talk to how engagement within your loyalty base is potentially changing? And maybe provide an update on your direct booking efforts and how that may be growing and changing consumer behavior? Thanks.","Chris Nassetta","Yes. I\u2019d say engagement is up pretty materially. I don\u2019t have the percentage sitting in front of me. But clearly, we have the percentage of active members is up pretty materially year-over-year. And not surprising, related to the second part of your question, we\u2019ve been working very hard on to strategies that have more direct relationships with customers, which I know sometimes can get interpreted as like a marketing campaign like Stop Clicking Around or whatever. But it has \u2013 obviously, it is a much more complex and holistic approach, which has to do with making sure what we\u2019re doing with product, what we\u2019re doing with service, importantly, what we\u2019re doing with technology, what we\u2019re doing with very specific parts of the Honors program to drive more \u2013 not only deeper engagement, but more frequent engagement with customers is all, I would say, working in getting more people in the program, higher percentage of them engaged and more of them booking directly with us.","We know that once they come into the program, the vast majority, 90-plus \u2013 I think it\u2019s 95%, close to 95% of customers, when they become an Honors member, start booking directly through us, which is obviously a much more efficient channel. And so I think we\u2019re having really good success. But as I\u2019ve said on lots of prior calls, this is going to be something we\u2019ll be talking about forever and instead, it\u2019s a very comprehensive approach to having deeper, more frequent engagement with customers.","Stephen Grambling","Maybe as a quick follow-up. What percentage of bookings are going through your mobile app at this point?","Chris Nassetta","It\u2019s about 10% and growing.","Stephen Grambling","All right. I\u2019ll jump back in a queue.","Chris Nassetta","10%, and that\u2019s about third \u2013 close to a third or either Web Direct or mobile. So make sure we add that, you\u2019ve got to add the web in that.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, good morning everyone. Chris, I think you alluded to this a little bit in your answer to Harry\u2019s question, but just kind of \u2013 just going back to the supply growth side. One change that we\u2019re noticing as we move through 2017 is that supply growth for the industry overall is starting to peak out. And so my question is just how long do you guys think you can maintain sort of where you\u2019re at on that very significant 6.5% kind of net unit growth? And is there, maybe over the next two to three years or we\u2019re going to see some shift where you\u2019re going to move from a little bit of the majority of that or the slight majority of that coming from domestic that\u2019s going to shift to international? What are some of the puts and takes as we get out in 2019, 2020 to maintain the growth rates that you\u2019re seeing?","Chris Nassetta","I mean, clearly, to your comment or question, Shaun, the U.S. is sort of past its peak. Now we\u2019ve extended it, the peak in the U.S. because of the success we\u2019re having with conversions in particularly Tru. But I think either in 2016 or 2017, that\u2019s where you saw the peak in deal signings in the U.S. for the industry. Having said that, for us, we extended it. And in terms of delivering 6% to 7% NUG over the next few years, I would say I feel really good about it. I mean, not only is it a big world where we have lots of opportunities around the world. And clearly, as the has U.S. slowed down a bit, you\u2019ve seen the international side pickup. We were in the low 30s in terms of representation and international in NUG in 2017, we\u2019re going to be probably in the low 40s, 40 or low 40s in 2018, I would tell you that trend line will continue both because of not just what\u2019s going on in the U.S. but the success we\u2019re having in the opportunities we have offshore are only growing.","So it\u2019s a big world. It doesn\u2019t all move in lockstep. And I think if we do our job, which I think we\u2019ve proven we\u2019ve been able to do for a decade and being thoughtful about how we layer existing brands in various markets, add new brands to some of our existing markets like Tru that we\u2019re going to be able to keep that growth growing. Now here\u2019s the other thing over \u2013 when you look four, five, six years, a lot of things can happen in the world. I mean, if we do our job, we\u2019re going to keep growing at a better pace. As you look at the next two or three, I\u2019m not going to say nothing fully in the bag, but half of our pipeline is under construction, okay?","So that\u2019s 160,000, 170,000 rooms are under construction right now. If you add up what we\u2019re going to deliver over the next two or three years, right, those numbers aren\u2019t that far off. And you add a spattering of 20% to 30% conversions into that number, which we think we have consistently delivered at that level or above. And I think I would say to you, we feel confident that what we laid out at our Analyst Day over a year ago of being in that six to seven range over the next few years is readily achievable. And I would argue sort of a lot of it is already in gestation.","Shaun Kelley","Great. Maybe just one clarification, Chris. The 20% to 30% conversion, is that the annual rate? So they\u2019re kind of the annual number that you\u2019re \u2013 of the deliveries that you\u2019re receiving? Or is it that much actually coming out of conversion rate?","Chris Nassetta","If you average it, every year is a little different. Just things cycle through depending on deals and things we\u2019re working on. But if you look at it over the last five or six years, it\u2019s averaged in that range. My guess is \u2013 so yes, I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll continue to deliver in that range, particularly with having newer brands, Curio being newer, Tapestry being very new. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve talked a bunch about what we\u2019re thinking about doing in the development of our third soft brand, which is in the luxury space. That\u2019s not too far off, so that will be another conversion brand opportunity.","And then Doubletree continues to be a fantastic brand for conversion opportunities and we\u2019ve had great success there. So I think we can definitely deliver in that 20% to 30% range. You add that to what is already under construction around the world. And again, it takes a lot. I don\u2019t want to minimize the hard work as our team listens to these calls and they\u2019re thinking, we got three years of really hard work, boss, to do all this stuff, and they do. But the reality is we\u2019ve got good momentum. And if we do our jobs, we can deliver that growth.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s been about, I think, it\u2019s around six months since you announce in your credit card agreements. What has kind of been the biggest surprises to date? And how are you thinking about it going forward? Thank you.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Thomas. I don\u2019t think \u2013 it\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t think there have been too many surprises today in terms of \u2013 we\u2019ve laid out what we thought the incremental economics were going to be. And so far, those have been, frankly, maybe even a little bit better, but generally inconsistent with what we\u2019ve seen. The new cards just launched, and so it\u2019s early days. And in terms of economic outcomes, it\u2019s probably too early to opine. But so far, consumers are receiving the cards really well and we\u2019re getting great feedback. So we\u2019re excited about the program, but so far, I wouldn\u2019t say there have been any surprises.","Thomas Allen","Okay. And if I could ask a quick clarification question. What was the group RevPAR in 2017? You\u2019re talking about kind of mid-single-digit for 2018?","Chris Nassetta","In 2017, it was up 1.6%. System-wide it was just was up 1.6%, right now system-wide positions mid-single digits, five and change.","Thomas Allen","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Great. Thank you. Maybe I\u2019ll pretend my two questions are also just one question.","Chris Nassetta","People are doing really good at this.","Robin Farley","First, just on your fee growth guidance of 8% to 10%. It seems like you can get there just from the unit growth you\u2019ve talked about and from your RevPAR guidance. So wouldn\u2019t \u2013 can it potentially be a higher growth rate given your non-RevPAR fees in there as well? And then my other question is on a different topic is, just if you\u2019ve had any conversations or just have any thoughts about one of your large shareholders that has been talked about maybe revisiting some of their investments and whether you have any color from them or thoughts on what they might do with their stake.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Thanks Robin. I\u2019ll take your two questions one at a time. The fee \u2013 as to the fee growth guidance, I think what you\u2019re alluding to is our algorithm of RevPAR plus NUG if you think about what Chris has said about RevPAR at 2.5% and NUG at 6.5%. That gets you to 9%, which is the midpoint of our fee guidance. As we\u2019ve talked about, license fees are growing ahead of that algorithm rate, but you also have some of the fees in there, the non-RevPAR driven fees like change of ownership and app fees that are growing a little bit below the algorithm rate. So that\u2019s sort of \u2013 8% to 10% is a wide range and that sort of plays out.","The other thing that\u2019s going on is we had a good year this year in IMF with growth of about 10% in incentive fees, and so we\u2019re creating a little bit, and some of that was due to some onetime and timing items. And so we\u2019ve created a little bit of a headwind there in IMF. And even though that\u2019s only 10% of the fee segment, but it\u2019s sort of all averaging up to about 9%. And of course, we ended up higher this year than our guidance range and we\u2019d like to think we can get to the high end of the range or better this year. But given it\u2019s early in the year, we felt like 8% to 10% was the right guidance.","And then on the next one, I assume you\u2019re alluding to HNA who\u2019s been in the press with your second question. And I\u2019d say like we don\u2019t comment on the dealings of any of our individual shareholders, we\u2019re not going to comment on what HNA might or might not do with their shares and what might or might not be going on with their company. As you know, we have a shareholder agreement with them that contains protections for shareholders, and that\u2019s probably all I will say for now.","Operator","The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill Crow","Great. Good morning. Chris, you\u2019ve talked about some of the gives and takes and fundamentals 2017 versus 2018. You didn\u2019t touch at all on inbound international travel and I think the U.S. lost significant market share last year. Dollar has come down. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any rebound in inbound travel or you feel like you\u2019re making any headway in D.C. and kind of changing the message and maybe some of the barriers to inbound travel?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a good question, Bill. I didn\u2019t mean to exclude it. It isn\u2019t a huge part of our business system-wide. It\u2019s circa 5% of the business. So I don\u2019t tend to think of it as a segment unto itself, I kind of break it down into three mega segments. But it\u2019s a good question. International inbound revenues were down for us circa \u2013 and I think the industry maybe have been a little bit worst, circa 4% last year. I think our expectation for this year is while it\u2019ll be on a little bit of lag with what\u2019s going on with the dollar, that isn\u2019t an immediate impact as people have planning time for travel. But our expectation is and certainly what the early signs that we\u2019re seeing and talking to our teams around the world is that it\u2019s going to be better this year than last meeting we don\u2019t think \u2013 we think it will be flat to modestly up is sort of what our worst case is.","I think that has to do with the dollar, and I hope it has to do with some of the work that we\u2019re doing as an industry to work with the administration to sort of soften the edges of some of what\u2019s being said, not in any way to diminish the profile of security being sort of a top priority, but to make sure that we soften the rhetoric, so that those that are interested in coming to United States, the vast majority want to do no harm to United States feel a bit more welcome. And so we\u2019ve been having \u2013 the industry through our trade associations and a bunch of us individually have been having lots of conversations. And yes, I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re making some progress there. We\u2019ll keep working on that. And the dollar, I think, will help us and give us a little bit of a tailwind as well.","Bill Crow","Thanks. Chris, if I could just ask, I think I missed the answer to this. But the Tru brand, how many do you actually expect to open in 2018?","Chris Nassetta","I think we can open about 40 to 50 this year. And then based on what\u2019s happening, that should be double that in 2019. We would \u2013 we\u2019re hoping to get, let\u2019s say, 50 this year open and 100 next year.","Bill Crow","That\u2019s it for me. Thank you for your help.","Chris Nassetta","Great Bill, thanks.","Operator","The Next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff Donnelly","I\u2019ll try and squeak in maybe a two-parter here as well. Just first one, Chris\u2026","Chris Nassetta","We got new system.","Jeff Donnelly","Chris, you mentioned in your remarks just some of the, I guess, benefits that you\u2019re giving to some of your best loyalty members, it\u2019s just that it feels like we\u2019re at a point where net room demand is beginning to improve and frankly, the competitive field is becoming more like an oligopoly. So I guess, first question is why increase loyalty concessions at this point? And second question, a different topic, I guess, relates to consolidation. I\u2019m just curious how do you respond to investor views that you could use your premium evaluation to acquire another platform and maybe make Hilton an even more lucrative enterprise to use that greater scale to access revenue and expense synergies that maybe you can\u2019t access today even though you are already a very significant platform?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. We do. I\u2019ll take them as you gave them. In terms of loyalty, I don\u2019t view what we\u2019re doing in loyalty as in any way as sort of a space race. Like, I mean, we\u2019re not out there looking at what everybody else is doing and saying, if they do this, we got to one up it and do that. I mean, obviously, our teams are cognizant of what\u2019s going on in the competitive marketplace. That\u2019s not at all what\u2019s driving it. What\u2019s driving it is talking to our customers and figuring out what I said earlier, how do we get them to have \u2013 how do we create a deeper connection with them and get them more frequently engaged with us so that in the end, they\u2019re more loyal to us and they buy more of our products. And so the response that you\u2019re seeing in some of these things that I highlighted, which are not big money items, are things that our customers are saying would make a difference. They don\u2019t cost our system much, but it would create greater engagement, greater loyalty, more frequent engagement, which we think ultimately will drive share.","So everything we\u2019re doing is not about space race, spend more money. Many of these things that we\u2019re doing don\u2019 t cost much of anything. I mean, giving them more utility on points and things. There\u2019s a theoretical cost to some of these, but a whole bunch of them are not particularly costly. It\u2019s not like owners are bearing the burden of cost \u2013 incremental cost. It doesn\u2019t work that way. They\u2019re paying it and we\u2019re \u2013 we may allocate the cost in a different way. And part of this has also been about taking other things away. So we had \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a great example that we\u2019ve had historically where you earn points and miles, right?","And we were one of the few that did of the few that did it. There\u2019s a long history to it long before my time. Super expensive program. Well, we\u2019ve sort of weaned our customers off of that and then reallocated that into a whole bunch of other things that we think will drive more engagement with our customers. So it\u2019s not just sort of add \u2013 an incremental add. It is always about what do we need to do to get people more engage, wanting to come directly to us because that will drive more loyalty, more share and more profitable share in the sense of lowering distribution costs.","On consolidation, yes, I mean, I probably answered this maybe thousand or maybe more times. Here\u2019s the thing, I think from our point of view, you\u2019re right. We do have a good platform. I think if you look at the numbers that we just reported for last year on growth and across the board, I would say we\u2019re pretty proud of those results. If you look at what we\u2019re giving you and expectations for this year on unit growth and the next few years as I described in my earlier comments, we feel really good about that.","So yes, we have been very focused on an organic growth strategy because ultimately, we think it helps us deliver better products that resonate more with customers and delivers better returns for you guys. And so that has been the approach, and we think that it\u2019s working. And now if we didn\u2019t have scale or if we were missing segments and we had big strategic gaps, I would understand the argument. But we don\u2019t, meaning we have plenty of scale. We have great representation across the globe in the most important geographies. And we have all of the major segments covered.","So we don\u2019t have strategic gaps. We have the ability to grow both our existing brands, add new brands and do it in organic way where it\u2019s effectively an infinite yield because there\u2019s really no cost or meaningful cost associated with that growth. So the math is pretty easy and that\u2019s why the focus and I think the numbers speak for themselves in terms of success. Now having said that, I\u2019ve said this a thousand times, too. We would never say never. That is a dumb thing for any CEO to say. We\u2019ve looked at tons of things over the years, you guys know that, pretty much everything has been out there.","When we were private, when we were \u2013 since we\u2019ve been public, we looked at it. We have a team that works with us to analyze these things. To date, we have not found things that really met the standard, which is that it\u2019s something that is very strategically important and a good fit strategically and economically advances the ball in terms of creating material value for shareholders. And so \u2013 but having said it doesn\u2019t mean that we would never find something that would meet that criteria. We just haven\u2019t to date, and we \u2013 so we\u2019ve been very focused on organic growth and I think we\u2019ll continue to do so and continue to deliver what I think are great results with that focus. And if something ever presents itself that meets the test, then we\u2019d consider.","Jeff Donnelly","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes","Good morning. Just a question on your G&A guidance. And I want to, guess, ask if I\u2019m looking at this apples-to-apples. It calls for a deceleration in cost in 2018 versus 2017. Is that looking at it apples-to-apples? And secondly, what may be driving that?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, Patrick. You are looking at it apples-to-apples. Our guidance does call for G&A to go down and it\u2019s pretty simple. It\u2019s the transaction expenses for the most part that we incurred last year in doing the spend.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. If I may ask a quick second question here, regarding\u2026","Chris Nassetta","It\u2019s hard to stop the second question. So, I guess, we got a problem.","Patrick Scholes","Blame Harry Curtis here for that one. Thanks. On your corporate rate negotiations, I had heard there had been some pushback on the sort of the extended cancellation policies. How did that end up for you as far as rate negotiations?","Chris Nassetta","It ended up in the low twos, which is consistent with what we expected. And remember, that was all done pretax reform and sort of before the economy started to get a little bit of this incremental momentum. So that\u2019s what we thought. That\u2019s where it ended up. We did have a little kickback on that, but not material. I mean, I talked to a lot of customers. I\u2019ll put this, not one of them raised it with me. I mean, I know when I talked to our sales teams, they said that it came up, a few people groused about it. But when you explain why we were doing it, I think people understood it and dealt with it.","Patrick Scholes","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s it.","Operator","The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you, you talked about around a 2% RevPAR growth for the U.S. this year. And how do you think that \u2013 how do you think about your owner\u2019s margins in that environment, given there are a lot of cost coming through the system? And does that have any impact on your kind of incentive fees? And they\u2019re most maybe are driven by U.S. results but any kind of thoughts around that.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, Smedes. I mean, you\u2019re right. You sort of touched on a dynamic that has been existing frankly for both our owners in the U.S. and for us and our ownership portfolio, which is at those levels of RevPAR growth given the way the cost base is growing, it gets difficult to grow margins and so margins have been pretty stable. I mean, overall, owned and operated margins for us actually for 2017 were up, but most of that was driven by results outside the U.S. And for us, in terms of IMF is it shouldn\u2019t be a meaningful impact. I mean, you\u2019ve recognized and frankly, most of our IMF comes from outside the U.S. and over 85% or 90% of those, of the IMF does not stand behind owner\u2019s priority return and participates at the house profit level, which, of course, that is \u2013 margins effect house profit as well, but it\u2019s just not \u2013 it\u2019s not a meaningful driver of IMF for us.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And just too often made a mockery of your one-question policy. I did want to ask your Blackstone has been \u2013 linked in the media it\u2019s a potential buyer of the Waldorf, I mean, just curious since that\u2019s such a flagship property for you, would you look to get involved with whomever would potentially buy that asset? Could you make any kind of economic investment? How do you think about the timing and sort of the scope of that project, which seems to have sort of not really moved from the time that Anbang initially purchased it?","Chris Nassetta","Well, that\u2019s a complicated one, but I\u2019ll take it on. The \u2013 first of all, there is activity going on at the Waldorf. If you were to walk in that building, you would see that heavy demolition is going on and on. Anbang has been moving forward. We\u2019ve had\u2026","Smedes Rose","So is it on schedule with what you had initially thought though or it seems like\u2026","Chris Nassetta","Generally, yes. The planning of it is all done and they\u2019re in heavy demolition. And as far as what they\u2019re telling us, they intend to move forward with that. They are \u2013 it is rumored out there that they\u2019re going to sell a bunch of stuff. My understanding is that it\u2019s accurate, I do not, at least at this moment when things can change, believe that that does include the Waldorf Astoria. At least as they have said it to us.","I can\u2019t comment on what Blackstone is doing. They\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re not affiliated with them. If you have a question for what they\u2019re going to do, you can ask them. But my understanding from Anbang, notwithstanding them trying to sell a bunch of different assets around the world. At the moment, the Waldorf is not one of those and they tell us that they\u2019re moving forward and, in fact, as I\u2019ve said, work is going on. We are in a very well protected position there for the record in the sense of the agreements that we have with whoever, if it\u2019s Anbang, that\u2019ll be with them. If it ends up with somebody else, we have very strong agreements that will run with the property.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Bellisario of Baird. Please go ahead.","Michael Bellisario","Good morning, everyone. Chris, just want to go back to kind of size and scale topic and maybe how you think about balancing that net unit growth, which obviously is a big driver for you and investors are focused on. But also being cognizant of existing owners, kind of their profitability and not diluting them with new supply in today\u2019s tough operating environment, kind of how you think about that balancing act?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, I mean, it\u2019s one that we take awfully seriously as you might imagine, given that particularly in a capital-light world, but no real estate timeshare, pretty much 100% of our growth is coming from the ownership community around the world. So we work \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say we\u2019re perfect, okay? Nobody is, but we work really hard and are really thoughtful about each individual project in whatever market it is in and making sure that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to create any sort of meaningful lasting impact to an existing owner. And we have a whole process that we work with owners on where we are adding product in markets where they are there. Thankfully in many of those markets, we have owners that are very present in that market. And if we\u2019re doing incremental work, it\u2019s with them.","And so they\u2019re adding to their own inventory in that market. But where it is in conflict in different owners, we do a whole bunch of work to really analyze and understand theoretical impact. And if we think that it\u2019s not going to be good for them and it\u2019s going to have a lasting detrimental impact, then we walk away from deals and we do it all the time. I mean, we have debates around this very table I\u2019m sitting at with our development teams, we do a whole bunch of analysis and we do walk away from deals on a regular basis.","Michael Bellisario","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.","Vince Ciepiel","Great, thanks. So last year, domestic RevPAR benefited from inauguration, hurricane and a couple other big events. I think on prior calls, you maybe had mentioned that you didn\u2019t see as much lift as maybe the industry as a whole from those one-time events due to exposures. So I guess, my question is in your 1.5% last year, can you take a stab at maybe quantifying those tailwinds? And then as you move into 2018, I mean, do you think that you\u2019ll have a lingering benefit from the hurricane? And then, I guess, early in January based on what you saw, how was lapping the inauguration?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, Vince, I\u2019ll take this. It\u2019s Kevin. I mean, last year in the U.S., I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there was 140 basis points in the quarter related to events. I think for the overall year, it was 100 basis points or maybe even a little bit less of a tailwind. Early in the inauguration over January last year will certainly affect D.C., but on a macro basis, it\u2019s not going to have that big of an impact overall. And that\u2019s all baked into our guidance. And so we do have \u2013 we did mention that some of our brands are not able to drive occupancy as much when these events go on because they\u2019re already full, right? So that has an effect of causing us to underperform on a RevPAR growth basis a little bit versus the industry versus STR. So that\u2019s all baked into our guidance for this year.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.","Chris Nassetta","Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Look forward to catching up with you after the first quarter to give you an update on how we think about the rest of the year. Take care.","Operator","Thank you.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, ma'am.","Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.","In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.","This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our third quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report another strong quarter, driven by our resilient business model. Adjusted EBITDA was at the high-end of our guidance range and EPS exceeded expectations. We continue to increase our industry-leading market share premiums and to deliver strong net unit growth, all leading to increasing free cash flow.","This setup coupled with a disciplined capital allocation strategy enables us to continue delivering long-term value for shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned more than 8% of our market cap to shareholders or approximately $1.7 billion in the form of share buybacks and dividends.","Turning to third quarter results, system-wide RevPAR grew 2%, driven entirely by rate gains. Broader industry fundamentals remain favorable with solid corporate transient RevPAR up 3% and continued strength in group business.","Leisure transient was softer than forecasted, given weather-related disruptions and a meaningful impact from calendar shifts. Accounting for holidays and weather event impacts, we estimate second and third quarter RevPAR trends were essentially steady.","For the fourth quarter, we expect fundamentals to remain favorable but comparability issues due to weather impacts to continue to affect RevPAR results. Our updated full-year RevPAR guidance range is 3% to 3.5%.","Looking ahead to 2019, positive macro indicators suggest continued strength in lodging demand. This, together with decelerating supply growth in the U.S., should lead to fundamentals remaining positive, with regional GDP growth forecast indicating continued strength in international markets. Additionally, areas of the business, where we have better visibility, further support healthy dynamics going forward.","Group position for next year remains up in the mid-to-high single digits, with nearly 70% of group business on the books. And early corporate rate negotiations show healthy year-over-year increases. As a result, we feel good about things heading into 2019 and expect RevPAR trends similar to this year, with growth of 2% to 4%.","Our optimism also extends to our development outlook, where we continue to gain share of global activity. We ended the third quarter with more than 2,400 hotels, totaling roughly 371,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 11% year-over-year, driven by increases across both our U.S. and international pipelines. We remain on track to sign a record 110,000 rooms this year and deliver net unit growth of approximately 6.5% in 2018 and again in 2019.","Highlighting our commitment to disciplined capital-light expansion across segments and geographies, we announced several notable transactions in the quarter. We expect to nearly double our all-inclusive portfolio over the next several years through our strategic alliance with Playa Hotels & Resorts, including adding two additional all-inclusive resorts by year-end.","We also announced the signing of the Waldorf Astoria in Miami, which will feature private residences, retail and top restaurants. With Waldorf Astoria now having 30 properties globally, with recently added hotels in Las Vegas and Bangkok, we continue to gain traction among guests and owners alike.","Additionally, we converted three properties in Dubai to luxury and full-service brands across our portfolio. This conversion significantly increases our presence in a unique and growing market, while further strengthening our partnership with the Al Habtoor Group.","We continuously look for opportunities to broaden our demographic appeal and increase stay occasion among existing guests. With that in mind, yesterday, we launched our newest brand Motto by Hilton. Motto is an affordable brand that combines the best elements of micro hotels and urban lifestyle products. Properties will feature efficiently designed, adaptable rooms, innovative guest solutions and unique F&B offerings, local to each hotel's respective neighborhood.","Deals in various stages of development span prime global locations, including New York City, London, Washington, D.C. and Tokyo. At full scale, we estimate Motto could total several hundred hotels across all major geographies.","Our culture of innovation extends across brands and business areas, resulting in more loyalty members and growing market share premiums. In the third quarter, we added 3.7 million new Hilton Honors members, up more than 16% year-over-year. Our roughly 82 million Honors members now account for nearly 60% of system-wide occupancy.","System-wide RevPAR index premiums rose approximately 100 basis points in the quarter, with all major regions and brand segments contributing to growth. Our web-direct platforms remain our fastest-growing booking channels, a trend we expect to further accelerate with the rollout of Expect Better. Expect Hilton, our largest portfolio of marketing campaign to-date, launched at the end of the third quarter.","I'm very pleased we continue to be recognized for our ongoing commitment to our guests, team members, owners and communities. Most recently, Great Place to Work named Hilton number 2 on their list of the World's Best Workplaces. This is the third consecutive year we've been included on this prestigious list of global companies. Additionally, for the second year in a row, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We're thrilled to be recognized as an industry leader for our Travel with Purpose commitments.","Overall, the macro environment continues to drive favorable fundamentals. And as we look ahead into the balance of this year and into next year, we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive strong top line and bottom line growth and to expand our global presence. As a result, we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow to drive shareholder returns.","Thank you. And now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give a bit more detail on our results and the outlook going forward.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 2% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis. International RevPAR growth modestly exceeded expectations and continued to outpace U.S. growth. As Chris mentioned, weather and greater-than-expected disruption from calendar shifts led to modestly lower top line growth than we anticipated.","Adjusted EBITDA of $557 million was near the high-end of our guidance range, increasing 9% year-over-year. Our performance was largely driven by better-than-expected license fees and greater cost discipline. In the quarter, management and franchise fees increased 10% to $544 million, at the high-end of our expected 8% to 10% range. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.77, exceeding the high-end of our guidance.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook, third quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 1%. Corporate transient and group business remained solid. Performance was somewhat tempered by softer leisure transient occupancy, given weather and calendar-related disruption. For full year 2018, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth of between 2% and 2.5%, given good fundamentals, partially offset by continued difficult comps from the storms last year.","In the Americas outside of the U.S., third quarter RevPAR grew 5% versus the prior year, given a mix of strong leisure and corporate transient trends across Canada and broader market strength across the Caribbean. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR in the region in the mid-single digit range.","RevPAR in Europe grew 6.9% in the quarter, roughly 250 basis points ahead of our expectations. Strength in Turkey, coupled with increased demand in Russia related to the World Cup, largely drove our results. For the full year, we continue to expect RevPAR in Europe to grow in the mid-single digit range, with strong trends across Continental Europe and an improved outlook for the UK and Ireland","In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR grew 1.3% in the quarter, led by increased group volume and strong ADR across resort properties in Egypt. Performance was modestly offset by softer leisure business in the UAE and Dubai, given supply and demand imbalances. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to grow in the low single-digit range.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 5% in the quarter as typhoons and weather conditions slowed leisure growth. Trends in China remained robust with RevPAR up 8%, driven by strong industry dynamics and market share gains. For full year 2018, we continue to expect RevPAR growth for the Asia Pacific region in the high single-digit range, with RevPAR growth in China of around 11%, which accounts for weather-related impacts.","Moving to guidance, for full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of between 3% and 3.5% and adjusted EBITDA of $2.075 billion to $2.095 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. Guidance is in line with prior expectations, factoring for the third quarter beat, with some offset primarily from FX. We forecast diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $2.67 to $2.72.","For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of between 2% and 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $518 million to $538 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $0.66 to $0.71. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate incremental share repurchases.","Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter, bringing year-to-date dividends to $137 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter. For 2018, we expect to return between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.","Further details on our third quarter results and our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We'd like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up that is related to your original question.","Denise, can we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely, Mr. Jacobs. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Chris, not so surprisingly, my first question or my question relates to your 2019 RevPAR growth commentary. I know it's early, but can you talk about how much of that is incorporated from some of ground up, either property level or regional inputs? And just broadly, can you talk about how you're seeing next year in terms of U.S., non-U.S. and then between corporate transient group and leisure? And then I have a quick follow-up for Kevin after that question.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Wow, this could take the rest of the call. I'm happy to do that. So, as you would imagine, this time of year, every year, we go through a process of looking, going top-down and bottom-up. I think, we start our budget process by sort of having a view of what's going on around the world broadly from a macro trend point of view, but also from a micro point of view in the various regions. We have lots of discussions with our teams in the regions and leadership and commercial teams. And then we go about a very granular bottoms-up budget process.","While we're not complete with that process, I would say we are 90% complete with that process, which does give us a very much a hotel-by-hotel and region-by-region look at what we think we're going to produce next year. And so what we would typically do is aggregate that up and then give you, given that we're in October of 2018 and we're looking forward to 2019, give a fairly broad range that's the point up and point down around a midpoint, in this case of 3%, just based on the fact that it's early, as you pointed out.","Important to note, so the range in outcome that we're giving, focusing on the midpoint, is very much the result of that process and very much the result of a buildup of a property-by-property and region-by-region analysis that takes a lot of time and effort by our teams. I think when you think about it, it is informed, from a macro point of view, by a few things. One, the current expectations are both for the U.S. and global GDP growth, that they will be relatively consistent with this year.","When you look at non-residential fixed investment numbers broadly, particularly in the U.S., they have been very strong this year and reasonably strong last year, forecasted to be strong, again, next year. That has the highest correlation to demand in hotel rooms historically.","In the U.S., looking at supply numbers, we think the supply numbers are going to tick down against that backdrop next year. Obviously, in the same way that we are experiencing difficult comps in the second half of this year related to both holidays and weather impacts, those comps, then, for the second half of next year, will become much easier, which will be helpful.","And then getting to the segments, our view, and I said it in my comments, is that we're seeing very healthy growth across all the major segments. If you sort of neutralize for all the weather and holiday impacts and then what's happening right now, which, we think, best we can see, is going to continue into next year, you saw post tax reform, business transient pick up from anemic growth of like 0% to 1% to sort of in the 2% to 3% range. You've seen leisure transient remain relatively steady and strong, sort of in the 3%, 3-plus percent range. And then you've seen group ticking up into the 3% to 4% range. That's what you've been seeing this year.","Again, when we neutralize for all the things that are going on with weather and everything else, we don't think that that changed in the third quarter. We don't think that's changing in the fourth quarter. We think those trends are broadly going to remain consistent and, I think, are supported by where we do have visibility, and I talked about it a little bit, are supported by the fact that we have a very strong group position, pace has been great, position going into next year is, frankly, as strong as I've seen it, and that supports it.","When we think about our special corporate negotiations and the dialogue with our big corporate accounts around both volume and our ability to drive some incremental rate, those conversations have been quite positive and stronger than where we were at this time last year. So, when we put all of that together, again, those macro conditions that I just walked through and then we look at it property-by-property and aggregate it up, that's where we come out.","And I've said this, I think, a bunch of times on the last call and otherwise publicly, next year, at the moment, it feels to us a lot like this year feels but both from the standpoint of our NUG growth but also our same store growth. And I do realize there is a negative sentiment out there. I read the papers, I watch the news, and so I appreciate that.","The reality is, when we look at the business and what it's producing today and we look at the forward trends that we have, it does not reflect. What it reflects is, what we've suggested is that next year, it looks like, all things being equal, we should be delivering results very similar to this year. And so that's what we're trying \u2013 we're trying to give you the best perspective we have in looking at the business in as scientific a way as we can.","In terms of, I think, the only question, Joe, I didn't get there was U.S. versus international. I think it's again common theme. I think next year is going to look a lot like this year. I believe the international will lead the U.S., it will be stronger than U.S. My guess is, particularly with the strong group base and tick down in supply, the U.S. will, probably \u2013 in our numbers, in our rollup will be modestly better, not materially, modestly better; and the international will be modestly lower. And they'll be modestly lower because, hard to replicate the year we're having in APAC and for that matter in Europe, so our expectation is, while it will outpace U.S. growth, it won't outpace it at quite the same rate, so a little bit more U.S., a little bit less international but I would say, I think, when the year is out next year, it looks a lot like this year and it's not going to be materially off of that. Did I miss any of your points?","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, you've hit them all, Chris, thank you. And then, Kevin, just quickly, you referenced FX as an offset or as the drag a couple of times in your prepared comments. What was the FX EBITDA impact in the 3Q? And what's incorporated in the 4Q relative to a quarter ago?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. In the fourth quarter, so in the third quarter, it was sort of mid-single-digit millions. In the fourth quarter, it's about the same. So, if you take, we beat by $7 million, it's the majority of that $7 million coming down \u2013 bringing the full year down to the midpoint is FX.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you so much.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey, good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Just wanted to drill down a little bit more maybe into regional question. First of all, if we were to see any evidence of global economic slowing, probably be in Asia, what are you seeing there as far as pacing in price for the next, say, 6 to 12 months.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","We haven't seen, Harry, a whole lot of difference. You can look at our third quarter numbers, then I think rightfully say, well, it looks like it's cooled off a little bit. But I think they're \u2013 not to make excuses, I think, scientifically, they're just \u2013 there were things going on in Asia that drove that. You had a bunch of typhoons that affect \u2013 some affected in China, a meaningful effect in Japan, other sort of one-time events that affected Southeast Asia. So, those are the things, when we look at what happened in the third quarter, were driving it. The basic underlying trends, like much of the world, we think are relatively stable.","Having said that, it does appear that China's economy is slowing down, sort of, as I said, we read the papers, I was just in China, we're around the world a lot. And so, when I said our expectation is maybe a tick higher in the U.S., a bit lower driven by Asia and Europe, maybe not being able to keep up quite the pace of growth, some of that \u2013 we have certainly built some of that into our thinking. In other words, we would expect China to finish this year sort of in the 11% range as an example.","We are assuming something lower than that next year honestly. I think, it's 8% or 9% from a budgeting point of view, just to put it in context to be reflective of the fact that even though we haven't seen any meaningful trend other than sort of the impact I told you in third quarter, we haven't seen an underlying weakness. The reality is that the economy is going to slow in China, there should be some knock-on effects.","So we've tried to reflect that in the numbers for Asia Pacific, largely driven by what I talked about in China. And same in Europe, Europe is having a really good year. And the expectation is it's just \u2013 to a degree, we're early but we have a great group position et cetera, but group is not nearly as much of the business over there. I think just to be a bit conservative, if you will, we've assumed that we won't have quite the growth rate.","So, we've tried to reflect that in, but in terms of like have we seen real signs of like sort of global slowdown in the core parts of the business, we have not seen that. We are trying to be thoughtful and reasonably conservative about looking into next year to incorporate some of those views, but we have not real-time seen it.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Very good. And let's come back to the U.S. My question is as you've been having conversations with meeting planners and heads of corporate travel, what are they telling you about next year's demand needs? And is there any evidence of pushback? What I'm trying to get a sense of is you've been dealing with them for a long time, how reliable \u2013 how often are they right, is it a reliable forward indicator?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think that they're right until they're wrong. I know that's not the answer you want. I mean, here is the thing. When we're talking to our \u2013 the meeting planners and on the group side, you heard we have a lot of optimism because the numbers suggest we should. I said on the corporate side, special corporates, by the way that's only 10% of the business, so keep it in perspective. But it's a good sideline into the psychology of some of the biggest companies we deal with. All those are positive. I mean, not everybody is created equal but broadly people say they're going to travel more for business and for meetings and they know they're going to pay more and they're willing to pay more. And they're willing to pay more at an increasing rate as compared to what they would have said a year ago.","So, again, I don't want to be Pollyanna, but I think all of that's positive and I think all of those judgments are based on the fact that people think that the global economy, the U.S. economy in the case of U.S.-centric companies are just going to hang in there and keep chugging along, which is, obviously, what is built into the assumptions of our guidance. But the conversations have been quite positive, I mean, not racing to the stars but incrementally more positive than when I was sitting here a year ago. It would be hard to say it in any other way.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Very good. Thanks Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone, good morning and thanks for taking my questions.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hey, Carlo.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You guys talked a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the demand side in China, et cetera, but on the pipeline side, has anything changed with respect to the cadence of your discussions and\/or the kind of ongoing development that would give you guys any pause?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Not really. I mean, I think, why I talked about one of the supporting factors in the macro side on the fundamentals was supply is going down in the U.S., okay? So it stands to reason that it's getting \u2013 if that's happening, it's getting harder for everybody to get deals done in the U.S. Thankfully we fight it twice, we're 11-and-change of the market in the U.S. and we have 25% of the rooms under construction or something like that. So when we fight way over our weight, but I would say the trend line continues in the sense that it's getting \u2013 we're getting more than our fair share, but it's getting harder to get deals done.","So, even though we will hit a record in signings in the world this year, another one off the record of last year, signings in the U.S. will go down a little bit, starts will go down a little bit, NUG will go down a little bit because it's getting harder to get deals done. So it's not getting \u2013 I mean, incrementally it's not getting \u2013 since the last quarter I don't think it's dramatically or materially different, but it's definitely harder, why? Inflation is picking up, cost of labor is going up, cost to build projects is going up. We think by the end of the year, it'll be sort of a 10% increase in the cost to build.","While you're not seeing incredible turn of the wheel and tightening of credit, it's just a little bit tighter, a little bit harder to get things done. Interest rates are a little \u2013 are moving a little bit in the wrong direction. So, all of that adds up to \u2013 it makes it harder in the U.S. and that's why you see supply going down. And I think you'll keep seeing supply go down because it takes a long time for that cycle to reverse.","I would be remiss in not making the following statement. The great news is the reason we're signing record deals and we're going to have a record delivery of NUG this year and it's going to go up, again, next year is because the world is a big place. And we've anticipated the ebbs and flows and allocated our resources appropriately around the world. And so while one market is slowing, in this case the U.S., other markets are picking up. So Asia Pacific continues to pick up. Frankly, all of our international markets continue to pick up. And we continue to get better and better at what we do at sort of building relationships and deploying our brands in intelligent ways to keep our growth going, so that's how we can add more net rooms next year and hit another record than we did this year, notwithstanding the fact that the U.S. market is slowing. And I think we'll continue to be in a slowing pattern until you have \u2013 until the whole sort of system resets itself.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, if I could, Chris, you've always been kind of very firm in your views on M&A and your ability to kind of develop and grow from within. In the current environment, has anything changed in your perception of where and when possible, you would consider acquisitions?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, no, the short answer is no. The filters have always been \u2013 for the 11 years I've been here, the filters have literally remained the same. Does something really work well strategically in terms of brands and our brand portfolio versus what we can do on our own and does it \u2013 can we do it in a way that's really accretive to value? And as we filtered and I say it all the time, we look at almost everything, everything to-date that we have filtered through that, those lenses, really has not made sense versus what we're doing like launching Motto by Hilton just yesterday, where we think we can do it better than anything out there and we can do it exactly the way the customer wants it and create more organic growth without having to buy growth. So, we keep making that decision because I think it's been the right decision. I always end this M&A discussion with never say never. I'm not saying that something wouldn't pass through that filtration system. It hasn't to-date and our philosophy remains exactly what it has been.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you sir.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just, I guess, a couple of quick follow-ups to Carlo's questions. I guess, first, are you seeing any changes in the competitive dynamic as it relates to getting deals done, whether that's terms and\/or the need for key money to incite deals? And would you anticipate that to change if the environment remains tight? And then second, given the current weakness in the stock and market more broadly, I guess, how is your approach to capital allocation evolving? And can you just remind us of your leverage thresholds? Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I'll take the first and give Kevin the second. The competitive environment, I'd say, did not change in any material way. I mean, in the U.S. when there is less getting done, deals get a little bit harder to do. Reality is, as I said, we fight way over our weight because we have the highest market share brands and the highest average market share. That doesn't mean we don't compete. On occasion \u2013 sometimes we don't but on occasion we do. So, I would say in a minor way, I'd say the deal terms in the U.S. have gotten incrementally tougher but not in any material way. Around the rest of the world, really no change, things sort of click along as usual, so I'd say not much to talk about there. Kevin, on capital allocation.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. And then, Stephen, on capital allocation, nothing has really changed. I mean our stated leverage range is 3x to 3.5x. You saw us get kind of the top-ish, maybe a little bit higher on a trailing basis to that range when we did the HNA transaction earlier this year. So, we're still thinking about the same things the same way. We'll continue to distribute the lion's share of our free cash flow. You noticed from our prepared remarks that we're keeping the dividend the same, which means that as the EBITDA of the company grows, the amount available for share buybacks will increase accordingly, but nothing has really changed yet strategically.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, we like the stock at $88. Obviously, we'll like it even better at this price.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask, I think, in the press release this morning, you guys actually put in a comment on the unit growth side around conversion activity and how important that is or maybe becoming. So, could you just give us a little bit more color there? So, first off, is conversion activity accelerating at this point in the cycle? And then what are you seeing or hearing from your development organization on that front and how much of that is sort of factored into your net unit growth outlook for 2019?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, good question. I expect that conversion activity will accelerate more. I would say what we've seen technically so far is a minor acceleration, not much of a uptick. I think when we finish the year, we'll probably do in 2018 about 20% of our NUG will be conversions. I think, ultimately depending on what goes on, this is sort of countercyclical, when things gets tough, conversion activity picks up. We've seen a little bit of an uptick this year. We're not expecting, given our outlook for next year, to see a whole heck of a lot of uptick because we think next year is going to be another pretty good year.","Eventually when a business cycle turns, I think you would see those numbers go up. But what's built into our expectations for our 6% to 7% is a comparable percentage of conversions, which is about 20%. We have almost never delivered less than that and we have more tools and more weapons in the arsenal in the sense that in the old days, we had really one conversion brand in DoubleTree. Now we have Tapestry, Curio, soon soft luxury brand that is coming in addition to DoubleTree and other brands, but those will be the brands where you find the bulk of it.","So, we will eventually see the numbers tick up, I don't think real soon built into next year as a comparable level to this year. So, a lot of next year, when you boil it down with that gap having to, obviously, be filled, a lot of next year is in the bank in the sense that the 80% of it is under construction. I mean, it may move a month or two here or there, but it's in process.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you just give us a sense, Chris, like at a high level, where that number was or the conversion activity was kind of two to three years ago, just as a guidepost for that 20% number? Was it lower two or three years ago kind of and directionally, how much?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, we've been running like 19% to 25%. I mean, coming out of the Great Recession on a much smaller base and the Great Recession, obviously, was a very big countercyclical opportunity, where there was a lot of fear in the markets. I mean we maxed out in the high 30s. I think, I wouldn't expect that we would get to that level again but we've been sort of running around this level. So, I don't feel like this is certainly \u2013 it doesn't feel like it's a big pull to us. My development team, of course, knows they've got to do a lot of work, so if they're listening, I don't want them to think otherwise. But this is something we have typically been able to deliver with a fair amount of ease.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","The next question will be from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I wanted to see if you could put a little finer point on corporate rate negotiations. I know it's only 10% of the business, but the owners are saying it's critical for ADR growth for next year. At one point, you said you're seeing healthy rate increases, but then you kind of broke it down and you said something about occupancy or the demand side. Then you said you hope to see some incremental rate increases. So I'm just curious. Are we looking at kind of 0% to 1% on the rates, are we looking at 2% to 3%? What are you...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think we're looking at \u2013 last year we were looking at like 1-ish, you could argue 1% to 2%, but I think it really ended up in the low 1s. We thought 1% to 2%. It ended up closer to 1% than 2%. Right now, it looks like 2% to 3%. I mean, I talked to the teams yesterday to get the latest and greatest update. And it feels to them like 2% to 3%. Now, again, it's 10% of the business, but obviously a good indicator.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe for Kevin, on the capital return, obviously, you had the opportunity this year to buy back maybe more than you would have, but given, Chris, your commentary on the sameness of next year versus this year in different metrics, should we assume $1.5 billion to $2 billion of capital return?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I think, Bill, the way to think about it is next \u2013 we did bring forward some leverage into this year around the HNA opportunity. So, the trade-off, obviously, is free cash flow. We've got to be careful we're not giving bottom line guidance, but free cash flow, if you just take what we're saying about RevPAR, net unit growth ought to be a little bit higher next year than this year. And then you will have the opportunity as EBITDA grows to re-leverage a little bit, but we brought leverage forward this year around the HNA deal. So, if we were to hit the midpoint of our leverage guidance for next year, it's logical to assume that the amount would be somewhat lower next year than it was this year.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, that's it from me. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Could you provide us some more detail on your group position being up mid to high single digits, what markets are driving that, and is it more volume or rate?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","So it's broad-based. There's not like one industry group driving it or, frankly, one region, although the bulk of our group business ultimately is in the U.S. It is broad-based. It's up, I would say, in the close to 8% range. Now, we, being perfectly objective and as scientific as we can be, we believe some of that has to do with commission policies. We do believe that as we look into next year. Now, the business is going to show up, so it's going to be good for the business but we do believe, as a result of the change in the commission policies, that we advance some amount of bookings and we think that probably means that the real position is 8% to 9%, we think, when you sort of back out the commission effect, it's still very easily 5% to 6% up, which we feel good about. And it's basically split pretty evenly between \u2013 I was just looking at this yesterday as well, it's basically split pretty equally between volume and rate.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, thanks. And on the other end of the scale, some of the limited service brands underperformed in the quarter and this year. Is that just due to higher supply growth or is that a bit of a demand component that is impacting relative RevPAR growth?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think that's what you're seeing kind of broadly across the industry and I think it's a combination of things. Yes, more of the supply growth. Even the supply growth is low and it's going down, you certainly have seen more of the supply growth in those segments, which, I think, is probably the largest contributor. We have some other specific things going on if you look at it. But, I mean, in terms of renovation work going on like in the Hampton brand, I think, 25% of the brand is under renovation at the moment and that has some impact. But even with that, the Hampton brand has grown market share. So, it is still outperforming the market. I think broadly in terms of why is that segment in the market is underperforming is to do with the incremental supply in that area, which will be diminishing.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Great, thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. One, shorter-term question and one longer-term question. You were talking about some of the factors that led Q3 to come in a little bit lower in the U.S. than you had thought. When we look at just the weekly data so far, first half of October is also not off to a great start, so just wondering if you see sort of a clear \u2013 what you see in your sort of next 30 days in the U.S. looking different maybe than kind of \u2013 it looks like some of the same trends have continued in early October, so I hate to be so short term about it but I know that there's concern out there about kind of what happened in the short-term versus previous guidance and all of that. And then my other question is on group, I think, you said 3% to 4% is what the increase was in 2018. I don't know if you put numbers around and you said 70% of next year's group is on the books but where you're seeing rate and volume for group business for 2019 so far? Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Robin. I think for the last few weeks, you're still seeing kind of residual \u2013 you're seeing continuation of the tougher comps from last year, where the storms and the other weather-related events, particularly in the United States, just generated a lot of business last year that we're still comping over. So, our outlook for the year incorporates a little bit better fourth quarter than third quarter. So, I think you're still seeing some of that show up in the weeklys. And then on the group side, I think, it's about the same, the picture is about the same, it's about half and half between \u2013 split pretty evenly between volume and rate in that 3% to 4%.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, but I was asking about your 2019 group, what you have on the books and rate and volume, what level of increases or not increases for 2019 versus what you saw a year ago for 2018?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It's about the same, yeah, it's about the same.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","So, in other words, were the 3% to 4% where group is ending up for 2018, is exactly what you thought it would be a year ago?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's pretty comparable, yeah.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, that's pretty comparable. I think about a year ago, we were saying mid-single digits and it's coming in sort of 3% to 4%, pretty close as we expected, yeah, sorry I didn't understand the question, Robin.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Right, in other words, just thinking about where group came in versus your expectations for 2018 and then how that means for 2019?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","They came in consistent with our expectations.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Good morning. Thank you. My first question relates to your management business. What are you seeing or forecasting for labor costs growing at next year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I think next year, Patrick, probably about the same as this year on the labor side. Probably 3% to 4% all-in wages and benefits, which is, I think, about the same as this year.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, Thank you. And secondly on the group number that you gave for 8% to 9% next year, and correct me if I'm wrong, that's not a same-store number. Do you have a same store number that you can give?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","So, that is the system-wide same-store. What I was trying to do is make sure that we're being honest about trying to filter out the impact of anything we thought that was a result of bookings being advanced because of our change in commission policy. Now admittedly, Pat, that's \u2013 I mean, we're trying to apply science to it, it isn't going to be perfect science, we look at what we're doing through intermediaries versus what we're doing in direct bookings to sort of arrive at an equation that tell us where we think we'd be. Mid-single digits, 5% or 6% is where we think we feel confident without any changes in commission policy we would've been, which is not too terribly \u2013 as Kevin point out, not too terribly different than where we were at this time last year. That's why we think delivering 3% to 4% next year when we finish the year in group growth is reasonable.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Makes sense.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. That's it","Operator","The next question will be from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","To quickly follow up on Pat's question there, just in the context of ongoing union negotiations around the country, I think it's been a little more impactful recently to Marriott then you guys but within that 3% to 4% labor cost assumption for next year, how much variability would you say is included within that range, again, given the ongoing nature of those sorts of discussions?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I don't think a lot of variability. Obviously, we're not going to comment on negotiations going on with the unions, which are ongoing. We have a good relationship with the unions and they've been sorting through market by market deals. I think that we will end up in those ranges regardless of where those deals turn out. Remember also that in our case, it's a little less than a third of our workforce is in organized format, so two thirds of it is outside of that. When you blend it together, we had, in Kevin's number, he's \u2013 in that range, he's...","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It's the whole system, yeah.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","...it's the whole system and he is factoring for that.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then another quick follow-up to the capital return forecast whether speaking of this year, next year, just, in general, how much \u2013 how quickly can you pivot if need be given a short-term dislocation in stock prices as we may or may not be seeing kind of in the current environment, against those longer-term capital return forecasts and also the leverage limits that you guys referred to?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think, if we want to, we have a significant amount of flexibility and we can pivot quite quickly.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Any more specifics around that or just as a general comment?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. That's all from me. Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","All right thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi Research. Please go ahead, sir","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you about this new brand rollout, Motto, when you did Tru, I think you...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Motto, come on Smedes, get it right.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Motto, Motto, sorry.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","You have a Motto. It's not MotoPhoto.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","When you did Tru, Chris, I think that it was initially offered to owners of Hampton Inns and then, obviously, you went on to a very successful rollout. I'm wondering is there anything that you're doing to kind of jump start this brand with your current owners, maybe sort of any feedback on initial sign-ups that you're receiving from developers that you can share with us?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I'm happy, thank you for the question. I'm glad we got a question on our new brand. It seems like people ask about our new brands every call and now we launch one and nobody wants to talk about it but happy to talk about it. We're very excited about Motto by Hilton. And we are, of course, as we would do with all our brands and you're right to point out, look, that we went to our most important Hampton owners largely and gave them the opportunity on Tru. Doing a very similar \u2013 we have a very similar approach with Motto always because our existing owner base has been very loyal to us and we want to be loyal to them. So, not only are we going to them as the first shot out of the blocks to, say, hey, do you want to work with us on this, but there has been a cadre of them that have been very involved in the development of the brand. Let me put it in (50:18). We're always talking to customers and doing focus groups as we design these brands and figure out how to make them tick the right way, so that they'll appeal to customers but we are also working very closely with owners to make sure that we're engineering the cost to build and the cost to operate in a way that they'll deliver returns that work for owners. Otherwise, we'll have a great thing for a customer, but we will have no hotels for the customer to stay in.","So it's very much sort of a dual process. And so we brought a great cadre of owners that we worked with around the world and to be part of that process. And they are very excited about it and so not surprisingly the first deal, many of the first deals we're doing are with existing owners, not all but many of those deals are.","We have essentially, I think, we have six deals I mean these are more complicated than Tru's given that they are urban and by the very nature of what it is, it's a little bit longer gestation period and higher degree of complexity. We have about a half a dozen deals done. I would say, based just on the conversations I've been having including yesterday where we've had a huge group of owners in for the launch here at our Innovation Gallery, we probably have another 20 deals sort of cooking, and ultimately, Tru will be thousands of hotels, okay. Tru will be the biggest brand we have just because of the price point it's at.","Motto will be very big, but as I said in my prepared remarks, it's hundreds of hotels. So I think we're off to a great start. It's a wonderful way for us to better serve our existing customer base. Even more importantly, it's a great customer acquisition, so it's great product that we can attract customers that have heretofore not been able to stay with us that want to be in an urban environment and adventurous and they need a product at a price point they can afford whether they are young, in middle-aged or old that this is where they want to be and this is a product now that we are putting out there that we think will make it much more affordable for them to stay with us. And when they stay with us we have a pretty good track record of getting them to try other things with us.","So we're very excited about it. Again, these are more complicated urban deals they take longer to sort of pull together. But I think you'll see that we'll very quickly get the pipeline into the dozens of hotels and I think we'll start bringing it to life and reality. Hopefully, next year you will be able to take on a tour of the first Motto.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And then I just wanted to ask you mentioned you guys hit about 80 million Honors members at this point. Can you \u2013 have you seen any change in the percent of bookings going to direct versus OTAs or is that ratio still pretty constant.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, the ratio is good what we saw in the third quarter it generally tracks year-to-date, but third quarter number is, we were growing our direct channel share and the OTAs were flat. So that \u2013 and that's before we essentially started the latest big push on our campaign of direct book that started rolling at the end of the quarter. So the trends are what we want to see, which again is not that we're not going to or don't want to work with the OTAs, we do, we just want to work with them in the right times, in the right ways at the right price. And we want to more and more to have a direct relationship as much as we can and that's what we're seeing happen in our channel mix, more growth in direct, our direct channels particularly our web direct channels, and third quarter flat on OTAs.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me, just on the ownership assets, they performed pretty well in the third quarter from a RevPAR standpoint and year to date, I believe most of these are flagship Hiltons in Europe. Is this strong performance really just kind of a product of, Chris, what you were talking about a strong group traveler in Europe or is there anything else? And if your outlook, as you mentioned, for Europe is positive in 4Q and going forward, is there any reason why these assets should kind of come down below the M&F RevPAR? Thanks.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Chad, I'll take this one, I mean, interesting that there are a bunch of flagship Hiltons in Europe that are part of that portfolio, there also are bunch of hotels in Asia that are part of the portfolio. And even though Japan has a little bit of disruption from a typhoon, the RevPAR growth was still quite strong in Japan and a couple of other places in Asia. So you're seeing some of that sort of filter through that portfolio, but Central Europe, of course, was quite strong in the quarter, which helped. And the trends ought to be really consistent in the fourth quarter. It's a very similar outlook.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, thanks. That's all from me.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will be from David Beckel of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for the question. I think it's been a little bit of time since you've updated us on the Hampton Inn rollout in China. Can you just give us an update on signings and openings for the year?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Our Plateno deal is going really, really well. I think, at this point, Jill and Kevin can fact-check me, I think we've done 250 deals-ish. I think we have opened 50. I think we expect to open like 20 more by the end of the year. I think we're hoping that we have about 70 opened and I think we expect to open 100 next year. So it's moving at a great pace. It's having the impact that we want, which is building our network effect in China in secondary and tertiary cities with what is a great product, with a great partner.","Importantly, because if we don't deliver results, people, as I say, stop building us hotels. The performance of the hotels is really, really strong in terms of the returns that our partners are getting on these deals. So we feel very good about it and think it's going to keep cranking.","If you think about what's going on in China, I've said this many times, not dissimilar from other parts of the world, the mid-market is where you're going to see the bulk of the growth, just because the phenomenon of middle class growth at a very high rate, middle class can afford mid-market type brands. And that's why we were so interested to get in with Hampton with a partner to try and build that network as fast as we could and it's working.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And just a quick follow up, given some of the M&A that Jin Jiang has been involved with, has that affected your relationship with them or the development agreement in any way?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No, it hasn't. We maintain a great relationship. We are in constant dialogue with them about a whole bunch of different things, including the Hampton relationship. I think it's the one that they are very positive about and, if anything, interested in speeding it up, as are we, not in any way changing it or slowing it down.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks so much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from David Katz of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, all.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Morning.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Congrats. It all seems quite clear that we're two minutes away from the hour, but I wanted to just touch on one topic, which is your high-end strategy. The portfolio of brands is obviously very complete or nearly complete from top to bottom. How are you thinking about the highest end? I know you're adding Waldorfs and Conrads, et cetera in different places, but just go back to the make or buy discussion as it relates to that end of the business and the degree to which you can bolster through soft branding, let's say, but I'd love a little color just about that specific asset.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, that's a good and important question in the sense that we, if I think about how I allocate my time relative to the size of the business, I allocate disproportionate amount of time to luxury for a couple of reasons. One, it's hard. The deals are complicated and difficult, not many of them get done around the world. And it's important. It's important because, even though in the end I don't think luxury is going to be a whopping component of our bottom line EBITDA and free cash flow, it's important as a halo effect for our loyalty system and for our most loyal customer who want to be able to travel the road and be the road warrior and ultimately aspire to hit the Conrad in the Maldives or the Waldorf in the Maldives or the Waldorf in Bangkok, resorts and luxury hotels. Whether they use it or not, they want to dream about using it and so it is important and we spend a lot of time on it.","We started standing still 11 years ago. We pretty much had nothing really going on in luxury, a handful of assets you would call luxury. If you fast forward to today, we've worked very diligently with great discipline over time grinding it out organically. And today, with Conrad and Waldorf alone, and I'll talk about other things we're going to do, we have over 100 hotels open or in the pipeline. And that's with having taken some properties out that really don't fit the bill. There is probably a few more of those that over time have to happen, but the net of that will be more adding. The net unit growth in luxury will be positive because we have so many good things going on.","And if you think of about where we've been adding them in Beverly Hills, in Shanghai, in Beijing, in Amsterdam, our deal in London, just announced deal in Miami, another important one coming in the United States and I could go on and on. I think we're making a tremendous amount of progress. We've got 64 open. We've got 38 in the pipeline for both brands. And these are really word class luxury assets that are resonating unbelievably well with our customers. That's why we're having such great growth \u2013 part of the reason we are having great growth in Honors, more Honors occupancy. All of this is connected together.","We have a couple other pistons that will start firing, one soon, the other probably in the next year or two. The one soon is soft luxury. Again, it's not going to be hundreds of hotels. I guess it could be over time. But it will certainly add to the luxury side of business. And then we will eventually do luxury lifestyle. We have chosen not to do it because of other opportunities. And we can only do so much at one time, but ultimately, we will have a luxury lifestyle brand as well. And those two incremental brands, I think, will take what is already a very good story with Waldorf and Conrad and growth and quality of the properties and size of the system and add to it.","If you said to me like in a perfect word, you could just go out tomorrow and fix it, if I could have done that 11 years ago, it would have been a lot easier, but it's not. The practical reality is it's not really possible, because back to my comments on M&A, the things that you could make available don't really funnel through our filtration system. They either have their own problems as a brand or the economics of it would be such that you would destroy a lot of value and so, while we've looked at lots of things, honestly, none of them have made sense. And we are quite confident, I underline confident particularly today after 11 years of hard work and we have really good trajectory on luxury that we're going to a good place that we have enough scale and presence.","It is not only not holding us back but look at the overall network effect we've created. We've got highest average market share across all of our brands of anybody in the industry. So here's the thing, it's working. We got to keep it working, which is what we get paid to do and we will but it's working. And so we will keep grinding it out. And five and 10, not even, over the next three or four years, you'll continue to see some really important hotels and advances in the upper end of the business for us.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. And if I can just follow-up on one other segment, obviously you think it's important enough to look at the all-inclusive segment as it is today based on what you've done, but is that a segment that you could envision broadening across different price levels over time? How big an opportunity do you think that particular segment is or is this just a good to have because it was available to you?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think it's a pretty important segment. I think it's big but it's not gargantuan in the sense that it's only really applicable at the moment in certain micro markets around the world. So I think it's important when we talked to our \u2013 the reason we did the deal with Playa because they're very good at it. And we've had a long relationship there and I've had a long relationship with Bruce. We did a lot of work with our customer base and they said this is something that we want. Again, it wasn't overwhelming like every customer \u2013 but there was enough of our customer base that said they wanted it and you can do it enough places with high quality product that we thought it was important to do.","Whether you do it across a bunch of different price points, I think that's unclear, I mean, I think it's all resorts sort of in the upper upscale, could you go upscale. Possibly at the moment we are really focused more on the upper upscale. We do think there are a bunch of other markets that we are not in that we could do it and I do think it's a decent size opportunity but not, as I said, not a gargantuan opportunity.","And we will look \u2013 currently, we are doing it with sort of as an extension of our core brand at the moment Hilton. We will look at whether as we get into it, if we think there is enough opportunity to sort of create effectively its own presence, create a independent or an extension of the Hilton with a real brand name to it as opposed to just being part of the Hilton system, but it's premature for us to judge that.","We are very pleased with where we are. We think it makes, it adds to our growth, it adds to our profitability and it's one more weapon in our arsenal to please a certain segment of our customers who want to stay there and earn points. And importantly they want to redeem at certain types of resorts and the all-inclusive environment is an environment that enough of our customer says they want that we thought it was important that we were present.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing comments.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, everybody.

Please go ahead.","Jill Slattery","Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. ","We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.","In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today\u2019s call in our earnings Press Release and on our website at www.ir.hilton.com. ","This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company\u2019s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks we will be happy to take your questions.","And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Jill. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019re happy to report another quarter of great results. I think that further demonstrates the strength of our business model and the power of our network effect. Solid net unit growth continued to drive strong bottom line performance with adjusted EBITDA and EPS exceeding our expectations. ","Additionally RevPAR growth outperformed the industry weighted to our chain scales for the sixth consecutive quarter, illustrating that our 17 distinct brands, award winning loyalty program and exceptional customer experience continue to drive robust market share gains. ","Overall our system-wide RevPAR index increased 230 basis points year-to-date with gains across all regions and all brands. System-wide RevPAR grew 1.4% in the second quarter, largely in line with our expectations as our market share gains offset broader choppiness in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. ","Transient RevPAR increased 1.6% on steady business trends and good leisure demand, boosted by the Easter holiday shift. As expected, calendar shifts contributed to softer group performance in the quarter. ","Turning to our outlook, forecast for GDP, non-residential fixed investment and corporate profit growth remain positive, but incrementally a bit lower than previous estimates. Consistent with these trends, we are modestly adjusting our full year RevPAR guidance to 1% to 2%. ","Overall we expect the second half of the year to be similar to the first half with consistent U.S. RevPAR growth and slightly softer international RevPAR growth. We expect continued healthy group business towards the mid-point to high-end of our system-wide range and steady business and leisure transient towards the mid-point of our range. ","Even with slightly lower top-line growth forecast, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year given the significant contribution of net unit growth and strength in other areas of the business. ","Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth ahead of the broader industry as we differentiate ourselves within the lodging space. With an efficient capital-light business model and a disciplined strategy, we continue to fulfill our mission to deliver exceptional experiences at every hotel for every guest, every time. ","Our innovative technology platforms, unique product offering and award winning culture allow us to execute this strategy delivering incremental value to our guests, our owners and our shareholders. ","The strength of our brand portfolio continues to drive owner profitability and therefore greater owner interest. Of the more than 450 hotels we opened in 2018, roughly 75% have already reached a RevPAR index of 100 or greater, with those hotels reaching fair market share within just four months of opening on average. ","For the full year we remain on track for record signings, construction starts and openings. Forecasted signings of more than 110,000 rooms in 2019 would mark our ninth consecutive year of record signings. This supports continued growth in our development pipeline, which we expect to increase in the low to mid-single digits for the full year. Our current pipeline totals approximately 373,000 rooms or over 40% of our existing base. ","Given the strength of our system, we continue to deliver solid growth with deminimus use of our capital. More than 90% of our deals do not require any capital from us, which drives higher net fees. Year-to-date we\u2019ve added more than 200 hotels, totaling 29,000 rooms to our system and continue to expect to deliver 6.5% net unit growth for the full year. ","Overall we believe the greatest development opportunity lies in the mid-market, given the strong secular trends globally driven by an emerging middle-class. We think we are very well positioned to continue delivering impressive growth in the focus service segment given our industry leading RevPAR index premiums. ","During 2019 we expect to celebrate the opening of our 100th Tru hotel, our 500th Homewood Suites, our 850th Hilton Garden Inn, and our 2500th Hampton, demonstrating continued strength across both new and legacy brands. ","Additionally, our New Hilton Garden Inn prototype designed to better meet the needs of our Chinese guests and owners is gaining great momentum and further feeling growth in Asia Pacific. ","We also continue to see impressive momentum in luxury as we execute on an exciting development strategy for the segment. With forecasts to grow our luxury portfolio by over 15% this year, we\u2019re on track to deliver more luxury properties in 2019 than any previous year in our 100 year history. ","Year-to-date we\u2019ve opened four properties, including the highly anticipated Waldorf Astoria Maldives earlier this month. Additionally the Waldorf Astoria Dubai Financial Center opened its stores just a few weeks ago, joining three other Waldorf properties opened in the Middle East with an additional three in the pipeline. ","In the quarter we made several exciting announcements that will continue to further development growth, including the signing of our first Tapestry in the Caribbean, our first Canopy in Africa and the Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos Pedregal in Mexico, which we expect to open later this year.","We were also thrilled to reopen the historic Caribe Hilton in Puerto Rico, following extensive renovations after damage from hurricane Maria. The breadth of our development strategy spanning all regions and brand segments should position us to drive net unit growth for many years to come. ","With rooms under construction accounting for more than half of our total pipeline, we have solid visibility into our growth over the next few years, and with favorable secular trends continued strength in signing and conversions, and no significant brand repositioning, we feel very good about our net unit growth over the long term. ","Our industry leading portfolio is anchored by our award winning Hilton Honors program. An integral part of the overall value proposition to guests, Honors occupancy increased nearly 500 basis points in the quarter to 63%. We now have more than 94 million members, up more than 20% year-over-year with meaningful increases in engagement.","Active members account for more than half of our global members. We are also gaining greater share of wallet from our most loyal guests with a number of elite members up 25% year-over-year in the second quarter and those members reaching 100 nights, up nearly 60% versus the same period last year. ","We\u2019re always looking for ways to better connect with our Honors members and provide increased flexibility and earning and redeeming points. With that in mind, we were thrilled to announce a first of its kind travel and hospitality partnership with rideshare leader Lyft. Members can now earn Honors points when they ride with Lyft and they will have the ability to redeem points in the coming months. ","Whether it\u2019s our partnerships with leaders such as Lyft, Amazon and Live Nation or on property initiatives like Connected Room, we are continually evolving to enable our members to get the most out of the Honors program. ","We recently celebrated our 100th Anniversary, which is a milestone few companies achieve, let alone with the momentum that we have. Throughout our history we\u2019ve introduced numerous innovations, pioneered new travel markets and provided a wide range of career opportunities for our team members. ","We are very proud of all we\u2019ve accomplished over this last century and look forward to continuing to positively influence the world around us in the next century. Overall, with the resilient business model, positive industry growth, a good strategy and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we think we\u2019re very well positioned for the future.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Kevin to give us some more details on our results and our outlook. ","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. In the quarter system-wide RevPAR grew 1.4% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, largely in-line with our expectations. As Chris mentioned, results benefited from market share gains, slightly offset by softer group business and slowing Chinese leisure demand. We estimate calendar shifts tempered system-wide RevPAR growth by roughly 500 basis points. ","Adjusted EBITDA of $618 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range, increasing 11% year-over-year. Our performance was largely driven by better than expected license fees and greater cost control. We estimate roughly $10 million of the beat was due to timing items that will reverse in the back half of the year. ","In the quarter management and franchise fees increased 8% to $591 million, helped by strong net unit growth and other non RevPAR driven fees. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items grew 23% to $1.06 ahead of expectations. ","Turning to our regional performance and outlook, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 1%, driven by increasing market share and solid leisure transient growth, while the Easter shift weighed on group business. For full year 2019 we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in line with our system-wide guidance range, based on positive, but modestly decelerating macro growth. ","In the Americas outside the U.S. second quarter RevPAR grew 3.3% versus the prior year, largely due to strength across South America, which benefited from particularly robust transient demand in Brazil, despite challenging market conditions. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be 3% to 4%. ","RevPAR in Europe grew 5% in the quarter, boosted by strong trends across Continental Europe, and increase leisure demand in London, which benefited from the Cricket World Cup and rising international inbound travel due to favorable exchange rates. ","We expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth in Europe to be above the high-end of our system-wide guidance range, given favorable trends across continental Europe, modestly offset by continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit. ","In the Middle East and Africa region RevPAR was slightly positive in the quarter helped by strong group performance during Ramadan. However supply challenges across the UAE continue to mute leisure transient gains in Egypt, a trend we expect to continue in the back half of the year. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be down in the low single digits. ","In the Asia Pacific region RevPAR increased 2% in the quarter, with a slight RevPAR decline in China, largely due to softening Chinese leisure travel demand, further pressured by the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth for the region to be in-line with system-wide guidance, with RevPAR in China relatively flat, reflecting softer performance in the quarter and a potential continuation of trends. ","Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter we issued $1 billion of senior notes and used $500 million of the proceeds to partially repay our term loans as part of extending that facility for three additional years to 2026. We also amended our revolving credit facility, up sizing that facility to $1.75 billion and reducing our borrowing rate. These financings lengthened our weighted average maturity by nearly two years at a negligible increase to our weighted average cost of debt. ","Moving the guidance, for full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth of 1% to 2% and adjusted EBITDA of $2.28 billion to $2.31 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 9% at the mid-point. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $3.78 to $3.85. ","For the third quarter we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 2%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $610 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.98 to $1.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases.","Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $43 million in dividends. Our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the third quarter. ","Year-to-date we have returned $766 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For 2019 we expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our second quarter results and our latest guidance ranges could be found in the Earnings Release we issued earlier this morning. ","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. ","Chad, can we have our first question please. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Sure. [Operator Instructions] First question today comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Stephen Grambling","Thanks and good morning. Chris you talk about the ongoing market share gains across segments and it looks like you had particularly strong RevPAR in the high-end brands as well as in some of the new brands. How are you anticipating the gains to translate to the pipeline from here and are there any limitations on the absolute number of sign-ups as you expand? And I guess as a quick follow up, are you seeing any shift in the development interest between existing owners versus new?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah, good question and we\u2019re really pleased with the market share gains that we had. I guess you know it would be you know sort of skipping to the end and then I\u2019ll fill it in. It would be hard to be perfectly scientific about translating market share gains into you know impact on pipeline. But rest assured, as you talk to the owner community, what they are trying to do is drive profitability. ","So the higher that our market share in an absolute sense is, the more that we can drive pipeline growth. And I think you know \u2013 so the nuance to that is growth in index is really important, and I think what\u2019s notable about it is that again you know both, in the first quarter, second quarter and year-to-date, the growth in index is across all brands and all regions and importantly as I mentioned a couple quarters ago, we would expect that our international regions will equal or exceed the index in an absolute sense that we have in the U.S., which is a wonderful harbinger of good things to come in terms of incremental growth around the world. ","So that growth in index you know sort of being across the board regionally and by brand is important, but what's equally important is just the absolute market share and I want to you know sort of pause on that for a moment, because what owners are looking for, obviously they want growth, but what they are looking for when they talk to us or any other brand is what is the market share of the brand, and so they are looking at it in an absolute sense. ","You know to use the simple example, if you have a great market share growth off of a very low base, that doesn't necessarily translate into higher pipeline. What translates into the best pipeline growth is highest absolute market share with growth off of that, and so what I think we're most proud of and it\u2019s not by happenstance, it's by strategy is that we have 17 brands, those that have been out and are reasonably mature, are either at the top of the heap or a category killer. There is dog in the bunch. ","So any time we're talking to an owner anywhere in the world about any of our brands, all of the brands are performing at the highest level or above, which is the \u2013 you know which is a very good set of facts for our development teams to be talking to owners as we are working to increase the pipeline. ","So again, I can't say \u2013 I don't have an algorithm that says if we grow share 230 bips it will translate into this much incremental pipeline growth, but rest assured it is a \u2013 there is a very direct connection and I think the market share trends of growth, but equally are more important, the absolute high level of market share across our brand portfolio is going to allow us we think to continue to build the pipeline, build our rooms under construction and ultimately have industry leading that unit growth, because it will continue to attract more capital, because they will be able to make more profit by investing in better performing brands. ","Stephen Grambling","Fair enough and then you had mentioned in your remarks some of the partnerships you've made with the loyalty program. As folks are redeeming or earning points and burning points through some of those, you know should we generally be thinking of those redemptions as being, you know accretive to the system fund and therefore allowing you to reinvest more and kind of drives that Flywheel from a loyalty standpoint, and where are the biggest opportunities I guess from a reinvestment that you see. ","Chris Nassetta","Well, I think \u2013 I mean there are a couple of things. I think the answer is yes, on the margin most of those partnerships involve not all, but most of them involve the partner like in the case of Lyft buying points you know in order to provide points when people who are riding in Lyft, which means it is creating incremental opportunity for Flywheel and reinvestment. ","I think the other way and this is really important when you think about our engagement numbers, which are twice what they were off a much larger base. If you go back six or seven years ago, I think consistent with a lot of others in the industry, our engagement numbers of our loyalty members was probably half of what it is, 25%, 30%. We are now over 50%. Why is that? ","Well there's a whole bunch elements to it, but part of that is getting more engagement out of your high level customers, but let's be honest, you mostly have those people engaged. If they're staying with you 100 or 200 nights a year they are sort of \u2013 they are active and they are engaged. ","What it\u2019s been about is more getting lower level members of Honors engagement while they may not stay as much. They may stay two, three, five night a year and not a 100, that's business right and that's important business and the more that that can be a direct source of business rather than indirect, obviously it adds to our RevPAR premiums and it does so in an incrementally efficient way in terms of distribution costs. ","So one of the things we\u2019ve been very focused on in addition to hitting the highest level of loyalty, which you heard about some, what I think are pretty astounding statistics of you know incremental engagement at the high level is getting lower level engagement and so when you think about, you know our points and money slider, when you think about our you know, we are the only ones that have done, you know shop with Amazon point, you know opportunities for points pulling Lyft, the things that we are doing, I don't want to get ahead of us with Live Nation in terms of ability to use point in a broader context in terms of music opportunity. ","Those are not just about Flywheel and selling points and getting more money in the system, those are about getting lower level members you don't accumulate potentially enough points to go to the Maldives for a week to get engaged with us, because here's the thing we know; the more engagement, the more share of wallet we get. The more that people are using their points and doing things with it that get them active in our system, that get them in our app and get them thinking about us, the more they spend with us. Every guest \u2013 this can be proven scientifically and so the engagement numbers, you know in part are as good as they are because of a bunch of these partnerships. ","You will continue to see more of this from us, both for higher level members and lower level members and it will as I said provide a bit of the Flywheel that you're describing, but I think really what it's focused on is getting greater engagement from our customer base and having more direct relationships.","Stephen Grambling","Super helpful color. Thanks so much. ","Operator","The next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead. ","Harry Curtis","Hey, good morning everybody. Chris, I wanted to focus on some of the factors affecting 2020. This is kind of like putting your projection hat on. As you talk to fellow CEOs, you know in the last couple of quarters we've talked about their level of spend kind of being put on hold at least temporarily because of trade and to what degree is your guidance at least for the back half of this year and in terms of your expectations for next year affected by that, and not only that, but also the political uncertainty? Do you think that there's any at any of that impacting CEOs willingness to spend today? ","Chris Nassetta","Well, answering the second part first, I think the obvious answer is yes. I mean not just you know sort of looking at it scientifically, but you know sort of subjectively you know talking to other CEOs, just talking to friends, anybody you talk to, you know what's going on in the political world which is connected to the trade world which is connected to you know a whole bunch of other things is definitely I think having some impact. ","I think you know I've said this before, I think it means that more people put a caution flag out. It doesn\u2019t mean that they are not doing things, they are spending, they're not hiring, they're not traveling, it just mean they're a little bit more \u2013 they are incrementally more cautious because of what's going on in the broader environment and I think that\u2019s you know absolutely going on. ","Having said that, again it's a caution flag. I would say what I have not seen is like the red flag, which is like all stop. I think people are still you know quietly sort of reasonably optimistic. I think they are carrying ahead and our expectation for the second half of the year and I'll try and answer your 2020 question, although it's way early and it's super subjective at this point. ","But you know for the second half of the year I think our view and as we looked at our forecast was more the same. Like there doesn't seem like, I mean maybe the work in China this week will be will be fruitful I suspect sometime this year. My own personal opinion is there will be a trade deal with China that will settle some of those things down, time will tell. Certainly will I think help with our you know business in China, but time will tell. You know but there are other swirling activities with the political, you know theater ramping up with the 2020 election coming. ","So what we anticipated for the second half of the year honestly is more the same trends. The reason we brought the high end of our guidance down was when we were talking to you a quarter or two quarters ago, honestly comps a bit easier in parts of the world. We thought all things being equal, there was a really good opportunity to see things get a little bit better and when we look at the world right now and sort of trying to do our best to forecast the rest of the year, we look at it and say, no, I think it would be - I think it would be aggressive to say things are going to get better. We think that you know what we try to do in the second half of the year is sort of take the most recent trends and project those out. ","You know that was a big lead up to your answers to your primary question with is 2020. I sort of think about you know we're way early, what do I know, but I think about 2020 and we have to because we're getting ready to go into budget season and all that fun stuff and start to give guidance to our teams around the world. I would say you know my best intel in talking to lots of CEOs and amongst a lot of folks around the world and our teams is that you know I would project out the current trends in to next year. Now is that going to be what happened? Who knows, right. ","I mean, I think they could incrementally get a little better, they could incrementally get where \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s way early to judge, but if you, what you are doing, ask me the question today, how would I think about 2020 sitting here today? I would think about 2020 a lot like I think about the second half of this year, because I don't have enough intel to think otherwise. ","Harry Curtis","Alright, I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks everyone. ","Chris Nassetta","Alright.","Operator","The next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Shaun Kelley","Hi, good morning everyone. Chris, maybe I just want to ask sort of a similar question, but direct it more at unit growth. So obviously we saw you know some \u2013 a very modest amount of sequential growth in the pipeline this quarter, but I think your overall you know view for the full year remains you know pretty steady for pipeline growth. Just what's the commentary out there from developers you know and have you seen any of this corporate softness specifically impact what you are able to do on the signings, your conversion rate or how quickly people are willing to sign deals, and just what\u2019s the activity level out there and what you're able to do from a unit growth perspective? ","Chris Nassetta","Yeah, great, great question and I\u2019ll follow on maybe to you know answer a little bit more of Harry's question as well. ","I mean the short answer is no, we have not seen anywhere in the world at this point sort of a deceleration in the trends and new units in terms of signing, excuse me in fact in terms of starts. We expect both in the U.S. and globally for starts to be up. So our development community, even though if you look at it scientifically, it says the debt markets are tightening a little bit. What our experience would tell us in real time is our developers are getting \u2013 financing more easily, they are getting more work done. So none of that caution flags that I described are in the operating environment we see yet in the development environment. ","Now, depending on what goes on with the economy would stand to reason if, you know if you have a you know protracted period of time where there's a lot of uncertainty, it eventually would seep through. I mean it sort of would be disingenuous to sale right, but we're not seeing it in reality as I said, as our starts are going to be up this year and going to set new records in addition to signings and new unit growth. ","So give that we\u2019ve got a huge pipeline representing 40% of the base, given that we have a very good track record in delivering conversion and more brands to do that, given that you know the more than half of the pipeline is already under construction, I think you know as I said briefly in my prepared comments, I think we have very good visibility into the next few years and I feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver NUG. ","Now sort of a follow on to Harry\u2019s comment, which I'd be remiss in not saying and I knew I'd be given the opportunity to do it, so thank you Shaun. You know reality is, even in an environment where you have reasonably low, some might say anemic same store growth 1% to 2%, you know we are growing our EBITDA 9% or 10% right, and why is that? Because the bulk of the growth in the business for us is really new unit growth and other things like license fees and cobrand and those are performing well and we expect those will continue to perform well. ","So even in a world, you know where we are increasing our guidance, at the same time we took the top and down because the core things that are really driving our growth are performing very well. As I think about next year, its way early to get into it, but you know even in a lower growth same store environment we will do the same thing. I think we will deliver net unit growth comparable to what we are doing this year and we will deliver a comparable kind of result, because the business model is in a post-spin world really is as resilient as we have been saying it is and hopefully quarter-by-quarter as we deliver these results in an environment that has been more choppy and where same store growth has been weaker, but yet we deliver very strong bottom line results that people start to recognize that and understand that that is \u2013 that the business is resilient and we run the business well, which we intend to and continue to do that. ","Shaun Kelley","Thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Thomas Allen ","Hey, good morning. So on Tru I remember when you announced the brand, at the beginning of 2016 and it's impressive that you are now going to open up your 100th hotel this year. As you do more and more work around new brands, do you think there are any other opportunities that could come to a similar size? ","Chris Nassetta","Well, there are definitely other opportunities. We've launched three brands in pretty much the last year. You know we have a couple of things I\u2019ll talk about sort of in the skunk works, one much more advanced than the other. ","Tru is a mega brand in the sense of \u2013 and I've said this many times on this call and when we announced it. I think it'll be our largest brand in the world when it's all said and done. Hampton is today at 2,500 hotels. Reality is Tru is serving a much bigger segment of demand, both here in the U.S. and around the world and while it will take you know decades to get it there and that's the beauty of it. It\u2019s like no investment from us, decades of growth, sort of built in growth, Tru ultimately has the opportunity to be even much bigger than Hampton. ","So that given its serving largest segment of demand, there are brands, one in particular I'll talk about that I think are mega brands, meaning they are hundreds potentially you know over a long period of time, thousands of hotels, but probably none equivalent to Tru to be perfectly honest, just because it's serving 35%, 40% of all demand and is the biggest segment. ","There are a couple of things that we are working on, both in the lifestyle space. One which I think you know is a very large scale opportunity on a global basis, which I would say is sort of upscale lifestyle, you know like a \u2013 I would describe it as sort of a click above Hilton Garden Inn for you know a more urban or mixed use sort of a you know higher end development opportunity. ","I do think you know that that brand has a huge amount of potential in terms of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hotels around the world. We have already soft lunched it with our development community, the reception which we would typically do before a public launch. The reception has been spectacular. We will probably hard launch that sometime in the next six months just as we refine the product and service delivery and bring a number of development deal to the table. ","The other one that we are working on that you know I would say more in the skunk works, less imminent is luxury lifestyle. We\u2019ve talked about it you know for a better part of a decade. We will eventually want and be in that space, but we've been trying to focus on some of these other opportunity that we think as we talked to our customers will drive more engagement, more loyalty and sort of help feed the network effect at a larger scale, but we will eventually get to that. ","So we are not going to be launching three brands every year to be clear. You know I think in the next year we'll probably do one luxury lifestyle at some point in the next couple of years and I'd be remiss in not making this statement. Given that we are in our early days, propagating the breadth and depth of our brands around the world, you know with the list that we have and the two I said, that would be 19 brands. That is plenty of bandwidth for us to keep growing indefinitely, particularly given that we are just getting started with some of these brands in many destinations around the world. ","Thomas Allen ","Helpful, thank you. And then just to challenge you a little bit on the U.S. Rev par comment, so if we look at corporate confidence...","Chris Nassetta","Which comment? ","Thomas Allen ","Just on the consistent, on the outlook of consistent U.S. Rev par growth. I mean corporate confidence keeps on deteriorating. That\u2019s the idea to show that June was the weakest month of Rev par growth we've seen all year. So it feels like Rev par growth in the U.S. is deteriorating when you guys are expecting to be consistent. Can we just reconcile those two things? Like are you seeing stronger group bookings or production or just talk to that a bit. Thanks.","A - Chris Nassetta","I would say two things going on really simply and we'll see whether we are right, but I think they are logical. One, particularly third quarter has a very strong group base. So we were sort of leveraging off of that. ","The second thing is the comps are easier, right. So part of the reason that we thought it would be better was that the comps were easier in the U.S. for a whole bunch of reasons in the second half of the year, so we sort of wiped that out. So between comps being easier and a very strong Q3 group base with most of it already on the books, we feel like the outcome will be very similar. It may be a tick-off. I mean I'm rounding. It may be at tenth or two-tenths off of what we've delivered year-to-date, but we think it'll be you know in that time zone. ","Kevin Jacobs","And Thomas, to June we also swapped the Sunday for a Friday in June this year, which I think has been sort of talked about and people are evaluating the SPR numbers. So if you look at June \u2013 you can look at June and see we made a little bit of an out way. [ Cross Talk]","A - Chris Nassetta","Yeah, and May was really \u2013 April was not that great than June, but May was really strong. So yeah, I wouldn't read too much into June. I mean on the other hand we are definitely saying by bringing our guidance down at the top end overall from a same store point of view that we think the world has \u2013 and I said it in my comment, the world is incrementally a little bit weaker. ","So I'm not \u2013 we're not debating that with you. We just \u2013 as we look at you know forecast in a granular way by property, given the factors that I just described, we think it's going to be similar to what we saw in the U.S. in the first half of the year. ","It's definitely going to be lower in the international if for no other reason \u2013 I mean all \u2013 we had a very strong Europe first half of the year, Continental Europe which we still think will be outperforming the rest of the world, but won't be outperforming as much, and then China in particular which is driving APac, Japan also will be, but China is clearly going to be worse in the second half of the year than the first and so international will be on average less in the second half than the first half, we're pretty confident. ","Thomas Allen ","Really helpful color. Thank you. ","A - Chris Nassetta","Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Joe Greff ","Good morning everybody. One question related to the hotel development, the pipeline. Chris or Kevin, can you give us a sense of maybe what hotel developers are underwriting to in terms of an IRR now say versus a year or two ago. Maybe you can look at it U.S. versus China. And then with respect to signings, to what extent are you getting the increased requests for helping capital to be involved? Thank you. ","Chris Nassetta","Yes, so I don't think people are underwriting you know dramatically different IRRs than they were a year or two ago. I think where people sort of look to change their underwriting is you know what are risk adjusted returns relative to a risk free rate, and the risk free rate has you know moved around a little bit, but hasn't been all that different. So I personally don't think people are under writing to different returns. ","I think they are adjusting their expectations of what their underwriting is going to be going forward and so you see that a little bit you know in terms of the transaction market for existing assets that affects pricing, but in terms of what people are looking forward to take development risks, that's been really consistent. ","And then sorry, the second question, key money. Yeah look, I mean I think you've seen the contract acquisition costs line go up a little bit, which is completely normal for late cycle behavior. When you get later in the cycle, deals get a little bit harder to come together, one. Two, there are more luxury deals that pencil later in the cycle than earlier in the cycle, those at the higher end tend to be the deals that require key money, but that's on the margin and you know I think overall the number of deals in our pipeline that have any contribution from us has remained largely consistent. ","So over the last two years, you know that number is about 10% of the deals than the pipeline has had any contribution from us and that number, that percentage has been pretty consistent for a while. ","Joe Greff ","Thank you. ","Chris Nassetta","Sure.","Operator","The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Carlo Santarelli ","Hey guys, just one quick one and then a quick follow-up. Just in terms of as you guys are thinking about the second half of this year Chris, how much is the U.S. economic activity driving kind of your outlook versus the forward pace that you are kind of looking at right now? And then just more broadly, obviously guys raise your capital return guidance for 2019 in the period. As you think about buyback activity right now, have you altered you know your strategy or stance on capital returns looking ahead at all. ","Chris Nassetta","I\u2019ll let Kevin take the second, I'll take the first. The short answer is, is we look at our forecasting as implied in my prior comments, it's done on a very granular basis. So yes, I mean we have a view of what's going on in the economy, we have a view of you know whether it's going to go up, down or sideways. ","I sort of gave you our view for the moment as sideways, but the bulk of our forecasting with some you know sort of overlay is really based on property by property analysis and looking at the pace of the business and the bookings, and looking at where we \u2013 what we need to fill that would not already be on the books and making an assessment of what we think the probability of being able to do that is. So it is \u2013 I would say it is a much heavier degree of looking at our forward pace and position than it is just a broad overview of here\u2019s what we think the economy is. ","Kevin Jacobs","Yeah.","Carlo Santarelli ","Great, thank you. ","Chris Nassetta","And then Carlo on capital return, the short answer is no, we\u2019ve not changed our outlook on capital return. I think what you are seeing in the range is, we are little bit deeper in the year. Our EBITDA outlook is a little bit higher and so solving for the mid-point of our sort of stated leverage range gets you to a little higher mid-point and we are halfway through the year, so we're tightening the range. And I think the way to think about it is \u2013 the way we've always thought about it, which is we like the stock you know almost at any price. ","We like the outlook for the business model and the returns that we can drive by buying back the stock and so the combination of a modest dividend and then buybacks that are going to be, you know think about recurring free cash flow, plus re-leveraging is coming back no matter what, and we are kind of giving you a range you know of outcomes that could vary depending on how we think of the outlook is for the business, and the price will vary a little bit within the range, but largely we think about capital returning in a really consistent way.","Carlo Santarelli ","Great, thank you both. ","Operator","The next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Anthony Powell","Hello, good morning. I want to focus a bit more in China. You mentioned slower leisure demand that there a few times. Is the demand different in the Tier 1 cities in high end resorts compared to some more moderate Tiers or is it slowed down pretty broad based and maybe some more detail on corporate government and leisure will be great? ","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, so look, I think Anthony it\u2019s been pretty consistent across the board in China. You know I mean over half the business is leisure driven in China and 90% of it is driven in countries. So when you see their economy slowing the way it is and them sort of you know pulling back the reins a little bit on spending, you are going to see that flow through to our business and so, but we really haven't seen. You know you are not seeing sort of the business you know dramatically constructing and the food and beverage being limited the way it had been a couple years ago. I think it's really broadly driven by leisure. ","Chris Nassetta","Business has held up and the group which is a much smaller part of the business there than it is here has actually held up much better than leisure. And you know the other thing not to be \u2013 probably you know because as I said we assumed the current trend to continue in China, that\u2019s what\u2019s built in the forecast. Recognizing we've been through this in China before, to the extent that the trade deal is met, you know the Chinese leisure consumer more than anywhere in the world I've seen can flip around pretty quickly. ","Now if we just you know at this point, this thing has been going on long enough where we said, you know \u2013 we can't forecast that. But reality is, if a trade deal is done, I mean it will take some time to you know sort of flip it around and get back, you know get them back traveling, but I think there's an opportunity for that to happen and for that to be you know a better potential upside at least later in the year. ","But again who knows, you know teams are going next week and it is impossible to know what the result of that will be at this point, so we just assume that that doesn't happen. ","Anthony Powell","Alright, thank you. ","Operator","The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead. ","Robin Farley","Great. I think a lot of my questions have been addressed already, but I did notice that your franchise RevPAR grew better than managed RevPAR in the quarter. Just a little bit different than the overall U.S. trends and wondering if there is anything to call out there? ","Kevin Jacobs","No, I don't think there's anything there Robin. I think that I'm actually not sure what number you're looking at, but I mean at the higher end RevPAR actually performed stronger than you know at the lower end in terms of brands, so nothing to call out there. ","Robin Farley","I was looking at your franchise of 1.6 and managed hotels at 1.3 and that the limited service tend to be more franchise and managed would tend to be more full service, and that's a little bit different than that what we see with.","Kevin Jacobs","Not necessarily \u2013 that\u2019s not necessarily the case in the U.S., so I think that's probably what you're seeing there, is we actually do have a higher level of managed franchise of full service hotels in the U.S. so there is nothing to extrapolate there. ","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Bill Crow","Hey, good morning. Chris I've got a two-parter on capital, capital commitments. And the first one really goes back to your press release over the past week about growing your luxury brands and the footprint in it. It seems to me with 94 million Honors members and the engagement statistics, all the positive momentum you have there, it's a dramatic mismatch with the really limited number of luxury options they have to use their points and I'm just wondering why it took so long to kind of reinvigorate the growth in luxury and whether you thought about putting more of your own capital in to get a quicker growth in that segment. ","Chris Nassetta","I appreciate the question. I read you\u2019re not on Sunday Bill. I don't agree with it entirely, but here's what I would say. The Press Release was obviously about sort of pounding our chest about a bunch of cool new hotels that are opening up. Since the day I walked in the door of this company, 12 years ago, we have been focused on luxury. This isn't something that we finally, as you describe, not me, you know we finally decided to focus on luxury. We\u2019ve been \u2013 it takes a long time to make any of these deals happen, and so we've been very focused on it for two fundamental reasons. ","The first is some of our customers want it, right. I mean a lot of our \u2013 you know at different times. The second is for loyalty to have it in the system from an aspirational point of view, we think it's important, so we spent a lot of time on it. ","What I would say objectively is we've made incredible progress. We went from basically nothing 10 or 12 years ago to having open or in the pipeline 110 incredible luxury hotels. I'd say at this point, while we have a lot more we want to do, we have captured most of the most important urban and resort markets. We do have some gaps. We're working very hard at filling those gaps, but we are making tremendous progress, and yes on occasion we are using our balance sheet. ","If you look at the amount of sort of outstanding key money commitments we have, it would weigh disproportionately to luxury for that very reason. But I would say, and you said it, Bill it implied in your question, it\u2019s obviously what we're doing is working, right, because I'd say we have the market leading statistics in loyalty, not to be defensive. I mean the growth rate in our loyalty program, engagement rate, level of Honors occupancy is working, right and so there's a whole bunch of reasons for that. ","One the luxury strategy is I think working; two, what you have to remember is while people aspire to go to the Maldives and do all these things, that\u2019s not actually what they do with their behavior, right. What they do more than not, is use it for the mundane things in life like going to you know New York City for the weekend with their husband or wife or going to a Reading, Pennsylvania for a soccer tournament with their kids and using the point they earned traveling on business to satisfy their needs and their personal likes. That is what they \u2013 you know if you look at the behavior. ","And so when you think about it, think about it this way, like we are not a start-up. We have 6,000 hotels that people can redeem at in 115 countries around the globe, right. That can satisfy a lot of needs. We have a 110 open or pipeline luxury, we have almost 200 great resorts around the world. If you look at the upper end of upper upscale with all respect to some most of our competitors who would call that luxury and we don't. So take the upper-end of the Hilton brand, that's probably another 150 or 200 hotels. ","So in reality, out of the 6,000 hotels we have 400 or 500 of them sort of by a broader categorization of sort of luxury in resort would meet those needs, in addition to the other 5,500 that meet most of their everyday needs. And so we're focused on luxury, we're making great progress. If you went and saw any of the newer luxury Waldorfs or Conrads that have opened, I\u2019d encourage it. I think you would be really impressed, but it is a broad sort of network effect that we are creating to allow loyalty members to get a great value proposition. ","Luxury is part of it, but it is not all of it. It is \u2013 and I would argue honestly as reflected in our numbers, I would argue while it's important, it's a relatively small part of it in terms of the other parts of the ecosystem that help drive loyalty. ","Bill Crow","That's a thorough and satisfying answer. So I appreciate it. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks Chris. ","Chris Nassetta","Alright, we\u2019ll debate it offline. ","Bill Crow","Yeah, you got it. ","Chris Nassetta","Alright. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Donnelly ","I guess, maybe two follow-ups if I could. One, this one is guess for Kevin. Looking to 2020, how realistic is it to expect much growth in the $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion capital return. There is certainly incremental cash flow, but pipeline and RevPAR growth slowing a bit. I'm wondering how that shapes, how you think about the structure of repurchase activity or capital return next year? ","Kevin Jacobs","Well, hey look Jeff it's early, so I should probably do the responsible thing and say it's a little bit early to be giving you know sort of capital return guidance. But if you think about it, I mean Chris said earlier in the call, our model is a lot less dependent on same store sales growth today and much more pipeline dependent. Our pipeline growth for the record is not slowing and we do not think our net unit growth is slowing. ","So thus, those hotels will enter the system, they'll pay fees. Our free cash flow \u2013 you ought to assume that our free cash flow will grow slightly and will continue to re-leverage the business, and so our capital available to return to shareholders ought to look you know very similar or slightly higher than it does this year. ","Chris Nassetta","Yep, I agree. Keeping in perspective one technical thing and then a broader view, every point in same store RevPAR assumption has the impact of being where it\u2019s about $10 million to $12 million of free cash flow. So in the end it does not move the needle on that and the way to \u2013 I think on a broad base we\u2019ve sort of covered this, but it's probably worth covering again to make sure we are abundantly clear. ","On return of capital, I would say and share buyback, we put it in three buckets. One, free cash flow. You should assume that we are every year always on deploying our free cash flow to do our minor dividend which we don't intend to increase and then you just all the rest of that to buy back stock. ","You should also assume as we continue to grow EBITDA with this resilient model that in the normal everyday sort of approach will be to re-lever, to sort of you know circle the mid-point of our 3 to 3.5 range. If you look at the financing transactions we just did, where does it take us for the year, 3.25, shocking and that gets it for the 1.5 the 1.8. ","There is also an opportunity which I\u2019ve talked about, the potentially for short periods of time to lever the company up even more highly beyond that you know for a period of time and then de-lever and accelerate repurchases and what I would say is that sort of the more opportunistic side of it, we did it a little bit with H&A, but that would be an environment where we saw a major dislocation occur and we wanted to take advantage of that major dislocation. ","So I think every day in and day out you ought to think about our buyback, like what we are doing this year, use all our free cash flow and re-lever to a relatively conservative level and buyback stock. ","Going beyond that, if there's a big dislocation, I think you know we would certainly consider. You know it\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about around our board table, and won\u2019t have to decide the time the lever-up incrementally for a period of time, because the free cash flow obviously would allow you to lever down, and to take advantage of dislocations in the market. But it's sort of in those three buckets, two of which you are experiencing this year, the third of which obviously doesn't look likely.","Jeff Donnelly ","And Chris, now I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but what's the path to getting to the top end of year 1% to 2% annual guidance and RevPAR, because if you are facing tough comps internationally in the back half of the year, and like you said, let\u2019s assume steady U.S. growth, it just feels like the acceleration you would need in the second half of the year, because this is just unlikely to kind of pull your first half of the year up that much if you will?","Chris Nassetta","Yeah, I mean I think as I always do, that we\u2019ll end up somewhere in the middle, right. I mean we narrowed the range. We are usually at two point range, we narrowed it to one, because I think you know who knows, you can't \u2013 we don't have a crystal ball. Reality is, you should assume as you always should that the middle of the range is what we think will really happen. ","Could it get the two? I mean we looked at scenarios where it could. Do I think it's likely? No. I mean what would have to happen? The U.S. would have to you know pick up a little bit. You\u2019d have to have the choppiness, particularly in business transient sort of stabilize. The group is going to perform because it mostly on the book. You\u2019d have to sort of have the caution flags pulled back in in the U.S. ","Is that possible? Sure. You can get a trade deal done with China, people could feel a little bit better, you know people could start spending a little bit more, traveling, and so it's not impossible. I mean it is possible to get to the two. In our view it was not really possible to get to the three, which is why we took it off the table. I think it is possible. ","The other things that would contribute to it would be you know China. China, while it's not a huge part of our overall system, you know it was growing at a much, much higher level. So it\u2019s going too flat or modestly down does have some impact. So if you said the U.S. you know stiffened up a little bit and people took a few caution flags in. China flipped around with a trade deal, could you be in to? Yeah.","Do I think we will? No I think we will be around 1.5, that's why we gave a range and you know trying to tighten a range more than point when we are halfway through the year, just you know to be honest just didn\u2019t feel prudent. ","Jeff Donnelly ","Great, thanks guys. ","Chris Nassetta","Yep.","Operator","The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi Group. Please go ahead. ","Smedes Rose","Hi, thank you. You\u2019ve gotten to most of them, but I just wanted to ask you. You noted your strength and focus on the mid-market segment and you know we continued to see Tru put up the outsized RevPAR gains relative to other \u2013 your other brands in that segment. I\u2019m just wondering, do you think any of the growth there is coming at the expense of Hampton Inn or do you think it's more just the expansion of footprint and the brand containing to gain traction. ","Chris Nassetta","No, I don\u2019t. I mean you can't say that they don't compete in some markets at all, but it is really a different segment, that's how we designed it. We spent a lot of time on that and how we think about the go-to-market commercial strategy is to keep it in its swim lane. I think why Tru is gaining, and if you look at it Hampton is gaining share too. So Hampton is not, like you're not seeing, Tur go up and Hampton go down, Hampton\u2019s gaining share, and Hampton is the highest average market share brand that we have. So it is both an absolute sense and a growth sense performing at an incredibly high level. ","Why Tru I think is doing well, is honestly to think about that segment, no offense to everybody else out there. You know the reason we launched Tru is because we didn't think anybody in that segment was doing it well. We didn't think that there was at scale a brand that delivered a good product, consistent, clean with simple service delivery that resonated with customers and I think what we're finding is we were right. Right the customers are flocking to Tru because it's just a better, newer, cleaner product and what it\u2019s taking share from is folks in that competitive set. ","Smedes Rose","Okay, thanks. And then Chris when you just look back at prior cycles, you know let's say the U.S. economy does take a little bit more of a down shift. I mean when developers are looking to access capital, do banks or lenders, are they more likely to require the development fee within a major brands system like your own? I mean do you see relative gains within maybe the smaller overall development pipeline? ","Chris Nassetta","There is no question that that\u2019s the case. Frankly to me I think we've been a huge beneficiary of that even in the last two or three years as lending standards have tightened. I think we are \u2013 I mean I know it's me pounding, you know pat myself and Hilton on the back, we are more financeable. I mean just go talk to a dozen lending institutions and ask them their view. Why? Because we drive system wide better market share. We drive better profitability, easier to underwrite, less risky, we've been doing this 100 years and so yes, we are already taking an unfair share amount of development. In an environment that\u2019s gets worse I think our sheer numbers go up, you know they are they always have and I think they will, as long as we continue to drive the market share premiums that we are."," ","Smedes Rose"," ","Great. Thank you."," ","Operator"," ","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over the Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks."," ","Chris Nassetta"," ","Thanks everybody. As always we appreciate you taking the time. We'll look forward to talking with you after the third quarter and hope everybody enjoys the rest of your summer. Get some time to relax and be with friends and family.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you. Denise. Welcome to Hilton's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the risk factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call.","You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at IR.Hilton.com. Unless otherwise noted comparisons to the company's second quarter 2016 results assume that the spinoff transactions had occurred on January 1, 2016. Please see our earnings release for additional details.","This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report our second quarter as the new Hilton, and I think our results continue to demonstrate the strength of our fee-driven business model. It starts with the best performing portfolio of brands in the business, which are driving record organic unit growth with minimal investment. Add to that, solid same-store growth driven by positive industry fundamentals, and you end up with significant and growing free cash flow, all of which we intend to return to shareholders.","Turning specifically to results, we reported adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance for the second quarter, and we're also raising our expectations for the full year including our outlook for capital return. We now expect to return $1 billion to $1.1 billion to shareholders this year, or over 5% of our market cap. Our RevPAR index premium increased 60 basis points in the quarter with positive growth in every brand segment and in every region. Top-line results in the quarter were generally as expected with system-wide RevPAR growth of 1.8%. Netting the benefit of July 4th and the downward pressure from Easter, calendar shifts weighed on results by approximately 70 basis points.","When you boil it all down, system-wide year-to-date transient and group growth have generally been consistent with our expectations with business transient and group towards the midpoint of our guidance range, and leisure transient a bit above the high end. Looking forward, expectations for macro indicators such as GDP growth and non-residential fixed investment growth suggest continued improvement. But so far, we have not seen that translate into increased demand. As a result, our forecast would suggest the midpoint of our RevPAR range for the full year.","On unit growth, we continue to drive a disproportionate share of global development to our system. Nearly one in every four rooms under construction around the world are slated to be added to our system, and we continue to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific than anyone. In the second quarter, we opened more than 13,000 net managed and franchised rooms, and remain on track to deliver roughly 6.5% net unit growth for the full year. We also approved over 27,000 rooms in the quarter, well on our way to achieving more than 100,000 rooms approved for the full year.","Our pipeline totals over 330,000 rooms, up roughly 15% year-over-year, and represents more than 40% of our existing supply. With over half of our pipeline under construction, we have good visibility into unit growth over the next several years.","We continue to make great progress on our luxury development strategy. We had a very positive response to the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills opening just last month. This opening marks Waldorf Astoria's West Coast expansion, offering global travelers a new standard of luxury in one of California's most prestigious ZIP Codes. We expect this spectacular property, along with other recent openings, like the Conrad Osaka, the Conrad Guangzhou, the Conrad San Luis Potosi, and upcoming openings like the Conrad Fort Lauderdale, the Waldorf Astoria Chengdu, and a soon to be announced luxury hotel in Midtown Manhattan to drive a nearly 15% increase in our luxury distribution in this year alone. And we expect to continue seeing double digit luxury growth for the next several years.","Our newest brands also continue to perform very well. Home2 Suites celebrated its 150th opening in the second quarter, with its 200th opening expected by year-end. With nearly 400 hotels in the pipeline, Home2 continues to have the largest pipeline of any suites brand. Guests love Home2's product and service offering, and owners love its performance. In the quarter, the brand increased its RevPAR index by over 500 basis points, and Home2, barely six years since launch, already runs RevPAR premiums well above our system average.","Tru by Hilton opened its first three hotels in the second quarter, with the first marking our 5,000th hotel. By year-end, we expect to have ten Tru hotels opened, with construction starts on an incremental 5,000 Tru rooms. We believe that Tru will attract new customers into our system and enable us to enter new markets. To-date, nearly one in five of our signed Tru deals are in cities where our current brands are not present.","In the quarter Tapestry Collection opened its first property, the Hotel Skyler. This unique eco-friendly hotel is a former temple located in the heart of Syracuse, New York, and is only one of 11 LEED Platinum certified hotels in the world. The property perfectly illustrates the spirit of our Collection brands, which allows hotels to maintain their unique identity while benefiting from the strength of our commercial engines.","Both of our Collection brands, Curio and now Tapestry, continue to gain momentum across the U.S. and globally. With nearly 150 hotels opened and in development, we are quickly growing our system without increasing overall industry supply. Curio celebrated some important developments over the last few months, including debuting properties in China, France, and Italy. We also welcomed the world renowned Hotel del Coronado to our Curio Collection. This iconic 130-year-old property is a great addition to our growing portfolio of unique hotels and resorts.","We look forward to unveiling additional Collection properties in Costa Rica, the Florida Keys, Paris, and London later this year.","On the innovation front, we've begun deploying our industry-leading digital key outside the United States, and remain on track to have over 2,500 hotels, or nearly half our system, equipped with this guest-centric capability by year-end. Hilton Honors members continue to set new records for usage and engagement through our app, with over 3.5 million digital check-ins and nearly 1 million room keys downloaded in the quarter alone. Guests love the choice and control that the Honors app enables, as seen in guest satisfaction scores that increase on average 400 basis points when guests use our digital key.","Innovations like the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth in Honors. Year-to-date, 5.5 million people have joined the club, a 20% increase year-over-year, and we had our first month with over 1 million enrollments in the quarter. Hilton Honors occupancy increased 170 basis points versus the prior year, while paid member folio rose 9% year-over-year to $5 billion in the quarter, a system record. With the most guest-centric loyalty program and the efficiency of our web direct channels, guests benefit from greater personalization and more choice and control and best value. At the same time, owners benefit from lower distribution costs and continued increases in system RevPAR premiums.","To further Hilton Honors' ability to drive demand to our system, we recently announced our partnership with American Express, which we believe is a big win for both companies, and for all stakeholders. Effective January next year, Amex will launch and aggressively market a refreshed portfolio of Hilton Honors credit cards in the United States that will help grow our Hilton Honors membership and deepen member engagement.","We will also have the opportunity to grow transient and group market share at favorable economics through American Express and its travel assets, as well as provide owners a meaningful reduction in merchant fees. For Hilton, the growth of card spend in this partnership should benefit license fee growth. We expect all license fees, including co-brand and HGV, as a percentage of total fees to be around 11% this year and would expect for that to go up around 200 basis points in 2018 and grow in line to above core fee growth going forward.","Lastly, I'd like to share some recent news that we're very proud of, and to thank many of our team members whose efforts led to these achievements. Hilton was named the number one military friendly company for 2017 by both GI Jobs and Military Spouse magazines. We owe this honor in large part to our commitment to Operation: Opportunity. Through this initiative, we've hired more than 10,000 veterans and spouses over the last four years, and we just recently have committed to hiring another 20,000 by the end of 2020.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for further details on the results and our outlook. Kevin?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.8% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis due to strong leisure demand and international results. Year-to date, which largely neutralizes for holiday shifts, RevPAR growth is up 2.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA of $519 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $9 million, largely driven by better than expected fee growth and out-performance in owned and leased hotels.","Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.52, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and increasing 30% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. In the quarter, management franchise fees grew nearly 11% versus the prior year to $513 million, well ahead of our 7% to 9% guidance range. In addition to timing related items, greater license and incentive management fees drove outperformance in the fee segment, while transient occupancy gains in London and rate gains in Japan led to solid results in our owned and leased portfolio.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook, we believe our broad geographic diversity continues to lower the effects of volatility in individual markets. In the U.S. comparable RevPAR increased 50 basis points driven by good leisure transient trends and somewhat offset by softer group performance due to the Easter shift. Additionally, weakness in oil and gas markets pressured results in the quarter. For full year 2017, we continue to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth towards the lower half of our 1% to 3% system-wide range.","In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR grew a solid 6.5% versus the prior year due to strength in Mexico and Canada, which was driven by strong transient demand in both regions. Leisure transient in particular saw double digit RevPAR growth across the region. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region at the higher end of our guidance range. RevPAR in Europe also grew 6.5% in the quarter, ahead of expectations due to transient strength in London and Continental Europe, namely the Netherlands, Germany and Spain. Additionally, international inbound to the UK was up nearly 14% in the second quarter, helped by favorable exchange rates. Given the beat coupled with raised expectations for the balance of the year, we expect full year 2017 RevPAR growth in the region to be in the mid-single digits.","In Middle East and Africa, robust second quarter RevPAR growth of 10% benefited from stronger leisure volume largely due to holiday shifts which should reverse in the third quarter. We saw good group performance in Saudi Arabia, transient strength in the UAE and improving leisure business in Egypt. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region of flat to slightly positive.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 7% in the quarter led by strength in Japan and China. RevPAR in China was boosted by stronger transient volume at both established and maturing assets. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth for the region to be mid-single digits with RevPAR in China up in the 8% to 9% range.","Moving on to capital return, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the quarter for a total of $98 million in dividends paid year-to-date. Our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the third quarter.","As Chris mentioned, we now expect to return between $1 billion and $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends this year. Since initiating buybacks in March, we have bought $425 million of shares through July and expect to buy a similar incremental amount by year-end.","With the resiliency of our business model, a point of RevPAR growth is about a point of adjusted EBITDA growth, making it largely immaterial to our capital return potential.","For the third quarter of 2017, as expected, an unfavorable calendar shift in the days of week for July 4th and the timing of the Jewish holidays which fell in the fourth quarter last year should result in system-wide RevPAR growth of 0% to 2%.","We expect adjusted EBITDA of $490 million to $510 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.47 to $0.51. We are maintaining our full year 2017 RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3%. As Chris mentioned, we expect full year growth towards the midpoint of the range.","We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $20 million to $1.9 billion at the midpoint. Even with relatively modest same-store RevPAR growth, we expect to grow 2017 adjusted EBITDA by 7% to 9%, or roughly 4 times the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance, demonstrating the strength of our fee-based business model.","We are raising diluted EPS adjusted for special items to $1.78 to $1.85. Please do note that our full year EPS range does not incorporate incremental share repurchases.","Further details on our second quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.","Lastly, we were recently added to the S&P 500, an index widely regarded as the best gauge for high quality large cap U.S. equities. We view this as a great milestone for our company and are proud to be part of this prestigious group of companies.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Jacobs. And your first question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Harry.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Chris, good morning. Chris, based on your relationships at the highest levels with your key customers, what are the economic and political tea leaves that they need to see before dialing up spending on transient travel?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's the $64,000 question. A good one. I'd say \u2013 I've been talking to a lot of our corporate customers actually in the last couple of months, and I would say people are, sort of, cautiously optimistic in the sense that they see the economy as continuing to show decent resiliency, obviously positive growth.","I think, everybody would like to see a little bit more clarity on public policy on some of the things that they care about the most to unleash a little bit more optimism in the hiring, spending and consequently demand for hotel room nights. I think, this \u2013 probably the single biggest thing that might help change the psychology with our corporate customers is some positive movement in the area of tax reform. I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff going on politically right now, and legislatively, all of which can matter, regulatory change certainly could matter. But I think tax reform is probably singly the thing that I hear about most from people, simply because I think people have wanted it a long time. The impact of it would be positive in the sense of driving more free cash flow into people's businesses, so they'd have more to play with to hire and invest. And so I'd say \u2013 I would say probably that, although not only that.","But generally as I talk to corporate customers as we think about the rest of this year, and particularly into next year, as I said, they're sort of cautiously optimistic. I'd say their attitude has been business is pretty good, growth is okay, we'd like it to be better. As they think about going into next year, their travel spend. I think, people generally view that their budgets are going to be going up, I think probably, with the U.S. as a surrogate for the moment, probably, you know, volumes that are relatively stable with rates that are going up some.","I think people, even though they're cautious, understand that they're going to have increases inflationary plus kind of increases next year. But at the moment, I'd say people generally are looking at travel budgets that, in the corporate side, that are going to be higher next year. The question is, how much higher, and I think that gets back to seeing what happens with the broader economy as a result of some of the things that are going on in the political world.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. Chris, you talked a little bit about the partnership and the January 1, 2018 launch. I don't know if you guys could provide any color, but I believe there was at least some influence from this transaction that we saw in the 2Q. And I just wanted to maybe briefly cover that. And then if I could just get some clarity on the license fees? I think, you called out 11% of total fees in 2017 going to 13% in 2018. Is that off an assumed 2018 fee number, or is that kind of off of a stable base and the mix just goes up by 200 basis points?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I mean, I think the way to \u2013 I'm taking the second one first, assume a sort of normalized rate of growth on fees. You can go back to what we gave you last year at the end of the year at the Analyst Day and then take the percentage of that. I mean, basically we're saying it's a 200 basis point increase. That's not all the co-brand relationship here or with other co-brand relationships we have around the world, it's some HGV as well. We sort of put it in the \u2013 all of it in the bucket together. But largely that \u2013 and the largest part of that increase that you'd see is being driven by the co-brand relationship.","In Q2, there was a modest benefit even though the deal really doesn't go fully live till January of next year with the new cards and all that. There are elements of it that did go retroactively live to the beginning of this year in terms of what they pay for points and things. And that \u2013 as a result of signing it in the second quarter, there was a bit of a catchup that did have a modest benefit in license fees in Q2.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then if I missed it, I apologize, but in terms of your outlook on group for the back half of the year and kind of pacing, is there anything notable that shifted from your commentary post the 1Q?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I wouldn't say anything meaningful. You did not miss it, we didn't talk about it. I was fairly confident we would get asked in Q&A, so I decided I'd leave the group commentary for Q&A. Here's how I would describe group overall, so that \u2013 to answer your question. It is weaker in the second half of the year than it was in the first half. That was fully expected from the beginning of when we started budgeting last year just for a whole bunch of reasons in terms of how the groups are cycling through.","That is almost entirely driven by Q3 being weaker. There are a couple \u2013 you know, a few things going on there. The 4th of July hurts a lot the beginning of the third quarter just because basically it became a week of no business, no group travel. The shift in the Jewish holidays between September and October, it has a big impact on group in the third quarter. The pace in Q2 into Q3 was a bit weaker. Having said that, the fourth quarter is quite strong on the group side. Actually, the pace in Q2 for Q4 was up. So it really is sort of a \u2013 from everything we're seeing sort of a Q3 phenomena that's driving the second half of the year.","If we look at sort of position this year and then look at position going into next year, position for group going into next year is still meaningfully above the position that we see for this year at this point.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, Chris. Thank you so much.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","The next question will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Chris, Kevin, do you think U.S. RevPAR grows in the 3Q similarly to what you experienced in the 2Q? Or does it take a little bit of a lay down just given some of the calendar shifts that you referred to?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, that's a really good question, and we've got a bunch of incoming calls this morning on sort of Q2 being 0.5 in the U.S. I think, it requires some context before I answer, and that is there is a lot of crazy stuff going on with calendar, day of week and holiday shifts this year, more than the average. And so if you look at the numbers which we obviously have done and you sort of cleanse the whole year of all these holiday shifts between Easter, 4th of July, the Jewish holidays, and some other things that are lesser impactful, but nonetheless are impacting the results. What actually is happening is, first of all, first half versus second half is roughly the same, although believe it or not second half is better in the U.S. than the first half when you cleanse it for all those things. And if you look at it quarter-by-quarter, the weakest quarters are the first quarter and the third quarter, and the strongest are the second quarter and the fourth quarter.","So when you cleanse it for the holiday shift, Q2 was better than Q1. I mean, I gave you the number in my prepared comments that we had a 70 basis point sort of net impact of 4th of July and Easter. If you relate that to the U.S., call it a point, you know, a point impact means that roughly the U.S. would have been in Q2 net of all that. about 1.5 points. If you do the same sort of math in Q1, it's a bit less than a point.","So I think what's going on, when I net all of that out, when I look at the data, sort of, like \u2013 and this is what I would hope you guys would want to hear from me, sort of, is there anything like big movements that are going on? I think that all these holiday shifts are creating the appearance that there's a bunch of big stuff going on. I think, there isn't. In my opinion what's going on is sort of steady as she goes. That's what I said with our team. As you look at \u2013 I mean, there are some ups and downs quarter-by-quarter even when you cleanse it, but the bottom line on the business right now is you've got business transient that is growing, but not with as much strength as we would like. Sort of to the low to the midpoint of our guidance range. You have group that's sort of been towards the midpoint of the range, and you've had leisure transient that's been sort of at the high end. You've had relative strength there.","And while I can pick month-to-month, a little bit here and there, you know, when you really sort of look through it all, that's what's going on. That sort of shouldn't be surprising to anybody given what's going on with the broader economy, certainly here in the U.S. I mean, out around the world, we \u2013 Kevin covered a bunch of the stats. Very different setup. But still, 72% of our business is here in the U.S. so it's driving the bulk of the result. It's pretty much steady as she goes, and it's a consequence of broader economic growth that is positive, but not particularly robust.","And so my expectation as I \u2013 we sifted through data, studying every number known to man, obviously getting ready for today, is you're sort of in that range. We targeted the midpoint of our range because that's what our forecast is. I feel pretty confident of that. But you're sort of in that 1% to 3% range until something happens, a la Harry Curtis's first question about what has to happen to make corporates feel better. There needs to be something else to happen to sort of get you out of that range. And until then, we're in that range.","Now, the good news story for us is we can be in the middle of that range at 2%, you can add 6% to 7% new unit growth, and we're driving bottom line growth of 7% to 9% in what is, from a same store point of view, fine and good and stable. By the way as I said, I don't \u2013 I wouldn't read too much into these quarter-to-quarter shifts because I view it as pretty stable, but we're taking a relatively sort of modest growth environment and creating, I think, a darn good result on the bottom line in terms of growing EBITDA and growing cash flow as a consequence of the resiliency of this model.","But, I think, it's important \u2013 that's a longer answer than I know you wanted, but I think it's important context because I think it's easy to get \u2013 and you only have the data that you get, it's easy to get caught up in these big shifts that are going on quarter to quarter. If you cleanse it, there's really not that much going on quarter to quarter.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. And then one quick question for Kevin. You increased your guidance for cash available for capital return. What \u2013 I mean, I know it's not an enormous change, but what drove that upward move?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. There's a little bit \u2013 obviously a little bit...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","10%.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. 10% is pretty good. A little bit of it, of course, was the upward revision of the EBITDA guide, Joe. Of course, a little bit of it is just refining our forecast as we're halfway through the year and we're thinking about our cash uses for the balance of the year. A little bit of lower cash taxes, and there was a little bit of \u2013 there was a modest incentive baked into the co-brand card deal that we signed that came through in the second quarter, which helped in that $100 million.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. And the 3Q and 4Q, do you have incrementally more license fees coming from the credit card deal, or is it \u2013 what's in the full year is just related to the 2Q?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No. We had a bit of a catch up. It's built into the numbers we've given you. We had a bit of a catch-up in Q2 which I talked about because it went retro to January 1, and then we built \u2013 everything else is built into Q3 and Q4 guidance \u2013 or Q3 and full year guidance that we gave you.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you so much, guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Shaun.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Chris, maybe just stick with the same thing on the U.S. RevPAR performances. Kind of a two-part question, but I guess, the first one, because I think \u2013 a number of investors are just wondering directly, do you think there's any chance or risk that Q3 RevPAR in the U.S. could dip to negative? Or do you think we still stick in positive territory despite all the calendar shifts? Not to hold you to a specific number, but I think people are a little bit worried about the headline there. And then maybe...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Well, okay. You want me to...","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, go ahead.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I'll tackle that one, and then you can keep going. I'd say Q3 as reported, I think, will be positive, although it will be in the \u2013 it will be low. If you cleanse it again for the holiday shift things that I'm saying, in my opinion, it's clearly positive.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for that. I think that's helpful for folks. And then the second part would just be, when we look at the brand breakdown a little bit, it doesn't look like some of the more midscale and upscale brands were some of the contributors to that lower RevPAR performance. And again, we're not getting those brands domestically, so it's not going to be a perfect comp for us. But can you just give us a sense of any fears or question marks you might have around new supply growth that you're seeing in some of those chain scales in particular? And could that be dragging down our RevPAR performance? Or do you not think that that's a particular impact right now?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's \u2013 it's a good question. The honest answer, I mean, we've obviously looked \u2013 the honest answer is there is more supply coming there than you are seeing in the other segments. So logically, there has to be a bit of impact there. Although that, I would say \u2013 we've studied it like all these things quite carefully, and I don't think that's the majority of what has caused the RevPAR growth in some of those brands to be at the lower end of what we're reporting.","I think it has a lot to do with some other things. First, keep in perspective that all of those brands are category killers. So they start life at a much higher absolute RevPAR level than almost all their competition. So when you look at absolute growth in RevPAR, not relative percentage growth, they're performing just fine. They're just starting in some of these cases over 120% market share to begin with, competing against a lot of brands that are a lot lower than that. So it is a mathematic \u2013 sort of, a math thing.","There's also honestly some oil patch issues, if you look at those brands. In the first quarter, you saw a little bit better performance in the oil patch than you did in the second quarter, a little bit more impact again in the oil patches, which are not just a couple of places. And those brands would be disproportionately a little bit more hit by that.","And then probably last, again it's sort of a combo platter of all these things. In the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter really, it was driven by a lot of leisure strength. Just given what was going on with the shift in the 4th of July and the Easter holidays meant that it was much more leisure-dependent. And some of those brands, particularly like a Hilton Garden Inn in its segment is not as much a leisure brand as it is business travel, serving business travelers. So in an environment where it's heavy leisure orientation because of those holiday shifts and otherwise, it will have some impact on the performance.","So, again, those brands are \u2013 each of those that you're looking at are category killers. If you went out and talked to the development community, they lead their respective segments, or are way above any of the competition. And so I think, they're performing, they're performing just fine. Q2 a bunch of things, as I just described, sort of, causing it.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","On the credit, morning. On the credit card program, can you remind us if you can what will ultimately drive the growth in the fees from this going forward? Is that the number of members signing up for it? Is it the usage? The profitability? And did that change versus the prior agreement?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","It's a little, it's \u2013 you're going to get tired of hearing me say this, I guess, but it's a little bit everything. It's \u2013 if you think about the system that we had before, we had a dual-branded system. We had two major providers. It meant that it was far from optimized in terms of spend. We think there's a huge amount of upside in getting not only more people in, but honestly, just incremental spend in the system. And that's going to drive a lot of it. Obviously, the margins that we can't get into in detail for reasons of our agreements with Amex, but we negotiated better margins, obviously that benefit license fees, that obviously predominantly benefits the system. The largest part of the economic benefit of this transaction is going back into the system in a whole bunch of different ways that benefit customers and that benefit our ownership community. But it's all, it's a combo of those. We're going to get people \u2013 more people in. They're going to spend more. And we've got a better margin in our negotiations with Amex.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then changing gears a bit. We've seen more press releases on the changes to the cancellation policies from some of your peers. And I know you've been testing various things there. Where are you in fine-tuning the cancellation policy? And how do you think about the potential financial ramifications?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. You obviously saw it because it became public that we went to a 48-hour policy that will get instituted \u2013 that will get rolled out next week. We announced it to our owners a month ago. And in select markets, 10 or 20 markets around the country, we'll go to 72 hours where we think it's appropriate. The reasons I think are obvious for why we're doing that. Not just because of new technologies, but just because customers, many of them, ultimately have been trained to do multiple bookings and do things that have created a scenario where cancellations have, in some markets, skyrocketed. They've got, they've gone way up.","And it makes it \u2013 it's not good for anybody. It makes it very hard for us to manage inventory, particularly close-in inventory in a way that makes sense. And the net result of that is it costs everybody, because if we can't manage inventory, there is ultimately a cost to that, that at some point gets borne by the consumer. And so the idea is we got to be able to understand what people want to do a little bit earlier, a little bit closer in. We have \u2013 we can't have it be within 24 hours, just because we can't manage that last minute inventory. It's just not \u2013 it's very difficult to do. And so that's why we're doing it. We've had generally talked to a lot of our corporate customers and otherwise, and I think, people understand it. The reception has been perfectly fine. We are, to your comment, testing some other things. I'm not going to get into it in detail because we're deep in the middle of it. But hopefully sometime in the second half of the year we will layer some incremental opportunities on top of that, that would really start to bifurcate. Then really thinking about from the 48 hour, 72-hour mark out to seven days, creating fully flexible pricing structures and semi-flexible pricing structures that would require potentially even cancel seven days, within seven days. Again, with the effort being to be able to manage inventory more intelligently, what we find as we're testing it is the large majority of our customers actually do know within those time frames whether they need to cancel or not. It's just they haven't had to do anything about it. So they haven't. But if you can create the right incentive system where you give them an incentive to let you know earlier, it's good for them because they ultimately probably can get a little bit better deal. It's much better for us because we can manage that close-in inventory more intelligently to make sure that we both price it right, but more importantly, we fill as much as we can and don't leave rooms unoccupied.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Chris, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your RevPAR index increasing 60 basis points in the quarter, and increased every \u2013 in every brand in every region. I was just hoping if you could reconcile that with your U.S. RevPAR results. Your RevPAR growth in the quarter was in line with \u2013 was in line with upper upscale and upscale industry growth, and I know you're in other segments. But if you were just kind of looking at it kind of just not having the deep information that you would have, it might have been a little bit difficult to assume that you did grow RevPAR index in the quarter.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Right. I think, it gets down, Felicia, to the weighting. In the second quarter, if you look at where our brands are focused, it's not as much in leisure proportionately as some of the other brands that were driving the more significant increases in the star data. So, again, when you sort of weight it, it's comparable, but where we're getting more lift is in the brand. The brands that have more leisure orientation were driving more of the star result, and we're just not as present or present at all like in the economy segment as an example.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Helpful. And so \u2013 and you've been pretty clear about the success of Hampton, but can you just get maybe a little bit more granular where you might be seeing some pleasant surprises in your RevPAR index improvement?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Well, I think, the pleasant surprise I covered, and you did a nice job of covering it again, so thank you. Which is all of our segments went up, all of our geographies saw market share gains, which is important. Hampton, you know, I've said this many times before, I'm sure some would debate, I think, it is probably the most \u2013 objectively the most successful hotel brand in the world if you just look at market share, which it not just leads its category, it annihilates the competition at over 120% average market share. If you look at customer satisfaction scores, which we see. If you look at the demand from the development community here and around the world. You know, Hampton is one of the wonderful gifts that keeps giving.","But we have lots of those gifts, I mean, if you go across the portfolio of brands. One of the things that I've said many times, and certainly on a couple of prior calls which is as a consequence of a very much a focus on this approach is we want all of our brands to lead or be category killers in their segments. We do not want brands that are substandard because we don't want our customers playing a game of Russian roulette where, you know, some of the brands that they stay with are good and some of them aren't. So it's why we've chosen a path to be very focused on organic growth, both our existing brands, but also as we add new brands because we really feel like we can develop those brands in a way that really resonate from our product and service point of view with customers, better than taking on other problems.","So Hampton is one example, there are many of them. The good news story, as I say is, all of our brands are \u2013 have market share premiums, some more than others. On average 114%, which is the highest as far as I know in the industry, and I think there is more upside potential, but they're doing well, and we continue to focus on moving the needle, and have had good success doing that.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then just to switch gears for a second, there's been \u2013 obviously there's been a lot of focus on U.S. RevPAR. But just switching to international which did beat our expectations by a bit. I'm just wondering, and I don't even know if you can look at it this way, but how early are we in the cycle in Europe and Asia Pacific? And do you think we could see a few years of growth at these levels? And what customer segments are driving growth in those regions?","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hey, Felicia, it's Kevin. I'll take this one. I think, it's hard to say exactly where we are in the cycle. I think, Europe in terms of its economic cycle is behind where the U.S. has been and they're doing things like quantitative easing, and they have a lot of things to figure out whether it be around Brexit or otherwise that's driving a lot of business activity. Exactly where we are in the cycle, who knows?","I think, for a large \u2013 for the most part, our international markets are driven by transient. Growth has been very steady in all regions, and it's sort of coming from everywhere. And so there's no reason to think that we can't continue to grow RevPAR in those markets for a while, and how long, who knows?","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. You answered a lot of the questions. I guess, maybe just one to clarify the credit card branding fees. The guidance you gave about the basis point increase on the growth rate and all of that, can you just sort of help us ballpark? Is that like $60 million incremental to next year? And maybe it's just because part of it ended up falling in this year after all. So how much should we think about being the incremental from the credit card, the new agreement, on an annualized basis what that adds versus the old agreement?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good question, Robin. I think, that again there are limits on what we're \u2013 we've given you what we can give you. I think, if you're good with math, if you back into it, I think, you can get pretty close to the number. I mean, we're saying 200 basis points essentially on our overall fee base. I mean, that's a simple way to look at it. So take your model times 2%.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","But, I guess, I'm also trying to think about some of that falling in 2017, some of it doesn't start till January of 2018. So, the...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","We're giving you the incremental for 2018 in that number. Whatever is in 2017, we've baked into what we've \u2013 it's relatively modest, and we've baked that into the guidance we've given you.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Right.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","So, maybe it's $60 million...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","So the 200 basis points, it's baked into the 11%.","Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","The 11% factors for the catch-up.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","200 basis points. The 200 basis points is incremental.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","So the $60 million is incremental, but the total credit card range may be higher than that because that's maybe some of the 2017 increase that you bumped up today, right? So combining those to get to an annual? Is that the right way to think about it?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I'm not \u2013 maybe you take it offline with Chris and the team. I think, there's a modest amount of it in 2017. The bigger increment is going into 2018, and we've given you pretty much the number, 2%. So that's as far as we can go.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Just a first-off question, Chris. If I could follow up on Harry's question, it sounds like you feel, I guess, I'll say old fashioned, cyclical supply and demand is the main reason behind the stubborn re-acceleration in RevPAR. But could secular factors be the culprit here? Like maybe just continuing penetration of pricing transparency that fuels a new level of, I guess, I'll call it corporate frugality? Do you think there's some other factors that might be driving this?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I don't think so in a significant way. Again, I always want to be completely intellectually honest. You can't say when you sit where I sit that when the factors you just described, transparency \u2013 or heaven forbid I talk about the other things I know that are on your mind for fear of going into the black hole of Airbnb, but that some of those things don't have some impact.","But here's the thing, Jeff. Nothing that we're looking at suggests any of those things are having a material impact. It really is the economy. It really is that you've got growth, but it's fairly anemic broader growth. And you have an environment sadly where nobody can get along here in my hometown, and it creates caution.","I've said it a bunch of times. When I was at NYU, I think, I said it on stage or somewhere, but there's sort of caution flags out. If you're a business and thinking about hiring, spending, plant, equipment, it's not that they're not doing it. They are. It's just, I think, there's a little bit of caution in the air, and so they're holding back a bit.","Which is, again, why \u2013 we're seeing growth. It's positive. Business transient is positive. It can be more positive, I think, if people felt they had a little more certainty around what was going to happen with some of these big things that are swirling about legislatively.","And I think that's it more than anything. As I look at the data, as I talk to customers, I think the air of the \u2013 the balloon has just not got a lot of compression in it, or as much compression as we would like. And that's a little bit of a lack of confidence within that community.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just a question on maybe the outlook for distribution costs. And hopefully Kevin can maybe help you stay out of the black hole of Airbnb on this. Some of the OTAs have been emphasizing home rental business maybe as a way to thwart \u2013 like a flanking maneuver, if you will, by Airbnb that, out of fear they evolve into an OTA. Do you have a view on what can happen between the OTAs and home rental? And ultimately, do you think that's a battle? I guess, where I'm going is, do you think that's a battle that has a beneficial outcome for hotels? Maybe lower distribution costs?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yes. You know I'm usually very long-winded. I think, the answer is yes. Here is the thing. Competition is a good thing. And there being more competition in the home-sharing business and more \u2013 by the way, you know my fundamental belief, it's just a different travel occasion, trip occasion. We are not directly competitive with what they're doing. So more competition, I think is good there. More competition \u2013 them morphing in whatever ways to feeling more like an OTA is a good \u2013 whether they do that or not, I don't know, not for me to say. But the more competition there is in any space, the better off we are, I think, because more competition in theory would help have the impact of driving pricing down and distribution costs down. So I view that as a long game. Lots is going to go on over the next 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years. But as the competitive environment heats up, I think, the net result is good.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Can you give us a breakdown of monthly RevPAR in the U.S. in the quarter? And sorry for such a myopic question. But I think, the concern is June RevPAR slowed versus May, despite getting the July 4th benefit. And so \u2013 and that kind of coincided with some issues in and on the Hill or in D.C. So maybe there's just been a slowdown in demand.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hold on a second. You're getting very granular. So June was, in the U.S., up about a point. July in the U.S. up \u2013 would be adjusted up a bit. Thomas, why don't we get the data and we'll maybe get back with you.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I mean, I guess did anything stand out to you?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","What's the question you're trying to get at? I don't want to use the call to get into monthly data, all right?","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No. No. No. Exactly. So the question is, did it feel like, as we went through the quarter and into July, that because of kind of the headlines that were coming out of D.C. with the lack of healthcare reform playing out, and maybe some other \u2013 with the issues in Russia or with Russia...","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, that...","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Did it feel like those impacted the math?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","That's a better question. Not to pick on you. That's a better question. So the answer is, yeah. I mean, July is an odd month both because there's all the swirl in the air, which is clearly not helping. But it also started out with a bang with 4th of July week basically being a non \u2013 the whole week was off travel, particularly business travel, which is the largest part of our system. So, again, I think when you holiday adjust it, it's a different story. Or day of the week adjust the holiday, it's a different story. But July, July is going to be weak.","Now, August, as we look at the data going into August, it reverses that trend. August is back, our expectation is and with the business we have on the books, is both August and then September when you cleanse it for the Jewish holidays, back on track. So a large part of what's going on in July, the best data we have was kicking off with a really bad week that people didn't travel. And then going into the next week they were in summer mode. And that made it a painful start to July. So I don't see between May, June, July, August, if I put it all together, I don't think there's any real trend in July. When we get through August \u2013 obviously we haven't gotten through August. But with what's on the books, I think we'll find that August was back on track.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. And then I saw a press release out, I think it was this week, that you're going to do a Hilton Garden Inn refresh. Can you just talk about the thought process behind that?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we're constantly looking at every one of these brands, as I've talked a little bit about it before, both our new brands, but our existing brands to make sure that both from a product service point of view, profitability point of view, they resonate with customers, and with owners. And so this is the next turn of the wheel for Garden Inn and just coming up with the next iteration of design that makes sure that it appeals to customers. A bunch of changes, you know, modest changes in the rooms. Bunch of changes in approach to the public spaces and food and beverage, that gets rolled out over a pretty extended period of time, that ultimately we think is going to be better for customers, and will drive greater profitability. More efficient to build, more efficient to operate, more revenue generating opportunities in the public spaces.","So I think, this is sort of business as usual for us. I mean, we do, you know, sometimes they get headlines, it's funny when they do. Sometimes they don't. But we're \u2013 all of our existing brands are in a constant state of motion in terms of trying to figure out how to make sure that they remain relevant.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","So sorry to beat a dead horse here on demand trends, but earlier in the year you had suggested that if some of the early trends continue, you could be at the high end of the RevPAR range. I know now you're saying the forecast would suggest the midpoint of the range. Am I reading too much into that comment? Or has demand softened because of some of these D.C. issues that you talked about? And is that entirely attributed to business transient, or have you seen changes in the leisure and group side as well?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","No. I think in the main what I'd say is \u2013 what I tried to say, hopefully, I did say it this way on earlier calls, that if we had a 1% to 3% range, you should always assume when we give a range that our forecast is somewhere around the middle of it. We try and be very disciplined about that. I think what I was trying to indicate is if we do get \u2013 I had some optimism, as did many, that if we do get some of this legislative stuff going, that it would unlock a little bit more optimism in the business community, which would drive hiring, spending, investment, et cetera, that I thought could translate on a lag into the business, and could propel us above the midpoint or somewhere between the midpoint to high point.","As I sit here today and I sort of covered in my prepared comments, it's not that I don't think that that can happen. I'm still sort of hopeful that eventually we are going to get to tax reform and we're going to get past healthcare and some of the noise that's out there. The difference between now and then is we're more than halfway through the year. We all know that if these things happen, the trickle through to benefit us is on a lag, and given we're halfway through the year and they haven't done it, and they're getting ready to go on summer recess, it just stands to reason that by the time, if they get it done, they do get it done, we're not going to have enough time for it to trickle through and really benefit this year.","So that puts us in the midpoint of our guidance and plus or minus that's where we've been. I would say, over the last couple quarters our forecasting has been within 20 bps of the midpoint one way or another. So, I would say our forecasting hasn't changed materially. My view of it of getting any of that incremental benefit this year has just because the year is running out on us.","Now, hopefully things happen towards the end of the year, tax reform and otherwise, and that will give us some opportunities next year. But it just seems, I would say, just realism setting in where we are in the year suggests it's a little bit harder to make that assumption right now.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Bill.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Chris, I wanted to limit my focus on Chinese investors and they've been in the news quite a bit. I'm not sure how much you can tell me about what you're hearing from HNA and their future plans, and their stake in your company. But also Anbang and the Waldorf in New York, if you can give us an update there. You said you're going to open a new luxury hotel. I didn't know if that might be the new flagship Waldorf. And kind of what's happening to your fee income from the Waldorf that I think at one point was thought to be as much as $10 million a year. What's happening while the hotel is closed?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. And I thought that it was odd that I might make it to this call and not talk about our Chinese partners. So, Bill, thank you for making sure we got to that.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","You're welcome.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I am three minutes out, and I almost got through, no.","Hey. So here's the thing. Obviously both Anbang and HNA have been in the press along with some other major Chinese conglomerates lately, and we've obviously had discussions with both groups.","I think as it relates to HNA, I don't have a lot to add to what you're reading about in the sense that we continue to have a dialogue with them. We continue to work on the things that I have described in the past to you, and we continue to work on the process of onboarding a couple of board members, all as planned. And what happens with them? Ultimately, obviously, I don't know, but it appears to us sort of business as usual. And so I don't think that there's anything much more to say about that. I'm happy to answer any other sort of questions on that.","On Anbang, we've had lots of discussion with those guys. As far as we know, their intentions are to continue at a rapid pace to enter into the major redevelopment of the Waldorf later this year. We continue to work on all the design and planning, and the intention is later this fall we'll get into the heavy demolition. And it will probably be, honestly, three years of work when that starts to get it up and operating. So as far as we know, they are moving forward. In every conversation that we've had with them, they have suggested that to be the case. So time will tell.","As it relates to our fees, I think I can tell you. I mean we disclosed it. It's a little over $7 million in fees that we earned on it last year. I think $7.3 million is what I remember, but call it $7 million, that went away this year that when it reopens we'll come back, and we think when it reopens it will be higher than what it was when it left the system, that's built into our numbers. That's already out of the numbers that we're giving you because obviously we knew the Waldorf was going to be closing. So it's been out of the numbers.","In terms of the new hotel that's opening in midtown, that is not the Waldorf. It would be a miracle for them to be able to get it open by the end of the year since it's going to take about three years to renovate it. It's another deal that I had hoped that we'd be able to talk about specifically. We can't.","We're very close to signing another deal that will be with \u2013 hopefully, if all gets done, it would be done with the Conrad brand, not the Waldorf brand given what we're doing with the Waldorf Astoria. And hopefully by next quarter, we'll have it at a place where we can disclose the specific assets.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Chris, two very quick follow-ups on that. Can you remind us the lockup period for the HNA investment? And then number two, to the best of your knowledge, has Anbang gotten \u2013 have they secured the financing for the redevelopment?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","On the second one, I do not know. They certainly represented to us that they have the financial capacity to do the renovation. Exactly where they're getting that money, I do not know and probably will never know, I mean, in the sense that they have a lot of resources given the size of their business.","On the HNA lockup, what was the question? It's a 24-month lockup. They closed in March. So they've got, whatever, 20 months left on that lockup.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","The next question will be from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Morning.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","A big picture, cyclical type of question here. Given the trajectory of your signings and what you know about that, this cycle \u2013 where would you think the peak growth rate in openings for you will occur? And is it 2018? 2019? 2020? Where might you peg that at?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Gosh. I hope it is way out in the future. I don't know. I mean, if you look at it now in terms of openings, obviously we're picking up this year over last year. We will have a record year in construction starts this year. Over 80,000 rooms we'll start construction. So that would suggest that the peak is somewhere two or three years out, but that makes the assumption that somehow everything tails off which I think it's hard to assume at this point.","If we do our job, we're going to find ways in this big world we live in to keep deploying resources and brands and following demand patterns that are different in different places of the world. It's not this year. It's not next year, just given what's going on in construction, it's probably a few years out.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask, you mentioned that with HNA it's really just business as usual at this point. But given the financial concerns that have been described in the press, I guess, at what point would you become more concerned about your relationship with them. And I think the shares are on margin right now, and is there some point where that could start to impact the relationship with you?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","Well, I am always concerned. I mean, if investors are concerned, then it makes me concerned. But I'm probably less concerned not to diminish the issue, but I'm probably less concerned than investors are simply because as it relates to the strategic opportunities, we were very clear in saying that we thought that was good strategic potential. But then it wasn't like something we were building into numbers. It was just long term we thought there were a bunch of things we could do together that would be beneficial and I still think that. And it wasn't like we were counting on in our numbers this year or next year, the following year that something was going to happen.","So there's no downside to that. As it relates to their share ownership, of course, I would worry about that if I thought there was something to worry about. At the moment, I don't think there's something to worry about in the sense that they bought the position. I'm going to use round numbers for $6.5 billion. The current position in three companies is worth $7.5 billion. They've margined $3 billion. So there's $4.5 billion of equity. Call me old fashioned, but that's a lot of equity and a lot of margin for error. So I guess if you said to me it was much more highly leveraged or margined then, I guess, it would stand to reason I should worry more. But given that under their loan agreements, as I understand it, and then they're publicly filed, they're capped at $3 billion. They have pledged the stock against $3 billion from four big global money center banks. I think, again, it doesn't keep me up at night. I think everything \u2013 that's why I say business as usual. They own it. They've got a lot of margin, low leverage, lot of margin. And I think strategically the things that we'll do are super long-term anyway, and we'll keep chugging along.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And can I just ask you one other quick one? You had mentioned earlier about maybe some of the supply in the U.S. potentially weighing on mid-scale and upper mid-scale. I'm just curious. Do you think this current kind of supply growth in the U.S. might peak in 2018 or do you see that continuing to build a little bit into 2019 and the out years as well?","Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.","I think it likely peaks next year, maybe a little bit into the first half of 2019. Just if you look at the stats on what's going on and what's getting under construction in the U.S. I think you are past the peak in deal signings. And you are sort of approaching the peak, given that the financing environment has become more difficult for things getting under construction. And so, I'd say you're sort of subject to things sort of staying as is. You're sort of into the gestation period than of delivering what's there. Once that's done, the pipe isn't getting as full.","Now the good news for us is our brands do disproportionately well because they're more financeable. We've added new brands and I think intelligently at the right time and for where we are in the cycle with Tru and Tapestry and Curio. And so, we've been able to bend the arc of the curve a bit relative to what's going on in the industry. So our growth has continued to chug along. But I think it's 2018, early 2019, all things being equal.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our first quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Nassetta","Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As we celebrate our 100th anniversary just this month, we're proud of all of the accomplishments over this last century, a century where we hosted over 3 billion guests, employed over 10 million team members and contributed over $1 trillion of economic impact. But as we look to the next 100 years, we're even more excited and confident in our ability to drive continued success. We believe that success will ultimately be driven by the strength of our model, which should continue to drive outperformance. ","That outperformance will be driven by industry-leading market share premiums that drive premium hotel performance and attract more capital from owners, which, in turn, drives higher net unit growth. This, combined with the resiliency and capital-light nature of our fee-based business, allows us to grow free cash flow and return greater and greater amounts of capital over time and through all parts of the business cycle.","Turning to the quarter. We're pleased to report a good start to the year with adjusted EBITDA and EPS ahead of our expectations and RevPAR growth near the midpoint of our guidance range. Both system-wide and U.S. RevPAR grew 1.8%, outperforming the changed scale-weighted industry data due to strong market share gains across all brands and major regions. Overall, system-wide RevPAR index premiums increased more than 230 basis points. System-wide group business remained strong as we've seen for several quarters with RevPAR up 3.7%.","Transient RevPAR grew approximately 1% driven by steady U.S. leisure demand tempered somewhat by softer U.S. corporate demand in March and somewhat weaker international performance. For the full year, our outlook remains largely in line with our prior expectations as macro indicators suggest continued growth across global economies. The outlook for the U.S. for GDP growth should continue to support steady demand and solid pricing gains. Additionally, our corporate negotiated business and forward group bookings for 2019 both remained solid.","On the development front, we had a strong start to the year. In the quarter, we opened more than 12,000 growth rooms, achieved 7% net unit growth and exceeded our expectation for construction starts and approvals. We increased our pipeline to 371,000 rooms boosted by growth across U.S. and international markets. ","We also continue to see positive trends across existing projects as rooms under construction increased to represent more than 52% of our pipeline. For the full year, we expect this momentum to continue. We remain on track to deliver approximately 6.5% net unit growth. Additionally, we expect another year of record signings with steady trends in the U.S. and double-digit increases across both the APAC and EMEA regions. This continued pipeline growth should lead to solid unit growth for the next several years.","We remain disciplined and deliberate in our approach to expansion, following demand trends around the world. We evaluate each market opportunity to the right products in the right locations to best serve guests and to maximize on our returns. Our attractive owner value proposition allows us to grow with minimal use of our own capital. ","Over 90% of our pipeline does not have any capital contribution for us, a trend that has remained consistent over recent years. This supports higher net fees per room once those projects are complete. For that reason, the vast majority of new units enter our system at virtually 100% margin and with an infinite yield.","Our organic growth strategy has yielded fantastic results, spanning multiple brands and countries. Just last month, we celebrated the grand opening of the Conrad Washington, D.C. This hotel marks our first luxury property in the nation's capital. The 360-room hotel features 30,000 square feet of luxury retail space, 32,000 square feet of meeting space and the Sakura Club, which provides exclusive access to an elevated and personalized hospitality experience. ","We also opened the Conrad Hangzhou, a 50-story luxury hotel in China's growing technology and innovation hub. The property reflects the brand's modern stylists and dynamic spirit while demonstrating our commitment to expanding our presence across China with a well-rounded portfolio.","In the quarter, we also signed several agreements that we expect to contribute to growth over the longer term, including 4 new hotels totaling 1,400 rooms that will be part of a spectacular mixed-use project in Riyadh. The hotel will carry flags ranging from Hilton Garden Inn to Waldorf Astoria. Additionally, we signed an agreement to add 5 new hotels in France within the next 5 years.","To drive further growth, we recently launched our newest brand, Signia Hilton, an innovative product that will set a new standard for the meetings and events industry. Each property will feature a minimum of 500 guest rooms, at least 75 square feet of event space per room and state-of-the-art technology. The brand will debut with openings of properties in Orlando, Atlanta and Indianapolis.","On the loyalty front, we ended the quarter with nearly 90 million Honors members, was up 20% year-over-year. On average, we are enrolling approximately 1.5 million Honors members per month, and they're more engaged than ever before with over half of our total membership active. In the quarter, Honors percentage occupancy reached over 60% and was up 170 basis points year-over-year, demonstrating that members are also staying with us more often.","We're always striving to better meet guests' evolving needs and think great products and innovation are only a part of that story. Guest satisfaction relies heavily on the talent and passion of our team to deliver incredible experiences, and creating an exceptional workplace culture is extremely important to that effort. For that reason, we're thrilled to be ranked #1 on Fortune's best companies to work for list in the U.S., becoming the first hospitality company in history and the first non-tech company since 2004 to achieve this number 1 rating.","Overall, we're very pleased with the first quarter results and feel good about our momentum for the balance of the year. Our story is simple. Our resilient business model, growing market share, capital-light development strategy should lead to significant free cash flow generation and strong shareholder returns. As we celebrate our 100th anniversary, we are confident this truly will be our most dynamic year yet.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results for the quarter and outlook for the rest of the year.","Kevin Jacobs","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.8% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis. Results benefited from strong group business, particularly given holiday shifts, and increased market share partially offset by softer-than-anticipated international growth. Adjusted EBITDA of $499 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range, increasing 12% year-over-year as our fee segment outperformed expectations. In the quarter, management franchise fees increased 12% to $517 million, ahead of our 7% to 9% guidance range due to better-than-expected license fees and roughly $10 million of timing items. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items grew 16% to $0.80, also exceeding expectations.","Turning to our regional performance and outlook. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 1.8% with outperformance primarily driven by increasing market share and strong group business. Our U.S. portfolio also benefited from recently completed renovations across our Embassy Suites and Hampton portfolios. For full year 2019, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in line with our system-wide guidance range based on steady fundamentals. In the Americas outside of the U.S., first quarter RevPAR grew 4.4% versus the prior year given the strength in the Caribbean and Latin America. Puerto Rico saw particularly strong results with double-digit rate gains led by solid transient trends. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be at the higher end of our system-wide guidance.","RevPAR in Europe grew 3.2% in the quarter as London benefited from strong international inbound travel, and good group business boosted our results in Barcelona. However, softening transient demand in the broader UK tempered growth. We expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth in Europe to be at the higher end of our system-wide range given strong trends in Turkey and continued growth in Continental Europe, modestly offset by uncertainty in the UK. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR fell 5.7% in the quarter. Similar to the trends we've been seeing in prior quarters, significant levels of new supply in the United Arab Emirates continued to pressure ADR. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be down in the low single digits given continued leisure softness across the UAE and Saudi Arabia.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 1% in the quarter largely due to slowdowns in intra-China leisure travel, especially over the Chinese New Year period as well as some of the international outbound travel to China. ","For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth for the Asia Pacific region in the 3% to 5% range accounting for softer performance in the quarter and an expected reacceleration throughout the year driven by good group and event-driven business in Japan and an overall pickup in China.","Moving to the, moving to guidance. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth consistent with prior guidance of 1% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA of $2.265 billion to $2.305 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 9% at the midpoint. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $3.74 to $3.84.","For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 2%, including a modest headwind from calendar shifts. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $610 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.98 to $1.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases.","Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the first quarter for a total of $44 million in dividends. Our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. For 2019, we continue to expect to return between $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.","Before we open the call for questions, we want to answer a question we've been getting recently about the resiliency of our business model in certain downsized scenarios. Our sensitivity to changes in the macro environment is materially lower than it has been historically given the spins of our real estate and timeshare businesses and the nature of our remaining fee business. Fees generate more than 90% of our earnings with top line-driven fees accounting for more than 90% of those fees. ","Additionally, our incentive management fees, which account for just 10% of total fees, are less volatile and roughly 85% of them do not stand behind any owner's priority return. Resiliency is further supported by our strong net unit growth and continued disciplined approach to corporate expenses.","As you can see from our guidance, we feel good about our outlook for the year and are not forecasting RevPAR declines. However, to be responsive to these questions and illustrate the resiliency of our model, we would expect flat to slightly positive growth in adjusted EBITDA and positive growth in free cash flow in an environment where RevPAR were to decline 5% to 6%. As a result, we think we are well positioned to continue driving shareholder returns through all parts of the cycle.","Further details on our first quarter results and our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.","This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Denise, can we have our first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli","Chris, Kevin, it's been more or less 2.5 months since the last call. And I'm just wondering kind of obviously, the March data that was out there wasn't great from, I think, most people's point of view. What have you guys seen since we last spoke with respect to the demand environment domestically that makes you more or, and\/or less confident with your outlook?","Chris Nassetta","Great question. I suspect, Carlo, on everybody's mind, so thanks for asking it. Maybe I'll tell you about the quarter a little bit more, although we gave some comments in the prepared remarks, and then talk about expectations for the full year. I think, thinking about the quarter maybe and the full year breaking it down between the U.S. and international and then breaking it down separately by segments and comparing it sort of how we felt when we sat at this table doing this last quarter. I would say in an overarching way, it's not a lot different, okay? But I'll give you a little bit more than that. ","I think if you look at the quarter and we look at what we had forecasted for the quarter, the U.S. was pretty much in line in the first quarter with what we thought. I'll talk about segments in a minute. International was a little bit lower, not surprisingly. So that drove a little bit lower result overall in the first quarter than we thought but not material. If you look at the segments sort of embedded in your question, group was a little bit better than we thought, and transient was a little bit worse than we thought. The net result wasn't a whole lot, as I say, it didn't drag the overall answer down a lot. But leisure hung in there if you break transient apart and was pretty stable. It was a little bit lower than we had seen on average for certainly the first half of last year, but that's exactly what we expected and exactly what we talked about in the last call. ","Business transient, though, was a little bit weaker than we thought, really driven by March. Our view on that, although it's really hard to be honestly perfectly scientific about it, our view on that when we've studied all of the data and talked internally about it is as much as spring break, as much as Easter moved out of the month and you would think you'll get a real benefit from that, what happened as a result of Easter being so late was that spring break got spread out throughout the whole month. And so when we look at the travel patterns as it related and sort of overlaid the spring break season with it, we think it had a material impact on business travel during that period. And that was what was driving the bulk of the business transient weakness in March.","On that, let me tell you about the full year. So as we think about the full year, again, breaking it down, U.S. and international versus what we were thinking when we gave you guidance, it's about the same. U.S. is pretty much our view today reasonably consistent with where it was. International, the answer is reasonably consistent with where we were. How you get there is a little bit different. We, obviously, with the print in Asia Pacific notwithstanding in Kevin's remarks, he said we think we're going to be a 3% to 5%, and it's going to get better. And we feel reasonably confident it will because of event-driven issues in Japan and are already seeing some reacceleration in China. ","Given the print of 1% in the first quarter, we think Asia Pacific will be lower than we thought. But at the same time, Europe, core Europe is going to be a little bit better than we thought. And Americas, non-U. S. is going to be a bit better than we thought. So the net result of all of that is, honestly, when we lay all this out, that U.S. and international are pretty much going to play out in a very consistent way, at least in our forecasting, to what we thought a quarter ago. If you look at the segments, I would say similar answer. The group is going to lead the charge again this year and have the highest level of growth. I think it will sort of end up at the midpoint to the high end of our guidance. I think that is, at this point, fully supported by group position on the book, so we feel pretty good about that. On the transient side, I would say expectations, the demand is going to be healthy and continuing to grow in a way that will deliver sort of towards the midpoint of our guidance on transient. ","We think both leisure and business will be in that zone. Obviously, leisure had sort of been in that zone. Business transient, at least in March, was not. So we're obviously watching it very carefully. But as we look at the trends getting past the Easter effect of April into May and June, while it's still early, it does look like business transient sort of goes back to a more normal pattern.","And so that's sort of the underpinnings for how we maintained, if you will, our guidance of 1% to 3%., not surprisingly as I've said many, many times on these calls. I mean, what you should generally do is look at the midpoint of our guidance as a strong indicator for the, if we had to pick a point, the point that we feel most comfortable with. ","And given we're still early in the year, we're trying to create a range of outcomes around it. But 2% is the midpoint of our guidance, and that's, frankly, that's sort of where we're most comfortable. And when I sat here a quarter ago, when Kevin and I sat here, that's what we were thinking pretty much within 0.10 point at that time.","Operator","The next question will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joe Greff","Obviously, the stock is reacting very strongly to today's reports in your comments, Chris and Kevin. So my question related to the stock price is how sensitive are you to capital returns specifically to buybacks with a higher stock price?","Chris Nassetta","Joe, the reality is we gave you a range of 1.3% to 1.8%, and we intend for that to be the range. I think if you look at the midpoint of our leverage, which should be 3.25, that really gets you more to the mid- to the high end of that range, which I'd say, it would probably be the sort of the higher probability of where we end up. And we're obviously, if you've seen in the first quarter, we bought, I think, on average in the low $70. So we get, we're trying to spend a little as we can buy, and at the same time, the stock is performing well isn't going to stop us from achieving our guidance.","In the sense that in every scenario that we look at, given the resiliency and strength of the model, buying our stock is still a significant premium to our weighted average cost of capital. And in terms of the grid that we're looking at, there is no price that's in that grid that I think would take us out of the market. We like the stock. We like it at $70, we like it $80, we like it at $90. We'll like it at $100 and beyond because we think the future is obviously quite strong.","Joe Greff","Great. And then, Chris, you mentioned before about all the levers that you're doing to grow membership within Hilton Honors. Can you talk about where you think you can go in terms of occupancy, system-wide occupancy related to your loyalty program? And maybe outside of the lodging, what other businesses do you look to benchmark where that dependency should be? And that's all for me.","Chris Nassetta","Yes. I mean, maybe give you a little bit more on Honors because I know we get a lot of questions on it, so I'll sort of give a broader response. Obviously, we gave you the numbers. The Honors membership was up 20% to 90 million. Some of them as, and we gave you, it's over 60%, up 170 bps. What we didn't say is that over the last 2 years, on Honors occupancy was up 400 basis points. We did, I did talk about how we've gone to having over 50% of our members engaged. By the way, if you go back, I don't know, 5 years ago, that number was probably 25%. We have a much smaller number. ","So I think if you do the math, we have probably 6 to 8x the number of engaged members in Honors as compared to 5 years ago. And I think the basic underpinnings of our strategy are, one, to make sure that we create the best value proposition, so that essentially, you have to be a member of Honors. You're crazy not to be. That means pricing. If you're an Honors member, you get the best price guarantee. Period. End of story. There is nowhere else to get a better price. That, the work that we're doing with our app, with our online, web direct and online presence that we're taking friction out of it, that we're making it a much better experience to dream, to book, the shop and ultimately, book. That, the digital tools in our app, particularly our Digital Key, straight-to-room, Connected Room, all of those things are only available to Honors members. And that those are powerful enough, in addition to these other things like pricing and other things to really be a draw for Honors.","The other thing we've been in the last 2 or 3 years spending a lot of time on is both our highest-level members and our lowest-level members because we love all our members, and we want everyone engaged. And the reason we've been able to double our percentage of engaged members and get 6 to 8x the numbers is because we've been focusing on both. At the highest level, we're doing a, we've been doing a bunch of things. But some of the bigger things are more generous, elite earnings bonuses that our highest-level members love, unlimited milestone bonuses, elite rollover nights, the ability to gift elite status to a travel partner. There are about 20 other things, but those are some of the ones that come to mind, the things that just make it that much more compelling for those that already give us the largest share of their wallet to continue to stay with us.","At the lowest level where people don't travel that much, our blue members are, and the first few levels, it's about creating value for them. And beyond just you get the best price, they get the best price, of course. But what are, if they're going to collect points they don't stay enough to trade them into nights, what do they do with them? How do you create value? So our points and money slider, which I believe we're the only one that really do in the industry, so you can use any number of points with a matching dollar amount and redeem for nights. Or shop with points or deal with Amazon where you can buy anything you want. Amazon Prime, you can use certain Honors points. Or points pooling where you can, without any additional charge, pool your points between members and use those points. Those are a few. ","Again, there are many more examples of things that we're doing to get our lowest-level members that maybe they're only low-level members potentially because they don't travel that much generally. But we love them, too, and we want them to be engaged with us. The other thing is the co-brand card. We've spent a lot of time and effort in figuring out how to source that a couple of years ago with AMEX, and we can get more into it. But it's been, the cards, the array of cards have been incredibly well received and driving real strong value proposition. If you look at our base cardholders, they have 2 times the stay activity that you would find in an average active member. ","And as you go up into the higher-level cards, it's 4 time the stay activity. And so those cards are helping drive loyalty and drive share. And then a whole bunch of things in Honors on the experiential side whether that's Live Nation, Formula 1 and a whole bunch of other things that we're looking at that will make, that are really cool ideas and things that more to come on where you give your Honors members a value proposition and ways to redeem those points that are for things that they can't otherwise get on their own.","So in terms of your, you asked a question, and I didn't forget it, which is what level of occupancy. I'm looking at my team, of course, I tell them why. If it's the best deal and all these things, why it isn't 100% of our occupancy Honors? Because it's crazy that people don't join, but obviously, that's a bit of a pipe dream. But I think it can be well over 60%. ","I think, ultimately, over the next 5 years, my goal would be that we're in the 70% to 80% range because we create a story that is compelling enough, and we make sure that our, that broadly, our customers and others that might consider us understand that being a member of Honors is being, is joining an elite club that gives you a whole bunch of experiences and things and value that you can't get otherwise.","Operator","The next question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet.","Harry Curtis","Chris, last quarter, you commented that you're finding some success increasing your occupancy during the shoulder periods. And what's interesting is that your U.S. RevPAR performance was about 100 basis points stronger than the Smith Travel data. Can you talk about to what degree that strategy is driving that versus the success that you've seen in your brands and the premiums that they're generating?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. It's a really good question and deserves to get answered. Unfortunately, maybe you won't be satisfied with it because it's classically not any one thing. I mean, we, in the U.S., our market share numbers, as I stated in my prepared comments, we're really strong in the quarter, up 260 basis points. And certainly, some of it is on the commercial side being smarter about our pricing, our customer-centric pricing model where we got off the bar and we do semi flex and fully flex with a premium for fully flexed and a slight discount for semi flex. ","That clearly is driving the right behavior in terms of lowering cancellations. Cancellations are down over the last couple of years by 10%. And I think we're at a better reasonable level. And it's driving a bit of a premium where more people are buying and consuming the fully flexed product and that are taking the discount, which is where all of our testing set, and so it's giving us a little boost. So that, there's a little bit of that.","We've obviously been pushing new marketing campaigns with Anna Kendrick otherwise that are very focused on direct book and the value proposition and a value guarantee where we guarantee 25% off if you find a better price, which is trying to point out the customers that might otherwise think because they're bombarded with all the digital and other forms of media that say they can get a better deal somewhere else that we're going to guarantee it. And that's been working.","But the part that will be less satisfying for you, it's a whole bunch of other things. I think what we're doing with our product strategy, what we're doing with service strategy, being number 1 Great Place to Work, I wanted to talk about and congratulate our team because we're in a service business. And having our team inspired and motivated to do great things means, and feeling good about what they're doing with us means they're going to do better job with our customers. ","So it's a lot about service. It's a lot about loyalty, which I won't go back into because in Joe's question, I answered it at great length. But it's a bunch of other things. It's a bunch of the things that we're doing in technology with our web presence and increasing conversion. So long-winded way of saying it's coming from a lot of different places, which is what I love about it, which is it's not 1 trick, and it's not sort of 1 thing that's flash in the pan. It's a whole bunch of different strategies that are converging that are working. And of course, our job is to keep them working, which we intend to do.","Harry Curtis","Very good. And just a quick follow-up going back to Asia. Did I hear you correctly that you are seeing some reacceleration in Asia, specifically China?","Chris Nassetta","Yes, we are. Post Chinese New Year, we are starting to see some pickup all stop. We expect to see more, to be honest, and then the comps also gets a bit easier. And then in Japan, which, remember, Japan is still, from a bottom line point of view, the biggest market for us in Asia. There are a bunch of big event-driven things happening in the back half of the year that are sort of money in the bag, meaning they are happening, and they would definitely help boost the business in Japan, which is going to help the second half of the year in APAC.","Operator","The next question will be from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Chris, your opening remarks emphasized the bull case from the network effects of the business model. As we look out over the next few years and think through the expansion of international markets in China in particular, I guess, what are some of the added benefits that investors should be thinking about from the increased scale if we look at other developing markets as a road map?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. Well, I mean, I talked about it, I think, in our last call, Stephen. Thank you for the question. I mean, what, it all starts for us to make the model work and if we're to continue to be organic growth and capital-light and infinite yields and 100% margin, all those fun things that we like, it all starts with doing a great job for customers but also doing a great job for owners and driving returns for owners. What owners are looking at is share. And so I think what's been happening over the last, honestly, over the last 12 years but increasingly over the last 2 or 3, and I talked about it on the last couple of calls, is we have been building the network effect that we've had for quite some time in the United States and the other mega regions around the world. And even as we are not nearly as distributed there, we've been investing in our commercial infrastructure and our loyalty and other things sort out ahead of the curve, and it's really starting to hit pay dirt.","So last year was the first time in history we grew market share everywhere in the world, including the U.S. But for the first time, the other regions actually were eager to frankly eclipse our market share, which is hard to do. But it is, I think, testimonial to the fact that the network effect is starting to work there. And so I think that is in the first quarter was a carry on to that. And I suspect if we do our job, you'll see the same thing this year, which is all of the regions will be, so the international regions will be equal to or greater in market share, and all of them will show growth. That's a fabulous leading indicator to what should happen with the network effect because that attracts more capital. Owners know that. It's a small network of folks. ","And in the end, when they're signing up in 2030, in many cases, longer deals, it's really about having the confidence that you're going to be around. We've been around 100 years. We'll be around another 100 years. So you're not going to disappear, and that you're going to be able to drive premium performance because they're investing billions of dollars in the bricks and mortar.","And so I think as we think about our obsession with market share, which we have for good reason and the trajectory on that, I think it makes us feel really good. I think it's why you see the pipeline growing, rooms under construction going in NUG. I feel, as I said in my prepared comments, quite good about the next several years just given what's in production, what's under construction around the world and our ability to continue to do a component of our NUG through conversions.","Stephen Grambling","More direct follow-up, perhaps quickly. How should we think about royalty rates and partnership opportunities in those markets as you gain scale?","Chris Nassetta","I think that as we gain scale and as we drive market share, I think there are opportunities to increase royalty rates. I wouldn't say that you're going to see a seismic shift anytime soon because we would rather perform ahead of doing that, but I think there are opportunities. ","And certainly, as we build our loyalty platforms to get to a much greater scale not unlike the U.S. and our deal with Amex, there are opportunities in the co-brand space that we're already pursuing and other partnership opportunities as we continue to build that network. So this is, I would say, and we said it at the IPO, we said it at the spin, it's a really powerful platform that we've built. ","And the nice thing as an investor is we kind of have all the pieces of it to make it work. We have to make it work, okay? It's a lot of hard work. But we've got the scale. We've got the broad geographic diversity. We have the chain scale diversity. We're obviously adding some brands to fill in spaces. But we've got the, we've got what we need to make the magic. ","And now it really is about grinding and making it work and continuing to grow market share, deliver better returns for owners by doing better things for customers, and the virtuous cycle will not only continue but hopefully pick up.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shaun Kelley","Chris, maybe just sort of to sum up on, yes, I think, a lot of discussion has happened here on the market share gains and some of the systems and in Honors and investments that you're making. So could you maybe just sort of give us a little bit of a view to the future on where are you making the largest investments from here, both maybe in terms of dollars and management time as you start to refine some of these programs? It seems like they're all working extraordinarily well at the moment. So where are you kind of, where do you see some of the biggest opportunities? And where are you kind of putting your money to drive some of these network effects going forward?","Chris Nassetta","I would say probably in 3 primary areas, and I won't repeat myself: Honors always is the most important engine that we have, obviously, for loyalty but broadly for market share. So I gave you a list of some of the things we have done. There's a whole list of other things that we will be doing. I'd rather not get into it. The limits of time, it's probably not a great place to do it. But lots of additional things going on in Honors with the objective being what I said, ultimately, we want Honors occupancy to be the vast majority of our occupancy because you're crazy not to be a member just because the value proposition in the experiential side of Honors is so good that you're crazy not to be a member. And we're, I think we're amongst, if not, the highest in the industry in percentage of occupancy at the moment. But I think we could do a lot better. And my gauge is not what others are doing. It's what I think we can do. The other area which is related to Honors is technology where we obviously brought in over the last couple of years a whole bunch of incremental talent in this area to figure out how to do add more delight to the customer experience and take more friction out of the experience, whether that is with the app and Connected Room, Digital Key, room selection. ","You're going to see a whole bunch of really neat things coming out of those efforts, payments area, and the list goes on, but a huge amount of investment, system investment. Let me be careful on that because of the way this works, not for the record for those that don't know our model as well, not investment that comes off, comes out of our income statement or our balance sheet because of the way the system works. We have lots of opportunities to invest in these things but, with system funds but significant investment there. And then marketing, investing, not just in spending more in marketing, which we have been doing to a degree and taking away money, but how we spend it. And the world is a very different place than it was even a few years ago. ","And we're obviously trying to continue not only to get drive more market share premiums, but we're trying to do it in a way that is most profitable, which means driving more direct business. And so how we go to market, what our message is, how frequently sort of to be able to, have our voice rise above, I think, is really important. So there's clearly, again, those are system when you think about all of these, just to be clear, these are system investments, not Hilton off our P&L investment. But that's where the bulk of the investing dollars come from. Those are probably the 3. There are a whole bunch of others. Those are probably the 3 areas I'd say that are the tip of the spear for us in continuing to ultimately drive share.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly","Just first, I want to follow up, I guess, on Harry's question. How much of the market share gains that you saw in the first quarter were attributable to the Embassy Suites and Hampton renovations? And do you think that's going to be sustained through 2019? And maybe how much was measurably, or can you measurably, I guess, account for that came from the Marriott-Starwood integration, maybe challenges they might have faced in Q1?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. The answer will be the same. We have no idea on that. The nice thing about Smith Travel is it's wonderful data that we get. It's really good and accurate data as it relates to us. We have no clue because we get no data as it relates to anybody else. So we don't know where it comes from. Arguably, it's coming from a lot of places. And with the gains we had in the first quarter, it's hard to believe it didn't come from some big competitors. But we don't know. In terms of what we think of Embassy in Hampton, I would say scientific, a small amount of it ultimately in the first quarter came from that. We were, we've been working very hard on share.","I'm not going to say that when we started the quarter, we thought we'd get 230 basis points of share. We didn't. We were planning on share gains. They were a little heavier than that, than we thought. I wouldn't expect that we would maintain that level of share gains for the whole year. We certainly have an objective, as we always do, to gain share. As I said, we gained 1 point globally last year. I think we've gained share, everyone in the last 12 years. When you're at 114 plus and already have industry-leading market share, moving share is hard. 230 points is really, really hard. So I would not expect that for the full year, but I would certainly expect that we will have share gains.","Kevin Jacobs","And Jeff, I'd just add that in terms of, yes, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, Embassy in Hampton are benefiting from coming out of renovations. Not in all cases, but in a lot of cases, if the renovation is large scale, those totals aren't even in the share numbers. So the share numbers we've been quoting are same store on the same comp set. So it's really not, that's not really what's driving. And we did gain share across the board and in all brands. So it's pretty, it's really not isolated to those renovations.","And then the other thing I'd say is in those brands and a couple of others, we still have a bunch of those hotels that are still under renovation. So we have ones that are coming out, but we still have, in some cases, up to 25% of the portfolio in the U.S. that are still under renovation. So that benefit should continue. But again, that's really not what's driving same-store sales, same-store RevPAR index gains.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay. And just maybe one follow-up is you guys certainly continue to enjoy hefty signings, particularly this quarter. But the last several quarters, cost of construction particularly in the U.S. has been outstripping EBITDA growth or cash flow yield growth for owners. So what in your view allows new build growth to continue to remain so robust when effectively in the last 6 to 8 quarters, you would think it's becoming marginally more unappealing to a developer just given the economics of the way things are moving?","Chris Nassetta","I think that's fair to say, but then I think that is exactly right. The other thing that's been going on, in addition to cost increases that have been going at a pretty high rate, is that debt availability in the market has been declining. Now it's been, it declined for us, been relatively stable but a lot less debt available than you had seen a couple of years ago. So I think you put less money together with higher cost to build then obviously, it has an impact because the economics don't work as well.","We are actually, and so if you look at the market data, I think you're seeing less stuff generally going to construction. If you look at our data for the first quarter and what we think for the full year, we think we will put a pretty decent amount more percentage-wise under construction in the U.S. this year as compared to last. ","And so the question back to your core question, why, I think that's because our brands are, there are some stuff that's always going to get done, and just call it what it is, our brands are outperforming. They're driving higher market share. So people have businesses. Part of the business is developing properties. ","If you have very high market share even in a high-cost environment where money is a little more expensive, you can still get your yield. You're going to build it, but you're going to do it where you can get the yield, and that's going to be where you get the premium market share, and we have the premium market share. So I, we think we'll be, rooms under construction for us will be up in the low double digits this year, at least that's what our government forecasting suggests, and the first quarter was consistent with that.","Operator","The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Just following up on that net unit growth question. So net unit growth in the first quarter was up 6.9%. If my model is right, I think that's your highest growth since you went public. So congrats on that. Does that suggest there's some upward pressure on the 6.5% guidance for the year? And then on your pipeline growth, it was up 4.5%. So it's slightly lower than your NUG growth. How do you kind of translate that over? And would you expect that to kind of accelerate? Or do you expect that to decelerate as we go through the year?","Chris Nassetta","All good questions. And yes, it's true. I mean, we give you quarterly data because we report on a quarterly basis. But I would not read too much into the quarter-by-quarter in any of these metrics because it just depends on the cadence of things and holidays and how many workdays are in a quarter, et cetera. I think our expectation is what we said. We're going to deliver in the middle of the 6% to 7% range. I think actually, last year, we did have a surge at the end of the year on things that we thought would deliver at the beginning of this year. So I think we ended up at 7% last year for the record.","Kevin Jacobs","Trailing 12 months for Q4 and Q1, about the same at [roundabout].","Chris Nassetta","I think that doesn't mean that something can't, like last year happened where we had stuff fall into the quarter and get done a little sooner or a little later. I think we're comfortable with the 6.5%.","Thomas Allen","And then just on the pipeline growth coming in slightly slower than the NUG growth, is that something to think about?","Chris Nassetta","No. Again, quarter-to-quarter, I think our signings this year, again, forecasted signings will set a record this year.","Operator","The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi.","Smedes Rose","I just wanted to ask you now that there's a couple of large companies that are moving into the home-sharing business. Obviously, Marriott made its announcement yesterday. Is that something that you could see Hilton entering at some point? Or what are your thoughts overall on that?","Chris Nassetta","I'm shocked I got asked that question, actually. That is something we have, not kidding, of course. I figured we'd get asked. So that's something we've talked about on a bunch of prior quarterly calls and certainly spent a lot of time thinking about it, understanding here at Hilton. I think the short answer is at the moment, that's not something that we're pursuing. The longer answer is, which is consistent with my prior commentary is we fundamentally think that home-sharing is a different business. What we think we're in the business of is providing high-quality, consistent, branded experiences. ","That means taking products at all these various price points that have exactly the functionality that customers want, the amenities they want. We wrap it in incredible service. We also connect it all by loyalty. And as a result, we get a big premium because of the consistent high-quality nature of all these price points. Our belief is that home-sharing is just something different. It's not that it's a bad business. We just think it's a different staycation, a higher beta experience and not the premium value proposition.","We've spent a lot of time talking to our customers, and what our customers effectively at the moment tell us, and by the way, this could change, and our view could change. But our customers tell us they don't need this from us. They have places they can get this. They don't need it from us. And in a sense, they don't want it from us, which I found surprising. But that's what customers will say to us. So at the moment, what we, as you can tell from the prepared comments and the Q&A so far, I'm a big believer in focus. We have a lot of really good things going on. ","We have a lot of momentum where the market share leader now. We think that there's opportunity to extend that lead. And so we want to be focused on delivering high-quality, consistent, branded experiences in a broader and broader network to take quality, curated platform and continue to grow it in a way that customers can really rely on us to deliver great experiences. So at the moment, no. We're going to keep doing what we're doing where we think we're having great success. ","Smedes Rose","That's helpful. I just wanted to ask you, too. So you talked about Signia a little bit more this call. For the properties that are converting to that brand, I mean, so, well, we know a little bit about Bonnet Creek because it's owned by a REIT, but the other ones, are the owners putting in money to expand the group space that's there? Or is there something new that's really driven by group demand? Or is this just a way of kind of rolling up?","Chris Nassetta","The bulk of Signia, by the way, the first 3 deals, and we got a bunch of other deals we're working on, Bonnet is the only conversion with some expansion of meeting space and the renovation and upgrading of the hotel next to the Waldorf Astoria and Bonnet Creek. The other 2 are new builds part of convention centers. So they are purpose built, modern, the best modern design of meeting space, technology, et cetera. ","One in Indianapolis next to the convention center, the other in Atlanta actually. And we're doing it with the Georgia World Congress in the center there right next to Mercedes Stadium, a spectacular sight. And I suspect there may be other potential conversions. But the bulk of this brand over time is going to be new build. It's not conversion.","Operator","The next question will be from Anthony Powell of Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Can you talk about how your group production for future quarters trended in the quarter? Did they show any softness like you saw in corporate transient in March? Or was that the system with prior quarters?","Kevin Jacobs","Generally consistent, Anthony. I think our position is a little bit, a touch lower this, at the end of this quarter than it was at the end of the fourth quarter, which would imply that pace was down for the quarter. But that's normal for as you go in, as you get into the year, the bulk of the year is spoken for in terms of capacity and bookings. And so as you get further into the year, the position tends to migrate down to where you're going to realize for the year. So it was technically a bit softer, but that was to be expected. And we still think the group will be the strongest of the 3 segments as well.","Chris Nassetta","Yes. And the position on the books right now supports where we think we'll end up from a forecasting point of view in group RevPAR gains.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, all within expectations.","Chris Nassetta","All the lines.","Anthony Powell","Got it. And capital allocation question focused on the dividend. It's been $0.15 a quarter for the past few quarters even as EPS and your stock price has gone up. I think you've talked about keeping your competitive yield. Is that still the case? And can we see a dividend increase this year?","Kevin Jacobs","I don't know. We just kept it the same, as you pointed out. So we'd have to talk to our Board about any increases as well. But I don't think we would intend to increase it. I mean, the way Chris talked about earlier in the Q&A session, we like the returns on buying out the stock. We think that having the dividend is important. It attracts yield investors. We're not getting a lot of feedback from investors about the level of the dividend and that they think it should be higher. And frankly, we think we drive higher equity returns by taking the incremental dollar and buying back more stock.","Chris Nassetta","I think that's right. If you look at it over the long term, we were thinking about how do we drive outperformance over the next 5 or 10 years. If you model it, I think it's a very convincing model that says allocate as much of our return of capital to buybacks as we can given the strength and resiliency of the underlying model. So that's what we're doing, and I wouldn't expect any increases anytime soon on dividends.","Operator","The next question will be from David Katz of Jefferies.","David Katz","Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to just go back to Smedes' question and your answer just a little bit. I recognize that there is a boundary and perhaps a slippery slope where getting into the sort of shared economy in some way is contiguous to what you do, right? And on the one side of the argument is, hey, our customers are doing this, but they're also, like, driving cars, it doesn't mean you should be selling those. But there is an argument that is impacting share in some way, right? That it is impacting the ability to charge for that last room under certain circumstances and so forth. Do you see that barrier over time changing? Or is this just for now, it's just not, it's a different business, not something we want to be in?","Chris Nassetta","I think it's the latter. I mean, and I tried to say it in my long-winded response. It's not something that we have, that's in concrete. I mean, this is fast-moving sort of the view of the sharing economy broadly and certainly as it relates to our industry. That's why I say, I always start with we spent a lot of time on it because we have. And so it's a dynamic thing as we see what other folks are doing competitively, not just the folks that are in our industry directly but other new entrants or Airbnb or VRBO or anybody else. We're watching it very carefully, and we'll judge it over time. As we judge it today, which is the question that I believe I got asked, I gave you my answer, which is we do not believe it justifies our entry into the space at the moment and that we should take our focus away from the things that we're working on that are going well.","Operator","The next question will be from Gregory Miller of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Gregory Miller","I'm on the line for Patrick Scholes. Looking at the international growth markets for hotels, a lot of the focus in Asia Pacific is on China. Heading South a bit, where do you see India today from the development landscape? How the pipeline is trending given the current GDP growth in that country?","Chris Nassetta","Yes. I mean, we obviously are very active in India. I was just there, I don't know, a few weeks, maybe it was a little bit longer ago than that and get there multiple times a year. We have a fabulous team there, and we're making really good progress. We have sort of, I mean, in a relative sense to our scale and to the size of the population, we are quite small in India. I think we have circa 20 hotels open. We've got another, more than that in the pipeline or in production in various ways. I think given you have 1.3 billion people, the economy is growing at a strong rate, and they are really transforming their economy. It's a place you got to be, you want to be, both from like China from the standpoint of the business in India but also from the standpoint of outbound business coming out of India to the rest of the world. ","If that economy grows just like every other economy, they're going to go traveling around the world, and we want them to have loyalty to our brand. So we are making, I would say, really good progress from sort of a standing start years ago. It's slow going, I think, for all of us in the industry, but an important market and one that we are investing in with a great team and with great relationships with the cadre of Honors that are doing, that are building us fantastic products. We opened a couple of luxury hotels in there in the last few years, and they're doing really well, the Conrad in Pune and the Conrad in Bangalore that are real iconic properties to help, in addition to some Hilton hotels sort of build our presence there. But you will continue to see us grinding in India and over time, getting bigger and bigger in that market because it's an important market for our network effect. But it will not move as quickly, notwithstanding some of the reforms in the economic growth. It will not move anytime soon as quickly as other markets around the world, including China, just because it's a much more laborious sort of process to, from start to finish to get a hotel in the operation.","Gregory Miller","And just a follow-up going back on the domestic market, I want to ask you about Tru. I know you had a number of hotels that are open and strong initial rollout. I'm curious if you have taken some potentially initial customer feedback and made some revisions to the prototype or planned versions to prototype now that you're continuing to progress along with that brand expansion.","Kevin Jacobs","Yes, we have, Greg. I mean, as is typical for us when we, when you actually launch, you get real-life feedback versus just creating the hotel in a lab and guessing as to what customers are going to think, although we're pretty good at that as well. But I think the biggest thing we did was we added a desk, so that's a good example of feedback where we've gotten a lot of customer feedback through the process of creating the brand that people like to hang out in their beds and use their laptops, and they don't need their desks. ","They don't need the desk. It turns out they do. And then we made changes to the F&B program, particularly the breakfast offering, as we got feedback from customers. So it's all going really well. We've got over 60 of them open now. We think we'll have another 60 open this year. And we've got over, well over 500 working deals and growing, and so everything is going great.","Operator","The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin Farley","I've been hopping around between calls, so I don't think that you gave this color, but I apologize if you did. I know your fee revenue was up 12%, and that is more than maybe unit and RevPAR growth would suggest. I think you mentioned that licensing fees were a driver. But can you go into a little bit more detail in terms of is that credit card fees higher? Or were there contract cancellation fees? And then I assume that, that $10 million of timing items, is that why the Q2 fee guidance is like a little bit below the full year run rate?","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. Good question, Robin. We actually haven't been asked that thus far, and I did talk about it in prepared remarks, but you might have been on that other call then. But yes, $10 million of timing items is really largely one fee related to a property that's being redeveloped in New York, and it's a rather large property that's being redeveloped. Hopefully, we'll be a part of that redevelopment. But for now, the building is coming down, so we would do a rather large payment there. ","So that was the large, largely the timing out. And then the core beat was driven by license fees across the board, a little, mostly with the credit card fees, and so that accounted for the beat. And then, yes, the timing of them, obviously, carries over into the second quarter. We left our fee guidance at 7% to 9% for the year. ","Obviously, if we had about $20 million of increases in EBITDA coming in and RevPAR the same, that $20 million is largely going into the fee segment. So our expectations for the fee segment are higher, but they still ended up within the range. And with a little bit of rounding, we decided to leave it at 7% and 9%. Does that cover your question?","Robin Farley","No, that's great. And just to clarify, the higher credit card fees in Q1 was, so without the full year rates is maybe some like a nonrecurring factor maybe just like an increase in...","Kevin Jacobs","No. No. Credit card fees outperform in the first quarter. And actually, we think we, actually, that was part of the increase in the core increase in guidance. It was partially operational with some of the things that Chris mentioned earlier with performance in Japan and a little bit of performance in greater London. But some of it was credit card fees as well.","Robin Farley","Okay. No, that's great. And just one small thing. The difference in your EPS guidance before and after special items, one went up a few cents, one went down a few cents. What was that other expense or that piece of special? Because the special item that, and I think you don't normally guide to that, but that was a bit more than it was a quarter ago. So just wondering if...","Kevin Jacobs","Yes. The, after special items is really at this point what we would have you focus on for a bunch of reasons historically but even more so now post revenue recognition. So the special items increase was really commensurate with the increase in our overall guidance. And then EPS, I think what you're talking about EPS for the quarter was a little bit light, and that relates to the other management franchise fees line item, which is the reimbursables from the hotels and the various funded programs. Post revenue recognition, those, we have not been able to equalize those, so we run through revenues as incurred. We run through expenses as incurred. And so in some quarters, that's going to be a benefit. In some quarters, it's going to be harm. And so that, and we neutralized that in special items, and so that's why the special items guidance is more in concert with our overall changes in guidance.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.","Chris Nassetta","We'll make this short because I know there are other calls going on. Appreciate your time today. We're obviously pleased with the first quarter. I think we had some good momentum going into the rest of the year. We look forward to talking with everybody after we complete the second quarter. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. "]}}
