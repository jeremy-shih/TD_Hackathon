At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call will be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Liza Sabol, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings conference call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; and Senior Vice President of Finance, Jim Skulina.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks and replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com. It should also be noted that our Form 10-Q will be filed tomorrow and will also be found on our website.","Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that the statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC found through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","We'd also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks to everybody for calling in today. Today I'll start off with a brief overview of our recent organization announcements, some summary and comments on our consistent strategy, a quick overview summary of the third quarter and fiscal year 2018. Kevin will review the business performance for the quarter and the year; and Jim will then run through the financials.","As you may have seen, we recently announced three significant organization changes. Mike Lisman has been elected by the board to be our new Chief Financial Officer. Mike brings a very attractive set of skills and experience to the new job. His experience in private equity and investment banking provides a key element to our new management team.","Mike has worked with us for about three years in both operations and M&A roles. He knows the company and culture well. Interestingly, Mike has a degree in aerospace engineering. So like Kevin, Bernie, Jorge, and I can help with engineering work in a pinch. That's a joke by the way.","Unverified Participant","Yeah. I hope so.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not that he has a degree, but he can help. Mike is a good cultural fit and a great candidate. Kevin and I both believe he's going to do a fine job. Bernie Iversen will continue to report to me and remains Executive Vice President of Merger & Acquisition. Jim Skulina has agreed to continue as Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer for a six to 12-month period to assist Mike in the transition.","Jorge Valladares has been elected by the Board of Directors as the Chief Operating Officer of our Power Systems segment. Jorge came to TransDigm almost right out of college and has been with the company in a broad range of operating positions for about 20 years. Jorge is a proven executive and an outstanding cultural fit. Kevin will expand on this a little.","Now to reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry both in its consistency and its ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize why we believe that, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products. Over three-quarters of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability in the downturns. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.","To do that, we follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple well-proven value-based operating methodology. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that very closely aligns our management with the shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit our strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and allocation as a key part of our value creation methodology.","As you know, we regularly review our choices for capital allocation. We basically have four. And our priorities are typically as follows: One, invest in our existing business; two, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy and return requirements. These are almost always our first choices. Our third is to give extra money back to the shareholders either through a special dividend or a stock buyback. And our last priority is to pay off the debt. Given the low cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions.","Depending on the specific business and capital market, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders. So far in fiscal year 2018, we have spent about $660 million on acquisitions. In March of fiscal year 2018, we announced two acquisitions, Kirkhill and Extant, for about $575 million. They both fit our strategy well. In July, we announced the acquisition of Skandia for about $84 million. All these deals meet our PE-like return requirements.","We continue active in M&A with a pretty good pipeline. But as usual, I cannot predict or comment on possible closings or any specific business situations. We'll continue to look at our options for capital allocation. The credit market remains strong and reasonably accommodating. Our fiscal year ends on September 30. We'll see where things stand after the start of our new fiscal year and likely make some decisions on capital allocation during the first quarter of our next fiscal year.","Our liquidity is strong. We had $1.85 billion of cash at the end of Q3, and absent any additional acquisitions beyond Skandia or other capital market activities, we expect to have about $2 billion in cash at 9\/30\/2018. We also have roughly $600 million of undrawn revolver and room under our credit agreement. Our Q3 and year-to-date operations; that is, revenue, EBITDA As Adjusted and EPS as adjusted were strong and up nicely over last year. Commercial aftermarket revenues are encouraging. On a year-to-date basis, they're up about 11% versus the prior year.","As we told you, the first half seemed to be running a bit hot to us. The rate of growth slowed down a little in Q3, but the underlying drivers still look good. Year after year, defense bookings are also up nicely. Based on the year-to-date results, we've adjusted our revenue and EBITDA As Defined guidance midpoint up a bit. This primarily reflects improved operating performance of our businesses.","In summary, fiscal year 2018 looks like a good year. I'm confident, though, with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our shareholders.","And now, let me hand this over to Kevin who will discuss in more color and detail for both the quarter and the year-to-date performance as well as expand on the year-to-date guidance. Kevin?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick, and thanks for joining the call this morning. As you've seen, we had a strong third quarter. Jim will provide more details on the financials, but our third quarter and year-to-date operations in revenue and EBITDA As Defined were up nicely over last year and ran a little ahead of our expectations. Q3 GAAP revenues were up 9% versus prior-year Q3 and up 7% versus prior year-to-date. EBITDA As Defined margin ran close to 50% of revenue in both periods.","Now let's review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide some commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2017. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. Please note, this analysis excludes the recent acquisitions of Kirkhill and Skandia.","In the commercial markets, which makes up close to 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. In our commercial OEM market, Q3 revenues increased approximately 1% when compared with Q3 of fiscal year 2017. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the majority of our commercial OEM business, were down slightly in Q3 when compared to the prior year period.","As was the case last quarter, the vast majority of this (00:10:39) softness is attributed to weakness in the wide-body market and the impact these reductions or delays have on the extended supply chain. As was the case in previous quarters, commercial transport OEM sales can fluctuate from time to time, but at its core, our shipset content remains robust, so any softness is simply timing related.","Business jet and helicopter OEM revenues make up about 15% of our commercial OEM revenues. In total, year-to-date revenues in this market grew in the low-teens percentage range compared to the same period in 2017. Growth was driven by strength in both business jet and helicopter segments, with the helicopter market picking up significantly in the quarter. Year-to-date bookings versus shipments were up even more than revenue growth.","Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by an approximate 8% in the quarter. Commercial transport aftermarket, which makes up about 85% of our total commercial aftermarket, revenues in Q3 fiscal year 2018 were up 7% over the prior year period and up 11% year-to-date.","For the freight aftermarket, we are running year-to-date ahead of the average with the interiors aftermarket below average but starting to show signs of recovery. In general, continued global revenue passenger mile growth and a generally positive economic environment seem to provide a backdrop of improved market dynamics.","Finally, for the business jet\/helicopter aftermarket, which accounts for the final 15% of revenue in our total commercial aftermarket, year-to-date sales growth was up in the high-single digit percentage range. This was the second sequential quarter of solid growth in this end-market after an extended period of softness.","Business jet takeoff and landing cycles and used business jet inventories continue their modest improvement from previous quarters, albeit still well off of their peak performance, but clearly, key market indicators have improved.","As a reminder, the aftermarket in this segment tends to go through the OEM, and as such, we do not have the same level of insight into this market segment. So cautious optimism remains for this market segment.","Now let me speak about our defense market, which is just over 30% of our total revenue. The defense market, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, was up slightly more than 4% over the prior year Q3. Once again, strong defense aftermarket revenue growth was tempered by slower defense OEM shipments, although the OEM was stronger than we have seen in recent quarters. The vast majority of the defense OEM market softness can be tied to declines in A400M build rates.","Total defense bookings continue to provide an encouraging narrative as bookings were up nicely year-to-date over prior year and have similarly outpaced sales year-to-date. This expansion is characterized by modest OEM bookings growth and stronger aftermarket bookings performance.","Year-to-date, total defense market sales and bookings are well distributed and appear to be coming from most businesses that support defense-related platforms. Defense orders can be booked as far out as two years, so the timing of the related shipments can be difficult to predict as actual shipment dates can be delayed based upon a number of factors.","Now moving on to profitability, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. EBITDA As Defined of about $487 million for Q3 was up 9% versus prior Q3 and $1.35 billion, or up 8% on a year-to-date basis. The As Defined adjustments in Q3 were primarily non-cash compensation expense and acquisition-related costs and amortizations.","Q3 2018 EBITDA As Defined margin came in just under 50% of revenues at 49.7%. This includes about 1 margin point of dilution from the recent acquisitions of Kirkhill and Extant. Excluding the acquisitions, margins improved over 0.5 percentage points year-over-year for the same period. Margin improvement progress is always important to us and indicates that our base businesses continue to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers.","Now let me turn to 2018 guidance, which is found on slide 6 of your presentation. Based on our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter, we are adjusting our guidance for the year. The midpoint of our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance is increased by $20 million to $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting improvement in our base business.","This revenue guidance is based on the following slightly revised market channel growth rate assumptions: we now expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth of high-single digit percent versus prior year, this is an increase from our assumptions from last quarter; commercial OEM revenues are now expected to be roughly flat with prior year, this is a modest decrease from our prior guidance; and we are maintaining defense, military revenue growth at up a mid-single digit percent versus prior year.","The midpoint of fiscal year 2018 EBITDA As Defined guidance increased by $15 million to $1.87 billion. Again, most of this increase is due to improved operational performance across our businesses.","The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be $17.61 per share, decreased by $0.06 per share from our last guidance. This decrease in guidance is due to improved EBITDA As Defined, offset by higher interest expense. Jim will discuss in more detail shortly.","I would now like to comment on a few items, including Boeing's latest Partnering for Success agreement, executive leadership changes and Skandia. First, I am pleased to announce that in July we successfully completed negotiations and have executed commercial agreements that last into the next decade with Boeing. This was part of Boeing's Partnering for Success initiative.","The new agreements continue a long-standing partnership between our companies, encompassing aircraft production and aftermarket support. While the specific details of our agreements are confidential, they represent a win-win for both parties \u2013 for both of our companies and reinforce our commitment to operational excellence and focus on maximizing performance and providing innovative engineered products for existing and future Boeing platforms. We do not expect that this will have any material impact on our financial performance as a result of this mutually beneficial agreement. Again, due to our confidentiality agreement, this will be our only comment on the subject, similar to our last Boeing PFS agreement.","Secondly, as Nick mentioned, we have recently announced a few executive management changes. I will not comment further on our promotion of Mike Lisman to CFO but to say how excited I am to have him in this new role as it further augments our private equity-like value-driven culture.","I would like to expand on the promotion of Jorge Valladares to Chief Operating Officer of our Power Group. All of our Power Group businesses now report to Jorge, along with several executive vice presidents. Jorge will continue to report directly to me as will the remaining businesses in the Airframe Group and the other EVPs. This will keep me intimately involved in our operations while we continue our deliberate succession plan.","Jorge is steeped in our TransDigm culture and moves into this position after serving four years as an Executive Vice President. Prior to that, Jorge held the position of President at Avtech Tyee and AdelWiggins. Jorge initially started with the AdelWiggins Group and held various positions of increasing levels of management responsibility in engineering, manufacturing and sales.","Now, finally in July, we closed the acquisition of Skandia, a leading provider of highly engineered seating foam, foam fabrication, flammability testing and acoustic solutions for the business jet market. Headquartered in Davis Junction, Illinois, Skandia's annual revenues are approximately $26 million and the company currently employs about 70 people.","It is too early in our integration process to provide any specific color on this acquisition. However, we do expect this business to create equity value well in line with our long-term private equity-type return objectives. Next quarter, we will provide you an update on the integration progress of Kirkhill and Extant and our initial thoughts on Skandia.","So let me conclude by stating, all-in-all, Q3 of fiscal year 2018 was another solid quarter for TransDigm.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our Senior Vice President of Finance, Jim Skulina.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I will now review the third quarter financial results. Third quarter net sales were $981 million, up $83 million or approximately 9% greater than the prior year. Organic sales were up 4.4%. The balance of the sales increase was from our recent acquisitions, primarily Kirkhill and Extant.","Our third quarter gross profit was $570 million, an increase of approximately 10%. Our reported gross profit of 58.1% was modestly higher than the prior year margin of 57.9%. This was due to several puts and takes. First, dilutive impact of the acquisition mix and the acquisition-related costs decreased gross profit percent by just under 2 margin points. This was offset by the margin expansion in our existing businesses due to the strength of our proprietary products as well as a favorable product mix.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.5% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12% in the prior year. Interest expense increased by approximately $15 million, up 10% versus the prior-year quarter. This is a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt of $12.4 billion in the current quarter versus $11.2 billion in the prior year.","During the quarter, we were very busy in the capital markets. We successfully raised $1.2 billion of incremental debt, including $500 million of new senior subordinated notes and $700 million in additional tranche E term loans. The proceeds were used to replenish cash used to fund the purchase price of Kirkhill and Extant, with the remainder of the net proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, which include future acquisitions, dividends, or share repurchases.","In addition, we repriced $5.1 billion of existing term loans to lower rates from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 2.5%. We extended the term of our tranche E term loans and the revolver, and we entered into additional hedges to align the new term loans and extended maturities on existing debt to remain approximately 75% fixed through 2025. We now expect our full-year interest expense to be approximately $670 million. This estimate reflects the impact of all of our third quarter financing activities.","Now, moving on to taxes, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Job Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] (00:22:32) in December 2017. That significantly reduced our expected effective tax rate for fiscal 2018. As a result, the effective GAAP tax rate was 18.1% for the current quarter compared to 28% in the prior year quarter.","We are now estimating our full-year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 4%, the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 9% and the cash tax rate to be approximately 15%. The estimated GAAP and cash tax rates were lowered this quarter, primarily due to higher excess tax benefits in stock option exercises. In fiscal 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 21% and 23%.","Our net income from continuing operations in the quarter increased $48 million or 28% to $217 million, which is 22% of sales. This compares to net income of $170 million or 19% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense versus the prior period.","GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $3.91 per share in the current quarter compared to $3.09 per share last year. Our adjusted net income for the quarter rose 20.8% to $223.2 million or $4.01 per share from $184.7 million or $3.37 per share in the comparable quarter a year ago.","Adjusted earnings per share in the current fiscal year includes $0.42 of favorable impact from the enactment of the tax reform. Excluding this favorable tax impact, current earnings per share of $3.59 increased 6.5% over the prior year. Please refer to Table 3 of this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity, we generated approximately $691 million of cash from operating activities year-to-date and ended the quarter with approximately $1.85 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This quarter-end cash balance does not reflect the payment of approximately $84 million for the acquisition of Skandia, which occurred in July. Our net debt leverage ratio for quarter-end was 6.1 times pro forma EBITDA As Defined and gross leverage was 7.1 times pro forma EBITDA.","With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $15.84. And as Kevin previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $17.61. The increase at the midpoint of the GAAP EPS was due to the increase in EBITDA As Defined and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. The increase of the midpoint of the adjusted EPS was due to two factors. The largest was the increase in EBITDA As Defined. This was partially reduced by higher interest expense. Please see slide 9 for a bridge detail on the $1.77 of adjustments between GAAP to adjusted earnings per share related to our guidance.","I will now hand this back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you. We ask that you limit your questions to two per person and then please reinsert yourself into the queue to allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Robert Stinegarn (sic) [Robert Spingarn] (00:26:18) with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","A couple things. First, on the organic sales, I think you said those were 4% plus growth in the quarter. But assuming fair amount of that is pricing, is it fair to conclude that volumes were flattish overall?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think so. I think it's fair to assume that the volumes were flattish overall.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, Kevin, following up on that, if volumes are flattish, and reconciling to this wide-body pressure that you showed in your results and you've talked about, how is that possible with 87 and 350 (00:27:00) ramping? The OE also includes ramping narrow-body. I just \u2013 struggling to reconcile where the pressure's coming from. Is it timing? Is it 777?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's timing. It's 777. It's some other program delays. I think it's across the board. We've gone through and looked at all the places that we've missed versus expectations, and everything correlates back to A380 declines and inventory adjustments, 777 declines and adjustments and on it goes.","The encouraging piece for us is that bookings in the commercial transport OEM are starting to improve a little bit. We saw some nice rebound in bookings in Q3 there. So I think this is just a timing-related function that our shipset content hasn't changed on these, and it just has to come through the system.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just to follow up, Kevin, is another element of this where you get pricing on the aftermarket, you're getting the opposite on the OE? So, to the extent that we see 10% type increases in narrow-bodies and on a couple of those wide-body lines something similar, you're actually going the other way on pricing?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, we don't comment on the individual pieces of price. So I don't want to get into the slicing and dicing of that. But again, I think we're looking forward and saying this should be a better story going forward due to the bookings.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Nick or Kevin, first on the aftermarket. Strong result year-to-date, up 11%. How much of that do you think is being influenced by the unusually low rate of old aircraft retirement and the lack of surplus parts that are out there at the moment?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's hard for me to comment. It'd just be speculation, but I'm positive it doesn't hurt our case to have less retirements out there. But I don't know the exact correlation.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think I might just add, on the surplus stuff, we did a fair amount of work on that whenever it was, Kevin, a year or two ago...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, two years ago.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...and talked about it. The amount of surplus sold for our product is very small. So, hard to believe that has any significant impact.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right. And secondly, on the quarter-end cash balance, unusually high for TransDigm. Does that reflect some opportunistic timing in terms of taking out the debt here? Or was it something else going on?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Rob, I'm not quite sure I follow your question. We borrowed, as you know, a little more than \u2013 we borrowed and essentially we replenished what we spent for the $600 million of acquisition, reloaded that again. We'll do what we normally do. If we don't buy anything, we'll have a couple billion dollars at the end of the year. We'll see where things stand. And if we don't see a good use for it, we'd probably pay something out the beginning of next year.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. So, it's just sort of normal practice, then, is the way to think of that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, right.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And we'll see what comes along. I mean, we're fairly busy. We see opportunity. We'll see how things unwind here. As I think you know, we don't sit on money too long.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah, exactly. All right. Thanks for everything.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Nick, just following up on that, in your prepared remarks, you actually specifically said that you'll make some decisions on capital allocation during the first quarter of next fiscal year.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So should we read that to mean you will either be making an acquisition or announcing a special dividend by the end of 1Q 2019 (00:31:35)?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I wouldn't \u2013 no, I wouldn't want to get nailed down that much. I'd say we'd make a decision. The decision could be we'll make a decision next quarter, but as you know, if we don't see something moving along. I mean, that's the best I can tell you, is if we don't see something moving along, we don't sit on the money very long. If we have $2 billion and significant capacity, and we don't see some decent deals, we do something.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Yeah, I wasn't trying to nail you down.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I hate to back into a corner on that (00:32:08).","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, and I didn't mean to attempt to back you into a corner. I actually was just a little surprised by the specificity of the comments in your prepared remarks.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","But understood.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, and that may be a good point. What I really was trying to say is we probably aren't going to do anything for the next 60 days or so.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I maybe oversold the point.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Glad to clarify that. And then just one other. On the defense business, if I strip out what I believe you do roughly in price in the business, it looks like units were kind of flattish in the quarter and has maybe been flattish a few quarters in a row. And I was just kind of reading back through your order commentary on the end market, and it's now been several quarters in a row where the order commentary has been quite robust. DoD Treasury outlays were up well into the double digits in the quarter. Maybe you could parse out a little bit more? I mean, I know there can be long lead times in the business. You mentioned the A400M. But, perhaps, you could give us a little more on why it looks like you are trailing the market a little bit there right now.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I will comment on what I see in our business. The defense aftermarket is strong in sales and in bookings. Defense OEM, a little less so. The defense business bookings and including shipments can be very lumpy. You can be impacted by delays in contracts and budgets. There's a number of factors that go into this. So it's always difficult to predict when these bookings will come out as sales.","Clearly, this is a good position to be in that we're building up some backlog specifically in the aftermarket side but \u2013 and on the OEM side of defense. This will eventually come out. It just takes time. And it's why we don't emphasize the defense side as much, because it's difficult to predict when this will all come out as shipments. There are many delays and movements in when things can be shipped even though there are bookings associated with it. So I don't know about trailing market or not. For our shipset of business, this continues to look robust and encouraging as we look into the future.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, Kevin, do you feel like you have a reasonably high probability of the rate of organic growth in that segment accelerating for you next year versus this year?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think, yes. I think, we should expect that given \u2013 I mean, all of these bookings have to come out sometime.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I am as curious about it as you are as to when all this will come out. We do look at this regularly, and it's just difficult to predict. But I would anticipate things will get better here.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And you'll have a forecast when you go through next year's guidance.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right. Next quarter, we'll give you some guidance.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, that's why I asked sort of from a probability perspective. But I appreciate the comments, guys. Thanks so much.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I understand why you asked for sure.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","I was hoping, Kevin, maybe you could comment on aftermarket trends more recently because we've heard of some capacity cuts being planned.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You're breaking up. I can't really hear the question. Can you repeat that?","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Sure. Can you hear me now?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You're still fading in and out.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Oh, jeez. Okay. I'll try one last time. Hopefully it works. I'm wondering if you had any comments on trends in aftermarket bookings late in the quarter and early in this quarter, just given some of the capacity cuts announced by U.S. airlines.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I believe you're asking about have we seen a difference in aftermarket bookings or activity because of slowdowns at the end of the quarter beginning of this quarter. Is that your question?","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't believe we've seen any of that, but I'm not sure. I look at it granularly enough on the week-to-week basis to have seen that. But there's nothing that has been highlighted that there has been any difference that I have seen in the aftermarket at the end of the quarter.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, afternoon, guys.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Kevin, can you talk a little bit about Kirkhill and how that's going? And when you look out in the market for other opportunities, that one seems like it was like pretty low-hanging fruit. I mean, are there other opportunities? And maybe more specifically are there other opportunities from that same tree?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I don't know. I'll let Nick comment on whether there's other opportunities from the tree. I think Kirkhill has been a good acquisition for TransDigm, and we believe it will deliver the private equity-like returns we're looking for. So we're confident in that. I would tell you that it's still taking some time to understand some of the market segmentation and to determine where some of the opportunities are to improve. I will tell you that so far so good.","I'll give you more of an update next quarter as we have more to update. We have only owned the business for a short period of time; really took control at the beginning of June, if I remember right. So there's a limit on how much we can comment so far. There's still a lot of the integration ongoing. But everything we've seen, this is encouraging, and we would certainly entertain other opportunities like that.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And maybe as a follow-on question from \u2013 a couple of other people tried to ask this different ways, but I'll just be more direct. I think investors are trying to get their head around, we're seeing the commercial aftermarket business broadly surging for a lot of different companies. Why isn't it surging for you guys?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's not. So, we're up double-digits year-to-date in aftermarket. Hard for me to comment on that, defend that, but our total commercial aerospace aftermarket is up 11% year-to-date.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I think our POS so far year-to-date, we're seeing modest improvements over what we've seen in prior quarters on POS. So it's running above the 11% rate that I discussed. I think we're seeing it.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not sure that we're not.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from with Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Kevin, when you mentioned some of the pressure that you're seeing, you mentioned both wide-body production rate reductions and delays as pressuring OE sales. Do the delays refer solely to the wide-body programs as well, or is that a broader phenomenon?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It refers to wide-bodies. We've seen some selective slowdowns in narrow-bodies here and there, but nothing to really comment on. The main driver is wide-body.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And it's true across all \u2013 really all wide-body platforms. Yeah.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe just following up a little bit on Ron's question, it seems like the guidance implies kind of a 6%-ish growth number for aftermarket in the fourth quarter. And so when you look at what makes that up, kind of where is the deceleration coming from in terms of the double-digit growth we saw in the first half to...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...the kind of 6% to 8% for the second half?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I understand the question, where you're coming from on that, and maybe we're being too conservative in this. But my goal is to not get out ahead of ourselves. We told everyone last quarter that we thought things were running a little too hot, and we were a little bit lower this last quarter. I don't know where it's going to come in. The order book continues to look strong. This is just our forecast from what we see and our desire to be a little conservative in this market segment.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Just following-up there on the aftermarket. Obviously, the comp was more difficult here year-over-year in the third quarter. Sequentially, Kevin, was the aftermarket up, flat, or down in the quarter?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Was it up, flat, or down? I'm looking at that. Aftermarket was up a little. A little.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then following up on Seth's question, so on the narrow-body seg, are you seeing anything related to kind of the ramp-up issues that both Airbus and Boeing seem to be having on narrow-bodies in general but also in particular on the new narrow-body side?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not really. I would say that I'm not hearing any trends or concerns across the company that any kind of engine delays or issues in the extended supply chain are causing us any problems that I can see on narrow-bodies. Yeah, so nothing that we've seen.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And last one for me, your margin performance in the quarter was really good. I think you said adjusted EBITDA margins from the base business were up 50 bps. Was that just mix, or was there anything kind of exceptional in that number?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's mix and operational performance. It's ongoing what we do day in and day out to drive value, drive our performance in our business productivity and the like. So I can't point to any one thing, which is good. It goes across all of our businesses in the organization.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Nick, Kevin. Congratulations, Mike. Hey, Kevin, I guess, this is just more of a clarification because we talked a lot about the OEM. So just circling back to, I think, Rob's original question, so it sounds like the takeaway is this is all timing related and then ultimately, I know you're not giving 2019 guidance, but you would expect commercial OEM to be up when we're thinking about these rate increases next year?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We'll provide next year's guidance next quarter. I haven't seen it all come in. But yeah, this is a wide-body phenomenon. Again, we haven't lost any shipset content. This is 100% timing related and we'll give you some more guidance next quarter for the following year. But I see this as a timing related phenomenon.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just, Nick, just a bigger picture question. I guess, defense is now 35% of the mix, and I know M&A is very deal-specific and has to meet your criteria. But is there a natural cap on how big you would let the defense exposure get if you saw the right deals?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, we don't look at deals based on whether defense or commercial. We look at them whether they meet our proprietary aerospace significant aftermarket, our criteria and whether we get the return. We have, obviously, seen more attractive defense stuff the last year or so than we did in the past, not surprisingly. I don't know that we have a hard limit. We sure wouldn't want \u2013 we don't want to turn this into a defense company. So I mean, I think we kind of like the range we're in. But whether it's 35% or 37% or 32%, I don't know, makes a whole lot of difference.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","(00:46:04) in for Michael. Just to go on to the A220 Airbus, the CSeries, Airbus commenting that they're asking for 20% price concessions from current suppliers. Any impact for you guys there?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I've read that as well, but I have not heard of any requests or changes for us. The CSeries is a great program. We hope that it's a very successful platform. But I have not heard of any concrete requests or changes for us.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks. On the aftermarket interior side, you commented that you've seen some color on recovery there. What's driving it? I mean, is it interior retrofit activity (00:46:54), any impacts on the Pexco and Schneller product lines for you?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, the interiors business is really Schneller and Pexco largely. So as we look at that, we've seen a slowdown in some of the OEM programs on the interior side as they are doing fleet refurbishments, rebranding campaigns and the like, as well as some of those refurbishments. But what we are seeing pick up quite dramatically is the repairs and upkeep of the interiors that were put in over the last couple years. So our interiors business has, from the aftermarket side, has recovered nicely in the last quarter and having a decent year. I think really ahead of our expectations on the interior side on the aftermarket.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Got it. Thank you. Actually one more if I may, on the supply chain side, I mean, we've heard a number of industry participants commenting that they're seeing some constraints or, perhaps, bottlenecks. Any impact for you guys, perhaps, looking at raw materials, maybe even components? Any impact, any color there that we can add?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. I don't have any color that concerns. We monitor our on-time delivery, our days delinquent, how we're doing in servicing our customers across the business, and we're not seeing any dramatic dips across the company in on-time delivery performance. We're not seeing problems sourcing raw materials. But you have to also understand where we are in the supply chain. Maybe simpler at the beginning, and so maybe not an issue for us. So I'm not hearing any real complaints on capacity or ability to produce right now at the rates that we have.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's safe to say, Kevin, we're not having to stretch out our lead times significantly...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We are not. We're not doing that.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...which you think you'd see if that was happening.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. And you might also see your on-time delivery dip. And you do see that once in a while in a business that has a surge, but everyone recovers quickly. I haven't seen any problem here.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you for the additional color, guys.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning. Hey, Nick, what kind of a correlation have you seen between fuel prices and commercial aftermarket spend as in the level of correlation or maybe a lag? And how are you planning for higher fuel prices as you think about how your customers budget their own discretionary spend for 2019?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know how to correlate it. And I don't know that we've seen a great correlation. Obviously, when your customer is not as profitable, you'd prefer your customer will be more profitable. But I don't know that we've seen any particular correlation, and I don't know how we really plan for it. I guess, that's probably like all I know to say about it.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we react to the...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...orders that come in and deal with it. In terms of predicting that, it's difficult. There doesn't seem to be a lot of correlations possible there.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And we haven't seen any there.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Yeah, I guess, I was just wondering if you were in regular contact with your customers around their own planning process, so you're not sort of caught by surprise because it can be a lumpy business.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We are in constant contact with our customers, but we're not talking about their necessarily planning needs long-term on this and how fuel prices may impact them. But we certainly are talking about what they need, what their issues are, and how we can help them.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But that hasn't been an overwhelming point of discussion.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then \u2013 and maybe a little bit more on that. Could you tell us a little bit about discretionary spend to the extent that you can? Maybe how much of your sales come through, like, multi-quarter, under the umbrella of this all being discretionary, like multi-quarter improvement projects versus sort of like one-off things that may kind of be lumpy and come in through sort of like master purchase agreements or something that you may have with a customer?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know how to answer that question. We don't look at our data that way. So \u2013 and I don't want to speculate or guess on that. So I don't really have a good answer for you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I think we can say the vast majority of our aftermarket is not lumpy special project business. It's stuff they order due to activity.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And anything \u2013 one business is lumpy one year, but someone else may be lumpy the next. So it has a tendency to average out. But beyond that, I don't know how to answer that question.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Morning. EBITDA grew 9% in the quarter in line with the top line. How do we think about timing of EBITDA acceleration? And are there any material cost or mix headwinds or offsets with the Kirkhill we should be thinking about?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know of any headwinds or issues that we have to think about right now. So, I continue to see us improving margins as we go forward in line with our guidance that we've provided. The value drivers continue to show the same level of engagement as always on price, productivity, and profitable new business. So I don't see any change.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Kevin. And then just one more on aftermarket. Is this sort of a normalized high single-digit rate we should be thinking about now that interiors is picking up and freight is probably normalizing off the highs?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Can you repeat that question, Sheila? I missed a couple of words there.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Sorry. No, no, no. It's my fault. On commercial aftermarket, is the high single-digit growth rate what we should be thinking about on a normalized basis now that interiors is picking up off the bottom and freight is normalizing off of very high levels?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, Sheila, we'll give next year's guidance next year. There's a lot to think about in that as we unpack it and go forward. So, can I get back to you on that...","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Sounds good.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...and give you some more concrete guidance on that as we go forward? Clearly, this isn't a bad situation as we go forward, but we need to unpack that and give you some exact numbers.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, now we've given \u2013 we gave \u2013 at the Investor Day, we've given some sense...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...of long-term growth kind of numbers...","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...that make sense, and I don't know of any reason that they don't still make sense.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Makes sense. Thank you.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Lipke with Stephens. Your line is open.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah, thank you for taking the question. I guess, can you remind us how much of your commercial aftermarket sales are engine related? And then just tied to that on the aftermarket settlement that CFM signed last week to allow the use of third-party PMA parts, how do you think this could change the aftermarket competitive landscape just in the engine piece of the aftermarket itself?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we don't slice and dice the aftermarket by engine and non-engine sellers. I would tell you that although the engine side is important for us, it's not a driver for us. So, there are opportunities there, but I don't know how to think about it beyond that. And in terms of the settlement, I don't believe there will be any impact to us in our business going forward, as that segment isn't a huge segment for us.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Just naturally for our products.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And the better growth in aftermarket that you saw in the second quarter, I think you're up 15%. How much was tied to the distribution agreement that Adams Rite signed with Wincor (00:55:37)? How much was kind of a pull forward there?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","There was some movement of distributors over the last several quarters for two businesses, specifically, but I wouldn't say that that has a material impact on our aftermarket. It's in those numbers, but I don't think it has a material impact.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","This is the last good morning you're going to get, all right? You got three minutes left, so.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Good morning, gents. Wondered if you could give us just a clarification on one of those earlier answers, Kevin, on the volumes. If you split that out and said \u2013 I think you would imply that OEM volumes were down modestly and aftermarket volumes were up modestly if we correct for price. Maybe a little bit better than that on the aftermarket depending on military volumes. But just wanted that clarification, if you could.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I don't disagree with your clarification.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Good. And then just another one on \u2013 this kind of gets to Hunter's question a little bit. When you look at buying behavior among the customer set globally in the aftermarket, are there any notable differences in behavior as you take a step around the world and look at various regions? Or are we seeing relatively coordinated activity among the customer set?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I would say that each region has its own idiosyncrasies. So they have different practices and \u2013 but it's still directionally accurate that the procedures, processes, the way people go to market, their ordering practices, I haven't seen any changes. Yes, there are some subtle differences when you go, like I said, region to region but I haven't seen any differences in anyone's approach to the market; their buying practices, their inventories, stocking, whether it's airlines or distribution. I really haven't seen any market changes.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Yeah, I'm just trying to understand, you said directionally, so when you look at bookings trends in Asia versus Europe versus U.S. versus LatAm or whatever, take your pick, directionally they're all similar is what you're saying? Or not?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I would say they're all directionally similar and dependent on the air fleet that's present in the region, so. But I think they're all directionally equal. I'm not seeing any \u2013 if your question is, are they \u2013 is one region more PMA activity than another and you don't see the same growth, we don't see those kinds of changes region-to-region. It's amazingly robust around the world and follows pretty similar practices.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I guess, it's safe to say in the last three to six, you don't see any discontinuity, I would say.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I haven't seen anything like that.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Discontinuity, whatever the practice was it is.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, nothing has really changed.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Do I \u2013 am I interested in Asia and inventory practices there and the like? Sure. But I really haven't seen anything manifest itself differently.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, sure.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, the call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please proceed ma'am.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. I would like to thank you all for calling in today and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; Chief Operating Officer of our Power Group, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. The details are contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, we would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical, in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","The Company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for presentations of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share, to those measures.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley","Good morning. Thanks to everyone for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on our consistent strategy, then an overview of our Q1 fiscal year '16, an update on our guidance, and then, Terry will run through the financials for Q1.","To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, and around three-quarters of our net sales come from products from which we believe, we are the sole source provider. Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced the higher gross margin and provided relative stability through the cycles.","Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has year in and year out generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structure flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content.","We have a simple, well proven, value-based operating strategy based on our three value driver concept; that is steady cost reduction, profitable new business, and value-based pricing. We maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system, with executive and senior management, who think, act, and are paid like owners.","We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we can see a clear path to PE like returns.","And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have four, and our priorities are typically as follows. First, is to invest in our existing businesses; second, is to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy; these are almost always our first two choices. Our third is to give the extra back to the shareholders through either special dividends or stock buybacks; and fourth, is to pay off debt. And as I've said before, given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions.","As we've done consistently in the past, based on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner we think as the best chance to maximize our returns.","To update you on a few items. The credit markets has been erratic over the last few months. However our bonds have not traded down significantly and we believe we still have adequate access to the debt market at reasonable cost. Terry will give a little more detail on the rates.","As we mentioned in previous calls, the rates we pay on our current debt are significantly hedged or collard for about the next four years.","Through January, we have bought back about a $100 million of TransDigm stock at roughly $218 a share. About $70 million of this occurred in Q1 and the balance during January. We currently have an additional $450 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything about our current plans for capital allocation.","We closed the Breeze acquisition in early January that is the start of our second quarter for about $178 million net of $27 million of acquired cash. The 9\/30\/2015 LPM EBITDA was publicly disclosed by the seller at about $23 million and revenue of about $98 million. The seller's 2016 forecast was also a public number at about $19 million of EBITDA and $98 million of revenue. There were certain one-time items in 2015 that positively impacted EBITDA.","Breeze is a good, proprietary, mostly sole-sourced business with about 70% aftermarket. It's a good business to TransDigm. Total margins may not get all the way to our overall average; we see significant opportunities for margin expansion. As usual, we see solid PE type returns on our equity in this field.","At January 2, 2016, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe, we have adequate capacity to make about $1.50 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated levels for fiscal year '16.","The commercial transport aftermarket continues weaker than the traffic growth would suggest. So not clear, this still seems at least for our company's products to be driven primarily by some mix of inventory management, by airlines, and deferrals of spending. If you look over the last five to six years, this does not appear dissimilar to prior market variations.","We also looked carefully at the impact of the surplus market on our sales. We are advised that parts above the $5,000 to $10,000 unit price are the most likely candidates. We looked at our last three years of sales. Commercial aftermarket part sales with a unit price over $5,000 only make up about 4% to 5% of our total revenues, and about 10% of our commercial aftermarket. In total, this group of parts with a unit price over $5,000 has grown nicely over the last few years. A few parts are down, but it is a very small dollar value and other parts are up significantly. Our balance at this time, we can see little, if any, quantifiable impact from surplus parts over the last few years on our parts.","We see a number of factors that could contribute to stronger aftermarket growth in 2016. Plus, such as the continuing strong passenger traffic, a slowdown in retirements, potential end of deferral inventory cycle. But obviously these have not yet resulted in much of a bump.","Turning now to our Q1 of our fiscal year '16 performance. I'll remind you; this is the first quarter for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2015. Also as a reminder, Q1 has about 10% less shipping days than the other three quarters.","As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons could be significantly impacted by differences in the OEM aftermarket mix, order timing, inventory fluctuations, modest seasonality, and the like.","Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA were strong. Both were up in the range of 20% versus the prior Q1. The organic revenue was slightly down on a quarter versus prior year quarter. Q1 revenues in total were on our expectations. That is, excluding Breeze, there are about 10% less than the average anticipated fiscal year '16 quarterly shipments that is roughly in line with the reduced shipping days. The EBITDA As Defined was also on our expectation.","Reviewing the revenues by market category, again, this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q1; that is, assuming we owned the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up about 1% versus the prior Q1. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up about 85% of our commercial OEM revenues, were up 5% versus the prior Q1. The commercial transport growth primarily reflects the market conditions and is in line with our expectations.","On the other hand bizjet and helicopter OEM revenues which make up around 15% of our commercial OEM revenues, most of which is business jet. In total revenues in these markets were down versus the prior Q1 about 11%. This significant drop pulled the total commercial average down. It appears this is mostly timing as one, the business jet bookings ran well ahead of shipments; and two, our largest bizjet customs Gulfstream and Textron, seemed to still be expecting decent years in 2016. For the quarter, total commercial OEM bookings were modestly above shipments.","The total commercial aftermarket revenues were about flat for this quarter versus the prior year Q1. Commercial transport aftermarket revenues which also make up about 85% of our commercial aftermarket revenues were up around 2%. This was offset by bizjet, helicopter, and the GA market -- aftermarket revenues, which were down almost 15%. For the quarter, commercial aftermarket bookings in total were modestly above shipments, with the commercial transport segment bookings up, and the bizjet and helicopter markets down.","In the defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q1 were down 1% versus the prior year Q1. One large international shipment was delayed by a customer about a week at year-end. Without that delay revenues would have been up 2% versus the prior Q1. The revenues and other products were spotty with no clear pattern. Q1 defense bookings also ran modestly ahead of shipments.","Now, moving on to profitability. Again, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q1 were non-cash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. Our EBITDA As Defined of about $319 million for Q1 was up 18% versus the prior Q1. The EBITDA As Defined margin was about 46% of revenues for Q1, about the same as last year's Q1 in spite of approximately 1.50% of margin dilution from the 2015 acquisitions.","As we mentioned in the last quarter, we reduced our employment level about 4% to 5% over the 120 days prior to this quarter end. This, combined with our other value drivers, contributed to the strong margins.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities looks a little light, this can change quickly. Closings are difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Moving on now to 2016, we continue to have some concerns about duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I said before, we're being cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary.","In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well. And as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact to demand. However, in general, publicly reported commercial transport aftermarket revenue trends have been mixed and we still see reports of potential economic softening. On balance, these factors tend to keep us cautious.","But all in all this is our best current estimate for the year. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond Breeze, in fiscal year 2016, our revised guidance is as follows: the midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance is $3.2 billion, an increase of $70 million from our prior guidance. This is up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year; organic growth is still anticipated to be in the range of 5% year-over-year. The revenue increase in our guidance is due primarily to the Breeze acquisition.","The midpoint of fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.44 billion an increase of $20 million. This is up 16% year-over-year. The increase in the EBITDA guidance is mostly driven the Breeze acquisition with some modest upward adjustment in our base margin.","The base business, excluding the 2015 acquisitions, and Breeze, is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up roughly two points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses.","The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $10.77 a share or up about $0.32 a share from our last guidance. This is a 20% increase from the prior year. The increase in guidance is due about half to the Breeze acquisition and the balance through a combination of improved margin, lower tax rate, and slightly lower share count. Terry will review these details a little more.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions; commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-to-high-single-digit percent based on worldwide RPM growth of around 5%. We are still cautious due to the factors I discussed earlier and frankly due to a somewhat softer Q1.","Defense and military revenue growth is still forecasted in the low-single-digits. Given world events, there could well be variations here.","Commercial OEM revenue growth; we're guiding in the mid-single-digit percentage range primarily due to the 2016 and 2017 commercial transport production rates. We're still assuming commercial transport unit airframe shipments are up in the low-single-digit percent for 2016. We are cautious about 2017 production rates and how this could reflect in our 2016 shipments.","At this time, we are assuming that the sharp drop in Q1 business jet shipments is mostly timing. Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.2 billion in cash and over $500 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016. We also had additional capacity under our credit agreement.","Again assuming no additional acquisitions or other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9 times to EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down roughly one turn.","In summary, Q1 was decent start to the year, we met our expectations. As I look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are somewhat unclear and that makes us cautious. However we may have some margin upside to help offset some market variations.","In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value focused strategy and strong mix of business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors.","With that, let me hand this over to Terry.","Terry Paradie","Thank you, Nick. I will now review our Q1 financial results. First quarter net sales were $702 million, up $115 million or approximately 20% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions; Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics, and Franke, was an increase of $121 million offset by a slight decline in organic sales.","Our first quarter gross profit was $375 million, an increase of 17%. Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was 1.3 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related cost which accounted for a decrease of over two margin points.","Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved over 1 margin point due to the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure, despite slight decline in organic sales.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.5% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.6% of sales a year ago.","We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $13 million versus the prior year quarter. This was the result of an increase to the outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was partially to fund the acquisitions in the fiscal 2015.","Our effective tax rate was 30% in the current quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior year. The low effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings, taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rates, and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our expected full-year estimated tax rate has decreased slightly to below 31% due to the R&D tax credit. We believe, we have an opportunity to increase the benefit of the R&D credit in the future and we have just began a study to explore this opportunity. We will update the progress with you next quarter. We still expect our cash taxes to be above $200 million for fiscal year 2016.","Our net income for the quarter increased $19 million or 20% to $115 million, which is 16.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $96 million or 16% of net sales in the prior year. The increases in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense, non-cash compensation, and acquisition-related costs versus the prior period.","GAAP EPS was $1.97 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.63 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.27 per share, an increase of 26% compared to the $1.80 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Now switching gears to cash and liquidity, we ended the quarter with $805 million of cash on the balance sheet after spending $71 million to purchase 324,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, we continue to repurchase shares in January, we spend another $28 million to purchase 128,000 shares. So in total we purchased 452,000 shares at a total cost of $99 million. We now expect the full-year weighted average shares to be 56.5 million shares.","The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.7 times of pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and gross leverage was 6.3 times pro forma EBITDA. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016, will be 4.9 times assuming no acquisitions or capital market transaction.","As for access to the capital markets, we believe the high yield market will be very receptive to our high quality paper, despite the current high yield market conditions. We believe the coupon rate on a new offering could be 50 basis points higher from where our bonds are trading today depending on the tender of the issuance.","With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $9.60. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $10.77. The $1.17 of adjustments to bridge the GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend equivalent payments, $0.56 from non-cash stock option expense, and $0.56 of acquisition-related expenses, up $0.13 primarily related to Breeze.","Now, I will hand it back to Liza to kick-off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol","Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions].","And please standby for your first question, which comes from the line of Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.","Noah Poponak","Terry, do you happen to have that same EPS bridge from the old guidance to the new guidance?","Terry Paradie","Yes, I believe it's in the conference materials versus the presentation materials on --","Noah Poponak","Okay. Excuse me for that then.","Terry Paradie","-- on Page 7 is like sort of a comparison that should help you to do the reconciliation.","Noah Poponak","Okay. In terms of the acquired revenue in the quarter the $121 million that you disclosed, does that have the same --?","Terry Paradie","I'm sorry, Noah. I'm sorry. The page was Page 9 is the reconciliation. Page 9, you see there.","Noah Poponak","Yes. Got it. Perfect.","Terry Paradie","Okay.","Noah Poponak","The acquired revenue in the quarter, does it have the same seasonality as the legacy business kind of as soon as it's brought in? And was it -- what do you expected it to be in the quarter?","Nick Howley","Are you talking about the Breeze business, Noah?","Noah Poponak","No. I'm talking about the combination of the four prior to Breeze that you disclosed as being $121 million in the quarter?","Nick Howley","Oh, you mean do they have the same sort of seasonality pattern of less shipping days?","Noah Poponak","Yes.","Nick Howley","Is that your question?","Noah Poponak","Yes.","Nick Howley","Noah, the answer is I believe yes, though I frankly haven't looked at the exact number. But I mean they have the same issue. There is less shipping days. They essentially don't ship anything around Christmas week all that sort of thing.","Noah Poponak","Okay. I just asked, it just looked a little late of what we had and consensus revenue -- or revenue in the quarter was light of consensus and I just wonder if myself when potentially others were just modeling the seasonality of that incorrectly?","Nick Howley","The way we look at this, is I think I try to say if we strip out an acquisition which is only Breeze in this case, the first quarter runs about 10% less shipping days than the average quarter through the year and we see that most years.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And then, were you mentioned having better margins in the legacy business, which I guess changed in the outlook. Can you talk about where that's coming from?","Nick Howley","Well I think it is -- you mean what business or what segment? I mean it's --","Noah Poponak","I guess, I mean how much of it --","Nick Howley","-- the primary driver I would say is the normal, our pricing works as usual, but I don't think it was anything extraordinary. But we're squeezing cost out. I think we simply took about 4% to 5% out of the headcount which is the biggest, one of the biggest controllable cost and the volume was not down 4% to 5%.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland at Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Just to dig into the headcount again. The comment you made on the SG&A leverage on an adjusted basis the 9.9% versus 10.6%, was that presumably all related to the headcount or how should we think about the headcount reduction in terms of cost of sales versus SG&A?","Terry Paradie","Now, the cost of network frankly the 4% to 5% is really primarily driven from the sites as probably cost of sales. There will be some overhead cost in SG&A, but the bulk of that piece would be in the cost side and in the gross margin line item.","Carter Copeland","Okay. So it was actually a decent amount of better SG&A performance on an apples-to-apples basis as well?","Nick Howley","I guess what I -- oh, excuse me. Go ahead.","Terry Paradie","Yes. I would say yes, absolutely we had better SG&A performance on an apples-to-apples basis as well.","Carter Copeland","And on the shipping days comment with respect to -- I mean I can appreciate the fact that there is fewer shipping days in every single Q1. But when you look at the year-over-year comparison was there a difference in shipping days this Q1 versus the prior year's Q1 because of the timing of holidays and did that have an impact?","Terry Paradie","The real answer to that Carter is I don't know the answer. That makes sensible answer, Nick.","Nick Howley","The pattern is roughly the same every year. I frankly didn't go back and see when the last -- it's when the last, kind of holiday around New Year's falls and I don't -- I just don't remember.","Carter Copeland","They just seem like flat or organic down 1%, was a little bit less than probably what you would have expected?","Nick Howley","Yes, they are. As I said Carter, our revenues for the quarter were just about what we expected them to be.","Operator","Thanks. The next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna at Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the decisions you re-up the buyback authorization in the context of your other comments around the M&A pipeline being a little softer. Should we expect to see buybacks take a higher priority over M&A in the short-term?","Terry Paradie","I -- we'll own any capital and capital allocation. We'll do what makes sense at the time we address it. As I said, I would not take the increase of $450 million to mean anything regarding our intention. Other than I think $450 million is roughly what's still available in our credit agreement.","Nick Howley","Is that correct? Isn't that close rough ballpark to our?","Terry Paradie","Yes. So -- and we wanted to have maximum flexibility. So we moved the authorization up to roughly about where the -- that limit was. You saw we bought a $100 million bucks back. But I can't say that we're making a specific decision to change our capital allocation. Obviously, if the stock bounces all around and drops -- continually drops, we'll view it as a better opportunity.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And could you maybe elaborate on what you are seeing in the M&A pipeline? What do you think explains the pause and --?","Nick Howley","I don't -- the answer is what explains the pause I don't know. But I can say we just don't seem to see as much activity. Now, this moves around. If you remember in '14, we bought very modest amount of businesses. In '15 over 12-month period we bought -- put out close to $2 billion. It -- and it seems little light right now. But I could tell you just from my past experience, and our past experience in TransDigm is you've seen in the public market, we saw before in the private market. We could end up in 30 days or 90 days with a whole Russia stock. But if I had illicit today, it's little lighter than I would've hoped.","Gautam Khanna","And Nick, could you may be remind us including Breeze-Eastern kind of how -- what's the lag is in terms of your -- the value based pricing initiatives on acquired business? I know it differs by each one of them, but what is the lag there?","Nick Howley","Yes. It -- that's hard to say. It really does depend on the businesses. We model businesses when we buy them and we hope to model them conservatively. We model the improvements over a four to five-year period. And I think as I have said before, we assume we're going to buy them, hold them for four or five years and sell them. And we have to see a return on our equity up above 20%, usually well above. And we generally do better than that. And also frankly, we never sell them. So I would say the mix in pricing is very dependent on where company stands in its LPA cycles, what if any commitments they have in the aftermarket, it's hard to give a general number.","Gautam Khanna","I guess sort of because the aftermarket came in a little bit light relative to the full-year guide anyway. Is that -- is the value based pricing on the recently acquired deal the big part of why you think you'll still be able to achieve the up -- mid-to-high-single-digit in the aftermarket or you anticipating something else as an improvement in the underlying market?","Nick Howley","We're hoping for an improvement in the underlying market.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Nick Howley","I see nothing in the pricing dynamics that concerns me.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Myles Walton at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Lou Taylor","Good morning. This is actually Lou Taylor on for Myles.","Nick Howley","That's your alias.","Lou Taylor","So last quarter you guys -- and just sort of back on the aftermarket now that you were optimistic on aftermarket, little bit of rest on the OE, is that sort of the same as you're feeling now? I know you're cautious overall. But I mean are you still sort of more cautious on the OE side after the first quarter?","Nick Howley","I'd say we're at the same place on the OE side. The bizjet frankly was -- the bizjet revenue was -- that was little softer than we expected. But we -- from what our bookings looks like and what our -- what customers tell us we're -- we think that's a timing issue. It's also relatively small part of the business. I think when the commercial transport, we've been cautious and we remain somewhat cautious and that's probably best reflected and the fact we started take the cost down.","Lou Taylor","All right and just based on what you said just to round out the revenue questions I guess you said they're roughly in line obviously you talked about the slippage of one contract in military and then obviously the bizjet being wide, I mean that obviously would make up for some of the lightness may be not the full amount versus what the industry was expecting but I think those two together they help to buy some of that?","Nick Howley","Yes they do, I also they also close the gap some. The military one was just the couple of days issue but that's not a big deal but it moves it -- moves military. I think probably the most significant difference is we typically look at the first quarter is having less shipping days and you're going to ship 10% less than the run rate or something like that I'm not sure that was reflected and the numbers are floating around.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn at Credit Suisse. Go ahead please.","Robert Spingarn","So, Nick, going back to I guess Gautam was getting at this. But can you may be comment that aftermarket is really not a whole lot different than it's been over the last five to six years. Having said that though your organic growth was quite a bit higher going back to couple of years ago than it is now. So either it's not tied to aftermarket or maybe it's tied to either the timing or the magnitude of the price increases on the acquired businesses?","Nick Howley","I'm not sure that's what I said. So let me try and mean what I meant to be saying, maybe I didn't make it clear. If we can go back and trace take something like RPM and track that over say five or six years and then take our aftermarket sales and whatever index you want to use for the other people in the business and track them, you'll see a lot of variation around that, you will see some way higher, way lower run rate along. If I look at a graph it doesn't look that unusual to me now that's what I'm saying. I noticed, rough, you had a chart that tracked it that you put out this morning for a couple of years, I mean we look at this over the last five years and track ourselves against rest of the industry and there is a fair amount -- it doesn't look that different than other cyclical variations have looked.","Robert Spingarn","Well, but our -- and look our numbers could be wrong but it's lower than it used to be and I\u2019m wondering if this is one different aftermarket behavior which would contradict a little bit that five to six year comment or is it simply that your acquisitions as a percentage of the total business are smaller today than they used to be. And therefore that pricing dynamic has a smaller effect on the organic?","Nick Howley","I don't think that's the answer Rob but I honestly can't give you a direct answer to that. I don't I would tell you just to be clear. I've seen no change in the pricing dynamics. I\u2019ve seen no change in the pricing dynamics of the business we buy. Now I guess your point is, if you buy $300 million business it's nowhere near the percent of our total as it was in the past but that's just true.","Robert Spingarn","Yes and I'm wondering if that's ultimately the factor and people should calibrate around that?","Nick Howley","I don't -- my own, I happen to be looking at a chart that anybody could make up. My own guess is we'll see a cycle back.","Robert Spingarn","Okay.","Nick Howley","I have to admit Rob; I'm a little surprised as we move faster.","Robert Spingarn","Okay, fair enough. I had another question just on the bizjet you mentioned the OE was a little bit soft and it might be timing related. Is there anything seasonal about that period of time historically with the bizjet OE?","Nick Howley","Not this seems disproportionate Rob, but it's down substantively versus the prior Q1.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And reason I asked is we're getting a lot of mixed commentary from the manufacturers in bizjet and what is going on, some stronger than others?","Nick Howley","Yes, and we take some comfort there and the bookings were pretty strong in the bizjet. And the two big customers, the two biggest we sell all the biggest are Gulfstream and Textron and they seem to still be expecting a decent year though we do seem to have a lot of sort of moving around the deliveries and that sort of thing.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Last question on FX or those who are domiciles and weak currencies, have you seen any change in behavior on the aftermarket side from airlines that might be struggling with currency more than others that aren't?","Nick Howley","That I don\u2019t know that I can pin to that specifically Rob, but I mean that could make sense to me. There's awful lot of we sell everything in dollars, the majority of our aftermarket customers are believing in some other currency and things were very expensive to them. Now I can\u2019t give you any specifics on that but that's sort of make sense to me. Now that can\u2019t go on very long right, the consumption the same at some point you're going to buy.","Robert Spingarn","Right, right or fly less.","Nick Howley","Yes, or fly less, that's right, that's right. But anecdotally that could make sense but I have to tell you I can't -- I can't put any numbers around that. Now one of the things we did put some effort into as I mentioned we're putting numbers around was the surplus parts. And we have a very hard time seeing; we don't see anything in there when we track the high dollar value parts.","Operator","Thanks. The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","On the headcount reduction, were there cost associated with that in the quarter and if so were they in the acquisition-related adjustments?","Terry Paradie","No, the costs would be pretty; pretty tied to be honest but you know be included in whatever line item will be in cost of sales and\/or SG&A.","Seth Seifman","Okay. So they were very small but they are in the adjusted, they are in the EBITDA as defined?","Nick Howley","They are in the numbers.","Terry Paradie","They would be in the regulatory, yes.","Nick Howley","They are in the numbers.","Seth Seifman","Okay, great. And then just I'm curious a little bit about the share repurchases your decision to buy back stock, it sounds like you become a little bit more cautious on the OE side, I feel like you sound a little bit more cautious about aftermarket than you did last quarter and the decision to ramp up the repurchases in the context of those end market sentiments?","Nick Howley","I'm not exactly sure how to answer that. I mean, we obviously we bought shares because we thought the price looks good is why we bought them. Now, may be the reason for that is because the market assumptions that the market -- the market is making but what we bought we just look at this as a capital allocation when the buy looks good and we don\u2019t immediately see any near-term uses, no matter, we buy.","Operator","Thanks. The next question is from the line of Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. So trying to touch on a couple other questions, one that may be Rob was asking was the FX question but Nick I'm kind of curious if you\u2019re seeing any changes in behavior with how some of your U.S. customers and customers in markets as currency have really gotten ahead in particularly emerging market customers. As it relates specifically to some of the really, really discretionary stuff, have you seen any major sort of disparate changes in how you deliver?","Nick Howley","I don\u2019t think we have -- I don\u2019t think we have. No, no, I don\u2019t I know we haven\u2019t. We have a few businesses that are tied to more discretionary things like inferior upgrades and things like that and frankly they are doing okay.","Hunter Keay","Yes.","Nick Howley","So I can't -- no, I like to be able to put my finger on something like that and say there it is but I can\u2019t.","Hunter Keay","And can you may be help us think about Nick I don\u2019t know if you put this out there, I'm sorry if I missed it but how much your aftermarket exposure in actually U.S. based and how much is not?","Nick Howley","It\u2019s roughly; it\u2019s roughly the same as the installed base of airplanes. I mean, we're pretty well market weighted so take RPMs, take installed base of airplanes, I\u2019m saying this from memory but I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s something around 30%.","Hunter Keay","Okay. That\u2019s helpful and then --","Nick Howley","And if that\u2019s not exactly the right number it doesn\u2019t mean that our business is disproportionately weighted it means I forgot the right number.","Hunter Keay","Sure, yes, of course absolutely. Thanks for taking a stab and then we saw, Nick, we saw change in your compensation structure, I\u2019m assuming this is unrelated to next part of this question but can you talk about any updated thoughts around succession planning at the company. Thanks for the time.","Nick Howley","I think no different than we've said before, no different than we've said before. I have a contract and you know what the contract -- what my contract says. With the change in the compensation up, frankly, I -- probably 95% of my compensation for the last 10 years has been equity driven anyway. And I -- I'm going to make it all equity driven, which I think is generally a vote of confidence.","Hunter Keay","Okay.","Nick Howley","Now, after I do that by the way, the stock is supposed to go up, not down by the way. That's a joke guys.","Hunter Keay","I was on mute. I enjoyed it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Strauss at UBS. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Nick, your cautiousness on commercial OE, I mean is it anything specific beyond just emerging markets looks week, airlines just scrapping fewer airplanes. I mean is there anything else that you're looking at and seeing and saying that this just doesn't feel right relative to the OE rates that are out there?","Nick Howley","David, I don't have any unique insight any more than any of you guys do. As I said before, it feels long it took to me. I noticed some rates were starting to move down in the wider bodies. I noticed airline monitored and I'm sure you follow them. I noticed they soften their sort of soften their outlook here and the last time they published it, it concerns us.","I don't -- again, I have no unique knowledge, nor do I have any certainty about it. But our view is and you're better off to get cost out quick and you can always adjust the other direction that you have to.","David Strauss","Right. And talk about how much more you can do from a cost cutting side, if you end up being right and OE rates end up moving lower rather than higher over the next couple of years?","Nick Howley","Yes. I think -- to say so much potentially, I think we do whatever we have to do to try and hold the margins. But I think it drops in the 10%, 15%, 20% kind of range particularly, with the fact that the aftermarket typically doesn't drop like that at all and you get a little mix. I think we can pretty comfortably between cost reductions and the balance for our business hold the margins, hold the margin percent.","David Strauss","Right. I got it. Okay. Last one for me. Terry, on the free cash or on the cash balance that you're implying for year-end at $1.2 billion, did that imply something around $700 million to $750 million in free cash flow? And obviously, adjusted earnings are going up, cash taxes are also in a fair amount. Can you just help us what the big working capital moving pieces are to get you to that kind of level on free cash flow?","Terry Paradie","Yes. I think our working capital has stayed fairly consistent. What we try to do is, we look at receivables, inventory, net of payables, and we try to keep that in the 26% to 30% of pro forma sales on a regular basis. And that's where we're at today and that's the plan to continue going forward. I think where you're going to see from, to get us to the $1.2 billion is very consistent what we said last quarter. We said we will just under $1.5 billion for the year and think about the buybacks that we've done and the acquisition of Breeze, I think you can reconcile down to the $1.2 billion. So we really haven't changed anything from where we were last quarter, from our outlook of cash at the end of the year.","Operator","Thanks. The next question is from the line of Robert Stallard at Royal Bank of Canada. Go ahead please.","Robert Stallard","Nick, I'll just follow-up on David's question? You've got this hunch about OEM aerospace that's up cycle there may be not lasting forever. But you stand pretty confident about the aftermarket. I thought if you could give us some more clarity on why you think this expected [indiscernible] spare part purchasing is going to improve pretty radically over the next nine months? And also what your assumptions might be for the smaller bizjet and helicopter off the market?","Nick Howley","Yes. The -- on the commercial transport aftermarket, it's just -- if I look at previous cycles around the -- around flight hours this seems to me to be down a while, it seems to me typically these have started to come back and caught up. I don't know of any change in the underlying user consumption of the parts. So at some point it's got to pick up. Now, do I call the term exactly right? I don't know. That's our best judgment as we sit here today. As I said, if we're off a little we think we have some -- may have some margin room, well, if you look at down at EBITDA or EPS. But I mean I don't have any crystal ball to call the term exactly.","And what was your other question about the bizjet?","Robert Stallard","Yes. I mean what your assumptions are for the aftermarket in the bizjet and helicopter, because I think they were a bit of a drag in Q1?","Nick Howley","Yes, they were down pretty significantly. Our assumptions are roughly they don't stay like that. They pick up a little bit through the year. We -- it seems to us to be an overreaction. Now, I don't -- the helicopter business, the commercial helicopter business is pretty bumpy as I'm sure you know in aftermarket and OEM, but that's not a lot of our business. So I don't see that driving it much. But I would expect the aftermarket for the business jets to be a little better. Though I have to say the aftermarket business jet bookings weren't great in the quarter, that's in the aftermarket. The OEM bookings were quite good.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli at KeyBanc Capital. Go ahead please.","Michael Ciarmoli","Just on the whole aftermarket trend here, last quarter I think you kind of characterized it we're guiding to mid-to high-single-digit may be hopeful for some upside. Now, you kind of maintain that forecast. Did you know there is may be more of a bias towards from downside there? I mean can you kind of give us a sense of what you're seeing quarter-to-date, I mean just how do we get comfortable? And without having that visibility into what you were just talking about kind of deferral unwinding there, how do we see this acceleration in the remaining quarters here to get --","Nick Howley","I mean I've seen a pickup in demand. Michael, as you know, I'm not -- if you take the numbers this quarter and take the numbers for the year and divide by three you got to see a pickup in demand. Historically, that's happened there for a period like this. You've ended up with some pretty high quarters. If the pickup doesn't happen then we won't meet the number. Now, that doesn't mean we won't meet our revenue or EPS number some other way. But --","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it.","Nick Howley","But that segment we wouldn't meet it.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. And then you're appropriately conservative and cautious I guess on commercial transport OE, but you don't sound that cautious on business jet OE. And I'm wondering it seems like there is more reasons for concern there given what we're seeing in emerging economies. And I know what we've heard from Gulfstream and Textron. But it seems like there is more risk at that production definitively, I mean are you guys hedging bizjet OE in a similar manner to a commercial transport?","Nick Howley","Well, your assumption going into the year wasn't much growth there. Now, it wasn't a drop like we saw in the first quarter. So we're trending the same place as we were going into the year that that's sort of a flattish market.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay.","Nick Howley","So -- and it's not running at a real high level. Every year everybody thinks it's going to pick up, but it hasn't. Now, the underlying takeoff and landings aren't great, but they're not drastically down.","Michael Ciarmoli","Yes. Okay. And then just last one for me. The revenue change, was that entirely Breeze, was there any other moving part there I mean 777 rate being cut?","Nick Howley","Almost entirely Breeze, almost entirely. Anything else was puts and takes.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it.","Nick Howley","If some unit went up, some else was down to offset it. It's almost dollar for dollar Breeze.","Operator","Thank you. And you now have another question from a line of Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.","Noah Poponak","Terry, on issuing debt where you mentioned you think you would be 50 basis points higher tomorrow than where your active wheels are. You have a number of products and they all have different coupons and have the different changes in yield and there is new issue discount and I don't know if you're including that or not. Could you maybe also frame that as one of the products you issued in the last year you got of coupon of X and if you issued of the same or a very similar product tomorrow you'd have a coupon of Y?","Terry Paradie","Yes, Noah. I can cover that. So the last product -- the last thing we did was last, I think it was April or May of 2015. I think the coupon on that was about 6.5%. Just kind of again stepping back from standpoint of the market, the high yield market there is a lot of volatility in there and it is primarily in the oil and gas area. There is a lot of demand for quality paper that we have. We talk to our banks on several occasions and we stay close to them and there will be a lot of interest in us issuing more paper if we had to. We don\u2019t see the need at this point in time. But ultimately, if we were to go to market today in today\u2019s conditions, we will probably looking at something in 7.25%, 7.50% range as a coupon rate for --","Nick Howley","That is for step up the leverage, steps up the leverage not to replace it.","Terry Paradie","Right, just to step up the leverage for new issuance of bonds on secured bonds at this point in time.","Noah Poponak","Great, that is very helpful. On the business jet discussion, Nick, you\u2019re saying bookings were ahead of shipments, can you maybe go a little more specific on where that was because that is surprising unless I guess possibly just a function of the denominator there being there?","Nick Howley","Well I think the group of shipments are so low, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Nick Howley","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s not that the bookings are so off but shipments are disproportionately, down that is the point I was trying to make.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And then Breeze, Breeze has a pretty healthy mix of military. Are you actively looking to acquire more in military just given where we are in the respective cycles?","Nick Howley","No, we\u2019re not and we\u2019re not avoiding it, it\u2019s just we have the sort of the same sort all the time proprietary aerospace significant aftermarket comping. What we pay is dependent on what we think of the outlook of it but we are neither avoiding nor are we seeking military disproportionately.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Kevin Stein","We\u2019re just going to look at the platforms, look at our forecast, look at our view of it and price it accordingly.","Noah Poponak","Okay, it makes sense. Final one, Terry, the R&D tax credit potential further incremental step you mentioned anything you can say on rough order of magnitude and timing related to that?","Terri Paradie","No, we\u2019re too early into the study period right now, I think there is some opportunity but we ought to do our due diligence, we're decentralized, we have 31, 32 business units. We\u2019re going to have to go, do our homework there and see what qualifies and once we have that data and we\u2019ll come up and change our effective tax rate for you guys.","Operator","Thank you. We now have our next question from Gautam Khanna. Go ahead please.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks again. I just wondered could you give us any color on how the aftermarket expanded since December 31.","Nick Howley","You say since reception at the end of the quarter?","Gautam Khanna","Yes.","Nick Howley","I don\u2019t \u2013 we just I don\u2019t want to comment on sort of short term times like that. I think we\u2019ll wait for the quarter and talk about it when we have the data. I don\u2019t want to start anecdotally comment it.","Gautam Khanna","I just wonder do you think any part of the softness could have been year-end inventory management and many of your MRO and airline customers as opposed to.","Nick Howley","It surely could be, it surely could be but I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to hang in on anything specific unless I have the data pretty clearly. But it\u2019s not unusual that we see inventory adjustments at the end of the year people want to kind of polish things up.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And in terms of how your catalog pricing changes, is the changed price kind of ratably throughout the year or is there a big price hike that is coming to effect?","Nick Howley","It\u2019s all over the map; it is all over the map for the businesses. Some have a catalog they put out once a year but it\u2019s not necessarily on a calendar cycle, some don\u2019t have a catalog, they price a lot of it on demand, so there is not a one point of time we would certainly step up.","Gautam Khanna","Since January was not significant base from\u2026","Nick Howley","I don\u2019t think so. I mean we may answer is I think it\u2019s pretty ratable through the year maybe a little weighted towards the prices going in the first half of the year but then have to work through the backlog a little bit.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And just one last one, are you seeing any differences between the products we sell through distribution that's out there in Aviole [ph] versus the direct sales?","Nick Howley","No.","Gautam Khanna","Is that different aftermarket trend?","Nick Howley","No.","Operator","Thank you very much. As there are no further questions for you now gentlemen, so I would now like to turn the call back to Liza Sabol for closing remarks.","Liza Sabol","Thank you all for participating on this morning\u2019s call and please look for 10-Q that we expect to file tomorrow.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liza Sabol from \u2013 Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, James Skulina.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks, and replay information will be contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com. It should also be noted that our Form 10-Q will be filed tomorrow and will also be found on our website.","Before we begin, we would like to remind you that the statements made during this call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC, available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","We would also like to advise you that, during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release or a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and the reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks again for calling in. As usual, I'll start off with a quick review of our consistent strategy. I'll then summarize the first quarter of 2018. Kevin will review the key operational and market issues for the quarter. And Jim will then run through the financials and also discuss the near-term impact of the new tax law.","As you may have seen, Terry Paradie, our former CFO resigned for personal reasons in early January. Jim Skulina, who is on the call today, has agreed to fill the job until we find and are comfortable with the new CFO either internally or externally. Jim is with TransDigm for 23 years and has extensive experience at the senior level, both as an operating and as a financial executive for the company.","For the last six years, Jim has been an Executive Vice President Group Officer responsible for a number of our larger operating units and acquisitions. In addition to other responsibilities, Jim has also been the Corporate Controller and Operating Unit President through his career with TransDigm among other jobs. We are lucky to have Jim willing and available to take this job on.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry both in its consistency and its ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, over 3\/4 of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider, over half of our revenues and much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced higher gross margins and relative stability through the cycles in the downturns.","Our longstanding goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation, as well as the careful management of our balance sheet. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content.","Second, we employ a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology based upon our three value driver concepts. Third, we maintain a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit with our focused strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for allocation of capital. To remind you, we basically have four, and our priorities are almost always as follows: first, to invest in our existing business; second, to make accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy and our tough return requirements; third is to get the money back to the shareholders, either through a special dividend or stock buybacks; and fourth would be to pay down debt. Though, still, given the low cost of debt especially after tax, this remains likely our last choice in the current capital markets.","In the last three years, you've seen different business conditions and examples of how we deal with them. In 2015 and 2016, we saw a number of attractive acquisitions, and we bought about $3 billion of proprietary aerospace businesses. In 2017, attractive candidates were fewer and far between. Accordingly, we chose to allocate about $3 billion of our capital to return to the shareholders. We did this through a mix of primarily special dividends, but also some opportunistic stock buybacks. We'll see what the full year of fiscal 2018 brings. But as we've done consistently in the past, we'll allocate our capital in the manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders.","Now, to quickly summarize Q1 of fiscal year 2018. Our Q1 operations that is revenue and EBITDA as adjusted were right about on our expectations. They were roughly 23% and 22%, respectively, of our full year guidance, about the same percent as they have been in prior years. To remind you, there are about 10% less shipping days in Q1 versus the average of the other three quarters. Our Q1 earnings per share both GAAP and as adjusted are both up very substantially. This is primarily the result of the new tax law. Jim will review this in more detail. As I'm sure you are aware, many of the implementing rules and regulations have still not been finalized. So, we will be reticent to get too specific at this time, especially beyond fiscal year 2018. We do expect to generate roughly $70 million of additional cash in fiscal year 2018 as a result of the new tax law changes.","Now, on a same-store basis versus prior Q1, in the commercial transport aftermarket which makes up the vast majority of our commercial aftermarket, Q1 versus the prior year was up just about 11%. Business jet and helicopter revenue growth was softer, and this pulled the overall average for commercial aftermarket down to about 10%.","Commercial OEM revenues were roughly flat versus the prior year. Defense revenues were also about flat. However, incoming defense bookings were substantially up versus the prior year. Kevin will expand on all this. Although one quarter doesn't make a trend, we feel good about the start of the year especially in the commercial aftermarket. We completed the sale of Schroth at the end of January for about $60 million in cash to Perusa Partners, a midsized PE firm located in Germany. This is not a great outcome. But given the overall situation, we believe it was the most prudent and practical approach to get this behind us and to move on.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline is active. We've been looking at a lot of opportunities recently. Closings are difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on the value opportunities that can meet our tight PE-like return requirements. Without any additional acquisition or capital structure activity, we now expect to generate closer to $1 billion in cash from operations after considering the cash impact of the new tax law. As we said in the last earnings call, as long as our outlook continues to be comfortably in the range, we don't intend to adjust our guidance quarterly.","Since it seems too soon in the year to draw any conclusions, we're leaving our revenue and EBITDA as adjusted full year guidance unchanged. If the business situation looks similar at the end of Q2, I expect we may well adjust our full year guidance at that time.","The increase to the net income and the EPS guidance are due to the new tax law's estimated impact. The savings and interest expense from our recent refinancing, we are estimating to be roughly offset by a modest increase in the LIBOR rate. In another words, the actual rates we pay so far are holding about flat. Jim will give a little more color on this.","In summary, Q1 was a good start for the year. So, far fiscal year 2018 looks positive. But in any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and our strong mix of business we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our shareholders.","And with that, let me hand it over to Kevin.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. As you've seen, Q1 of fiscal year 2018 was an encouraging start to our fiscal year. Now, to review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year of 2017. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket as usual. In our commercial OEM market, Q1 fiscal year 2018 revenues were about flat when compared to the Q1 of fiscal year 2017.","Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up most of our commercial OEM business, were down slightly when compared to the prior-year period. We continue to believe inventory management by our OEM customers, much of which appears due to rate reductions on wide-body platforms or simply slower ramp-ups on new wide-body platforms, have created headwinds in the commercial OEM market. As was the case in 2017, commercial transport OEM sales can be up and down quarter-to-quarter. But, at the core, no significant changes in chipset content have occurred. So, any softness is simply timing related.","Business jet and helicopter OEM revenues make up about 15% of our commercial OEM revenues. Revenues in this market were up high-single digits in Q1 when compared to the year-ago period. Q1 bookings were up even more, positive for sure, but too soon to tell if sustainable, but not dissimilar to what others in the industry are reporting.","Now, moving on to our commercial aftermarket business; total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by about 10% in the quarter. Commercial transport aftermarket, which makes up about 85% of our total commercial aftermarket, revenues in Q1 fiscal year 2018 were up almost 11% over the prior-year period. This revenue increase was driven by strong performance in the freight aftermarket where both our proprietary Telair Europe powered freight handling equipment and our less proprietary nets and containers businesses all demonstrated growth in the quarter. This is not a surprise given the results reported on the freight market from others in the industry.","For our discretionary interiors aftermarket, a return to modest growth was a welcome change in Q1 of fiscal year 2018. However, although Q1 was better, we remain cautious on this market segment after a prolonged period of robust growth and a lack of visibility of new interior retrofit programs.","Finally, for the business jet helicopter aftermarket, which accounts for the final 15% of revenue in our total commercial aftermarket, sales were up in the low-single digits in Q1 of fiscal year 2018. Business jet takeoff and landing cycles have continued the modest improvement from prior quarters, an encouraging sign albeit still well off of the peak of the 2007 timeframe. The aftermarket in this segment tends to go through OEM as we've discussed previously. And as such, we do not have the same insight into this piece of the market. However, looking forward, some level of cautious optimism is required.","To summarize on our total commercial aftermarket, our passenger segment is demonstrating continued strength; the freight segment now showing solid performance for all of our business units; our discretionary interiors markets have shown an improved Q1 of fiscal year 2018, but stability in this market is as yet elusive. Business jet and helicopter aftermarket, there are favorable usage metrics in the industry, but we feel it's too early to tell if this will continue.","Now, let me speak about our defense market which remains relatively unchanged at about one-third of our total revenue. The defense market, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, were about flat versus prior-year Q1. Modest timing-related delays lowered our defense OEM shipments, while our defense aftermarket business grew slightly.","Today, defense bookings continue to provide an encouraging narrative as bookings for OEM and aftermarket both expanded by greater than 20% in the quarter. Defense market strength can at times be due to only a few businesses. However, revenue and bookings are well distributed and appear to be coming from most businesses in the total defense segment. As always, lumpy bookings and shipments like these are common in the defense market, and caution must be used in forecasting off of a few data points. Specifically, these strong bookings are not a direct tie to Q2 shipments.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis, Jim will provide more on the numbers, but let me touch on operating margin for TransDigm. The EBITDA As Defined margin for continuing operations came in at about 47.4% of revenues for Q1 of fiscal year 2018, an improvement year-over-year of just under 1 percentage point for the same period. Margin improvement progress is always a focus for us and indicates that our base business continues to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers.","A few examples. Recent product line acquisitions of Preece, Cablecraft and North Hills are being integrated into AdelWiggins, AeroControlex and Data Device Corporation respectively. These relocation integrations are an important part of our acquisition value-creation strategy, especially for product line acquisitions such as these. All of these moves will be completed within the year.","Additionally, in an ongoing effort to streamline and improve our cost structure, we periodically take the decision to consolidate some manufacturing locations to better drive organizational focus and productivity. We have recently announced the closure and relocation of our Dukes facility in Northridge, California to our Aero Fluid Products business in Northeast Ohio. This move will allow us to lower costs and leverage our customer relations and expertise to further grow what will become a product line for our Aero Fluid Products business.","Finally, let me speak to our organizational structure very briefly. As you are aware, Jim Skulina has accepted the role of Chief Financial Officer for TransDigm and, in doing so, has created a hole in our Executive Vice President leadership for our operating units. To backfill this need, we have promoted the following two individuals from within our President ranks: Alex Feil, who has been with TransDigm since 2002, working initially in sales in a number of business units before ultimately becoming the President of Schneller; and Rodrigo Rubiano, who has served as the President of Whippany Actuation Systems for the past three years. Both have been promoted to EVP, Executive Vice President, and will have a collection of business units reporting to them with Rodrigo eventually moving to Europe as our European EVP. This action will provide TransDigm with capacity to grow and take on future acquisitions and ensure culture carriers are in place for future succession needs.","So, let me conclude by stating, all in all, Q1 of fiscal year 2018 was another solid quarter for TransDigm. Focus on our value drivers of profitable new business, productivity and value pricing and the successful integration of our recent acquisitions will set us up for a strong 2018.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Skulina.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to expand on a few items included in our quarterly financial results and provide some color regarding the impact from tax reform. First quarter net sales were $848 million, up $34 million or approximately 4% greater than the prior year.","Our first quarter gross profit was $477 million, an increase of 7%. Our reported gross profit margin of 56.2% was 1.6 margin points higher than the prior year primarily due to lower non-operating acquisition-related costs, the strength of our proprietary products and a favorable product mix.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.6% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12.5% in the prior year. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $15 million, up 10% versus the prior quarter. This is primarily a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt of $11.9 billion in the current quarter versus $11 billion in the prior year.","During the quarter, we re-priced approximately $5 billion of our term loans to take advantage of better rates, decreasing LIBOR to plus 2.75% from LIBOR plus 3%. The expected annualized interest expense savings before fees is approximately $13 million related to this re-pricing. However, LIBOR has increased since our last earnings call. So, we are now currently assuming an average LIBOR of about 1.7% for the full year instead of 1.3%. The 1.7% assumes LIBOR rates approach 2% by the end of our fiscal year.","As a reminder, once the rates hit 2%, our credit swaps start to kick in. To analyze the impact of increasing LIBOR rates, there is an interest rate sensitivity table included in the slides we provided this morning. We are also actively looking to re-price to our loans, should the opportunity present itself. The net impact of re-pricing and related fees was offset by the increase in LIBOR rate. As a result, we still expect our full year interest expense to stay at approximately $650 million. Refinancing expense in the quarter was $1 million compared to $32 million in the prior year due to lower financing completed in Q1 of this year.","Now, moving on to taxes. The U.S. enacted the Tax Cut and Jobs Act on December 22 with significantly reduced tax rates in Q1. The statutory federal rate dropped from 35% to a blended 24.5% for our fiscal 2018 operations and to 21% for fiscal 2019 and after. The changes related to interest international operations and other law changes will not impact our effective tax rate until fiscal 2019. The Tax Act includes a one-time repatriation tax on historical foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We recorded a provisional $23 million charge during the quarter for the transitional repatriation tax. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $170 million related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances related to the U.S. tax law changes. As a result, the effective GAAP tax rate was a benefit of 63.4% for the current quarter compared to a 14.4% provision in the prior year.","We now estimate our full year GAAP tax rate to be around 6% to 7%, and the adjusted tax rate is estimated to be 9% to 10%. The cash tax rate is expected to be between 19% to 21%. The impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act after 2018 is a little less clear. Some of the regulations are not yet fully defined. For planning purposes, I would assume our GAAP tax rate will be slightly higher than the statutory rates going forward, as the interest expense GAAP will begin to impact us in 2019.","To answer the next obvious question, we do not see the tax law changes having an impact on our capitalization strategy. Debt will still be significant lowering cost (00:22:55) than equity despite the tax changes. Our net income from continuing operation in the quarter increased $193 million or 163% to $312 million, which is 37% of sales. This compares to net income of $119 million or 15% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects a low effective rate and to a lesser degree increases in net sales, lower refinancing costs and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher interest expense.","GAAP EPS and continuing operations was $4.60 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.41 per share last year. Both quarters were significantly impacted by the dividend equivalent payments paid on vested stock options of $56 million or $1.01 per share paid in the current quarter compared to $96 million or $1.70 per share paid in the prior period. Both payments were primarily related to the $46 of dividends we paid to shareholders in fiscal 2017.","As a reminder, the accounting treatment requires this payment to be deducted from the actual net income before earnings per share is calculated. Our adjusted EPS was $5.58 per share, an increase of 121% compared to $2.52 per share last year. This includes a $2.96 per share favorable impact from tax reforms. Excluding the favorable tax impact, current earnings per share increased 4% over the prior year. Please refer to table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconcile GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity. We generated almost $300 million of cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with $858 million of cash in the balance sheet. We are increasing our expected cash balance for the end of fiscal 2018 to be between $1.4 billion and 1.5 billion for the lower estimated cash taxes and to include the proceeds from the sale of Schroth. This assumes no additional acquisitions or capital structure activities.","Our net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.3 times pro forma EBITDA at the time, and gross leverage was 6.8 times pro forma EBITDA. We still estimate our net leverage in September 30, 2018 will be between 5.6 times and 5.8 times our EBITDA As Defined, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions. We currently have adequate capacity to make $1 billion to $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity. This capacity grew steadily to over $3 billion as the year proceeds.","With regard to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $15.61 per share, and we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $17.27. The Increase in both GAAP and adjusted EPS was due to the change in estimated effective tax rates related to tax reform. Please see slide 9 for a bridge detailing $1.66 of adjustments between GAAP to adjusted earnings per share related to our guidance.","In summary, Q1 was a good start to fiscal 2018.","Now, I'll hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Operator","Thank you, Kevin. So, we are ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks so much. Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Nick, can I \u2013 I thought we'll start on the Aerospace aftermarket. You had a very good first quarter. But your guidance for the year suggests that things are going to slow down from here. Was there anything unusual that you saw in Q1, or is this just a bit of natural caution given it's the start of the year?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's just a bit of natural caution, Rob. As I said, if sort of things hang in at the end of the next quarter, it wouldn't surprise me if we moved the guidance up. It's just, after some bouncing around over the last few years, we tend to believe that one data point doesn't \u2013 isn't enough to move on yet. But there's nothing quirky about it.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned you are active in the M&A arena at the moment. Was wondering if you can give us a little bit of color of what you're seeing out there in terms of the properties, if there is anything that's looking particularly strong or weak or attractive at the moment.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Rob, as you obviously \u2013 when I say we're active, we're active sort of I guess running around in circles or on a treadmill because we didn't close anything. But I mean, the same \u2013 it's the same kind of stuff. Proprietary businesses is what we're looking at. We have two or three or four we've been quite active in, but not substantively different than our patterns in the past.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Welcome, Jim.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Just a couple of quick ones on the OEM piece. I wonder if you might be able to elaborate a little bit more on the timing. I mean, I know we had some wide-body rates that are down. But did you see any destocking of any significance from the A350? I know a couple of other guys have talked about that this quarter.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'll lump that all into a wide-body opportunities pushing to the left and slow down some of the startup. So, the answer is, yes, across the board to the wide-body. Again, on that OEM side, we're not seeing any change in chipset content. So, the opportunities we have continue to grow and expand. It's just timing related. That's what we see so far.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Great. And on the freight piece, clearly, encouraging to see that bouncing a little bit here. Can you give us any color on just how significant that growth was either in bookings or shipments?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we don't want to \u2013 I was just trying to give you guys some color. We don't want to go through what we presented last year with all the details for the submarkets. It is up nicely. It's not unlike I think the demand in the industry. You've seen the FTK's freight tons shipped metrics out there that continue to grow. I think 2017 expanded at 9%. I can't tie our freight business to that, but just to say that there is both in the metrics and from what other folks are reporting, there's strength in the freight sector and we have seen it in our orders and shipments.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","All right. Thanks, Kevin. I'll hop back in the queue, guys.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's fair to say that, if anything, that's probably a little better than...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It is. It is.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for the time. Can we talk about the commercial aftermarket? It was up very nicely at 10%, but your EBITDA grew 5%. So, maybe just mix and what drove some of maybe the more muted profitability growth?","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kevin, do you want to...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. So, it's a good question. Our profitability was up close to 1% year-over-year. I know that, with the 10% growth in aftermarket, some would feel that maybe it should be higher. As we look through it, the shipments that we had, we were impacted by some margin softness on the defense side that lowered our margins as a whole business. Specifically, I look to the parachute business that we have; our Airborne businesses in North America and Europe. Certainly, we've seen some lumpiness in shipments and that has impacted some margins a bit across the business.","Beyond the shipments that we had available to us we shipped, that's the only thing that I can see that might explain or does explain the somewhat lower margin than we would have expected. Some headwinds on the defense side of the business specific to our parachute business, which we've seen in the past can be extremely lumpy and that came to pass this Q1 as well. Now, for the year, in those businesses, I think we still feel confident in our plans. That's just what we saw in the first quarter.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And for our year, we're still comfortable that we get up just a little under 50%.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah that's right. Good point. So, we have a first half and a second half ramp that is not unusual for us, getting close to the 50%, which is in our full year margin guidance. It's ramping over the year as per usual. I don't think there's any concern that we have that there is anything impacting us there.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Sure. Thanks, Kevin, for the color. And then, I guess, just one more. How does tax reform change capital deployment? Does it \u2013 how...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Can you speak up? We can't hear you. Could you speak up a little?","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Believe it or not, Nick, I'm yelling. But I always come off...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","All right. (33:28).","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","I'm loud. But how does tax reform change and interest rate deductibility change your acquisition hurdles from here?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Is the question, just to be clear I have it, how does the tax rules, the change in tax laws change our acquisition criteria?","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, exactly.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think it changes it at all. I mean, we go through the same math we always go through, maybe you pay a little net more for interest, but on the other hand, you pay less taxes in total. I doubt if it has any material impact.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell from RBC. Your line is now open.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just to follow up on the transport OEM sales decline, any \u2013 are you seeing any change in the portion of your sales that are sole sourced or are their pricing dynamics , or I'll just ask, as most of your biggest content programs are probably seeing increases in production rates, so anything else there that we should be thinking about?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Nothing that I can put my finger on. No changes in chipset content. No change to sole source position. No changes. It's very clear as I look across the business, there's really nothing to report there.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And maybe just another one on tax and how it might impact M&A; is it changing seller expectations in any way? I don't know if private companies are seeing better after-tax cash flow and that changes their willingness to sell. Is it impacting the M&A market in any way like that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","This is Nick, Matt. Not in a \u2013 I mean, if it is, it's too soon to tell. I suspect \u2013 I think that's probably slicing it too thin. I think people by and large make the decisions for sort of more macro issues than that, but it's too soon to tell. But I'd be very surprised.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. Nick, can you update us on the status of your partnering for success negotiations and when you expect to conclude them?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean I can tell you where we stand, which is, we really \u2013 there's no great progress going forward. We're in periodic discussions. The contract runs out at the end \u2013 Kevin, I want to say calendar year 2018.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Calendar year 2018, right? Not fiscal year 2018. I suspect there'll be little to report until we get very close to that. And we will still have the issue; if you recall, they typically conclude with a mutual confidentiality agreement which says you can't report a lot anyway.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. That makes sense. Thanks. And then, on the \u2013 it sounded like things were kind of tracking to your expectations in the interior retrofits business. But I was wondering kind of when you thought you might start to get some better visibility there given that I would think it's one of your aftermarket businesses that has a relatively large backlog relative to sales.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think, as the year progresses, we'll get more visibility on backlog, orders, business, as it splits out. There's a lot that the teams are working on, on retrofits and fleet upgrades that continues to be promising. So, time will tell as the orders are booked and placed. But there's a lot of activity. I think it's probably safe to say, I mean, we gave some rough guidance in the beginning of the year. We really don't see any need to change that now.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the time.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Kevin, a question for you on the aftermarket front. Are you seeing a growing incidence of interactions with Boeing at all as a customer there just given their push to take over some of the maintenance and procurement activities of some of the airlines?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I would say we're not seeing any activity there that is any different from the past. Nothing that I'm aware of.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a clarification or a quick question on the tax side. Can you maybe just go over what you're expecting the tax rate to be going forward? I think, before, you're highlighting no real benefit from tax reform, but that seems to maybe have a changed a bit. Maybe I'm just misreading what you guys are highlighting now.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Let me try \u2013 at least, I'll just answer the cash. And, Jim, you can answer the rest of it. I think, as we said, we expect $20 million extra cash this year in 2018. So, that's one clear benefit. And, Jim, do you want...","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, is your question 2018 or 2019 going forward?","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, more of the rest of fiscal 2018 and then just on a go-forward basis of 2019 and beyond, both tax rate and maybe from a GAAP perspective and then a cash perspective.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's a little bit hard to forecast 2019 and forward. All the regulations aren't yet fully defined. We believe it's going to be slightly higher than the statutory rate of 21%. The interest rate cap of 30% EBITDA kicks in, in 2019 to 2021. That's going to be \u2013 that's the piece you should probably take a look at that will impact us the most. But it's still going to be down from where it has been historically. So, it's still going to be positive for TransDigm. So \u2013 if you're going to \u2013 for planning purposes, slightly higher than the statutory rate of 21% is what I suggest you use.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I think it's safe to say, Jim, that we will be reasonably significantly (00:39:59), correct.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Versus what it would have been otherwise.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I just wanted to ask first, on the defense side, I mean, you highlighted or called out some really strong bookings for both the OE and the aftermarket. Can you just remind us again maybe how the business splits on the defense between OE and aftermarket or maybe what portion of your sales are book and ship? I mean, it sounded like you were clearly not wanting to get too excited about the bookings, specifically, as it relates to the second quarter. But how should we think about this from a timing standpoint or the business mix?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, you asked a few things there. Let me \u2013 just to \u2013 for the split of OEM and aftermarket for defense business, it about splits like the rest of our business, 40%, 60%; 45%, 55% about on with the rest of the business of OEM being slightly less than the aftermarket.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","What were the follow-up pieces to your question again? Can you repeat those?","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Just how much of the businesses is book and ship perhaps or what's the timing with the really strong bookings because it sounded like you were a little cautious about direct read-through to the second quarter?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I do that because sometimes we give more \u2013 we try to give some bookings guidance and there's always confusion about when that will come in. We book \u2013 we allow our businesses to place orders that \u2013 or put orders into the booking system that are due in the next two years. So, on the defense side, you have a lot more planning into the future on both the OEM and aftermarket side. So, I was cautious that I wouldn't expect Q2 to go up some dramatic number. We're confident with our guidance on the defense side, and we see the opportunities coming in and the order book seems to support that. That's \u2013 it's just caution as well as the timing of defense orders and when they're due to be shipped.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Kevin, we don't know that we can draw any conclusion versus our year yet other than it's \u2013 you got to look at it as a positive rather than \u2013 it's a kind of a favorable data point.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah. And if I could just one on the commercial aftermarket, I'm just curious with the OEM sort of getting maybe a little bit more aggressive on the aftermarket airframe OEMs. Has anything changed in your thinking or philosophy around distributors and maybe the types of distributors you use or for your aftermarket business going direct versus distributors?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We use distributors significantly in aftermarket. That is something that I think will continue. We always evaluate our relations on a business unit by business unit. But as a company, TransDigm, we do not direct our business units what to do. They have that local autonomy that we encourage as a key part of our culture. So, they make decisions on what's best for their business. The major distributors that we track and sometimes report on, they only make up 25% to 30% of our business. So, we already take a considerable amount of our aftermarket business direct. So, moving distributors is a small part of the aftermarket business and is really up to the individual business units to decide on. That's what we see and how we drive the business.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you very much, Kevin.","Kevin M.

But did you give details on the commercial aftermarket bookings? I know you talked about the strength in defense on the OE and aftermarket. But any color on how the commercial aftermarket trended in the quarter?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. The bookings \u2013 we didn't talk about it. The bookings are \u2013 we didn't give a specific number. But the bookings are coming in ahead of the revenues...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","The book-to-ships is up.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then, just sticking with the aftermarket, we're seeing a lot of provisioning strength in the marketplace on some of the newer platforms. You obviously had a good growth this quarter. I know you're hesitant to change anything for the rest of the year. But are you seeing any \u2013 on some of your products where you have positions on those new airframes? Are you seeing any provision-related growth in that aftermarket?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. Generally speaking, provisioning \u2013 initial provisioning is not a significant piece for us. And so, we don't see provisioning as a headwind or a tailwind to any given quarter or year.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then, just last one. Any color on the defense booking strength, specific product lines or platforms?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's largely spread across our business units as well. In the past, we had called out a unit here or there that had significant bookings in a quarter, and that's not been the case. It is nicely spread both on the bookings and shipments across all of our business units \u2013 or most of our business units, I should say. And so, it's nicely spread. It's not due to one program or one product or one company.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.

Good morning. Nick, can you comment on your comfort with leverage here? Just in terms of \u2013 in the past, I think you've talked about willingness to go to seven or eight times for the right acquisition. Is that still your level of comfort given tax reform in the market and where we are in the cycle?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think the tax reform changes my view on that. I mean, the fundamental question \u2013 the fundamental issue there is that debt is very substantially cheaper than equity on an after-tax basis. And to the extent you're comfortable carrying it, which a business like this should with its stability you ought to be very biased on the debt side, if you want to maximize the equity return. I don't think the tax law changes that. I think it's a fairly small tweak in the calculus there.","What was the other question? On the leverage level, I would say, as a practical matter, in the marketplace, you've been limited to around seven times in the last probably year or so. That may be loosening up a little bit, but it's too soon to tell.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And you mentioned an active M&A pipeline.

Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I can't say there's any \u2013 I can't say there's disproportionately large group of candidates.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. And is it mostly private or there are also some public?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","All of the above.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Which does not \u2013 as I say all the time, predicting closing rates or closures is very difficult.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. Last one for you, Nick. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about your plans, this comp agreement that goes a number of years and just what do you see kind of in the next five years do you expect to be with the firm and in the same role or if any of your thoughts have evolved on that.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think my thoughts have changed from all the things I've shared with people. As you know, I have a contract that runs out through 2019, and that contemplates at some point I would transition into a role like, say, an Executive Chairman that would be probably maintain a reasonable amount of responsibility for capital allocation, M&A activity and things like that. I don't think my thoughts have changed on that. I'm in no hurry to get out of here and no hurry to disengage.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning. How do you think about the risks and the opportunities prevented from Boeing potentially forming a JV with Embraer?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't -- I can't really assess that. I don't see whether there's any being particular impact us to that. Embraer is one of many customers for airplanes, not disproportionately large or small.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think probably is always risky, but I'll say it anyway. I think we \u2013 our content with Canadair is larger than our content in Embraer. Just to put it into context. But Embraer is a good...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good account.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good account \u2013 good partnership we have.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","I got you. And then, Nick, last time where you said \u2013 last May, you talked about there have been no growth \u2013 real growth in commercial aftermarket revenues in terms of pricing \u2013 X pricing over the last few years. It's early in the year obviously. But given the start you're off of 10% commercial aftermarket revenues and the way you just said about bookings being up more than that, are you hesitating to raise the guide even they are suggesting it's obviously impossible? But are you hesitant \u2013 you raised the guide so soon because maybe you are seeing some pricing improvements and you haven't seen that in so many years that you're hesitant to sort of bank on it?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","All of it. I never said we weren't seeing pricing improvements.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","I thought you're saying that there was no growth like X pricing or whatever it was last May?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","What I said is across the industry. What I said is, last year, we went through a road show and also posted it up on our website a look at the organic growth across the industry and for ourselves, and we concluded that, over the last five years, if you strip out price, the commercial aftermarket in total growth was de minimis. I guess that's what you're referring to.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. I guess I misinterpreted that, but...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't \u2013 just to be clear \u2013 I don't think we ever said that there was particular pricing pressure.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It was the underlying real growth and we saw that across the whole industry when we went through all the public comps of our competitors. I would say 10% is obviously better than that. The prices aren't up 10%. So that's obviously is real growth. And are we a little wary because of the volatility in the last three or four years? Yeah, we are. Hopefully, that's not to say that we would very much like to be wrong, and I think we feel quite comfortable with our guidance. And as I said, if it hangs in pretty well, it wouldn't surprise me if we bumped it up next quarter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","I got it. Thank you very much.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But we're reticent \u2013 as we said at the beginning of the year, unless our guidance changes outside of the ranges, we're going to stick with our original guidance until we think we have a material change.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Lipke from Stephens. Your line is open.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe just sticking on that last point there and to your commentary last May about traffic no longer really driving after market volume just due to the impact of younger aircraft. I'm curious, if you look at the number of aircraft that are reaching five years in service, maybe just using that as a proxy, you know it kind of points to double-digit growth in calendar 2017, high-single digit growth in 2018 and 2019. And I think the ultimate conclusion from that was that the aircraft coming on lease was a bigger factor. So it seems like we should be seeing that now. And I'm curious, are you seeing that come to fruition or not and can you just kind of talk around that a little bit?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think you saw the quarter. I would say \u2013 and I just want to emphasize, one quarter \u2013 one data point doesn't make a trend. But, obviously, what we saw in the first quarter, we view it as a positive.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I was just thinking...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I also think as we went through this last year, I don't think this is something that changes rapidly. This age of the \u2013 this aircraft over percent (53:48) less than five years and over five years, that doesn't make a step change that sort of a gradual thing is it changes. It'll change fastest if the production rates drop off, that doesn't mean we're cheerleading for production rates to drop off. But, just mathematically, that'll happen. But I think you have to look at the first quarter as a good data point.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","And I think you guys always talk about rolling four quarter averages for your commercial aftermarket organic growth. And I think the last four quarters it's been kind of 4%, and that includes price. And so, I mean, maybe is that a reason that we should point to for the mid-single digit growth maintaining for fiscal 2018 for that guidance?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we gave you the guidance for the year and I think we're telling you is that's the guidance we continue to stick with. If we see \u2013 if we get more data points that would make us think differently, then we'd likely adjust it, but as of right now, I think we're comfortable just staying with it.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then just a quick one maybe for Jim; it looks like you restated the December 2016 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings lower and I wasn't quite clear in the release as to why that was, perhaps I missed it, but can you just talk through that a little bit?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Oh, from Q1?","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Yes. 2016, fiscal 2017?","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","All right. Yeah. Basically what we did \u2013 from Q1 of 2017, we basically aligned our EBITDA As Defined with our credit agreement. All right? So, when we report EBITDA As Defined, the As Defined is basically per our credit agreement, we found a disconnect in that we were including the FX adjustments for revaluating the balance sheet. So we went back and corrected that.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","In both periods.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","In both periods, so that we had apples-and-apples, correct.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Sir, your line is now open.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah.

Are you guys seeing any impact from that or when would you start to feel an impact if it got extended again?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't \u2013 you know, by the time that dribbles down to our level of buy, it's awful hard to see. I would be surprised if we see much.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But the truth is that's going to dribble its way, way down the waterfall before it gets to our waters.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't see much change at least now. If you made some assumptions, it's going to be a substantive dislocation in defense spending and we start to see that, but I don't see people saying that.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, just a quick one, Jim, a clarification. You said net leverage by the end of the year if you did no M&A or any sort of cash to shareholders.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It was 5.6% to 5.8%.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Which is what we said at the beginning of the year.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, no change.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W.

Nicholas Howley","Good morning, and thanks again for calling in here about our company. As I usually do, I'll start off with some comments about our consistent strategy, then an overview of a busy fiscal year '13, the financial performance and some market summary for '13 and our initial guidance for fiscal year 2014. A fair amount to cover.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize why believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, around 3\/4 of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider; excluding the small non-aviation business, about 54% of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced higher gross margins and it provided relative stability in the down cycles.","Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditure requirements, we have, year-in and year-out, generated very strong free cash flow.","We pay close attention to our capital structure and view it as another means to create shareholder value. As you know, we have, in the past and continue to be willing to level up when we either see good opportunities or view our leverage as suboptimal for value creation. We typically begin to delever pretty quickly. In keeping with that philosophy, we paid out $2 billion of special dividends and related payments in fiscal year 2013 or about 25% of our beginning of the year market equity value.","During the year, we also raised about $4.3 billion of both senior debt and high-yield bonds at an average interest rate of around 4.4%. About $2.2 billion of this was used to reduce our interest expense, extend maturities and increase flexibility.","After paying the special dividend -- dividends and making 3 significant acquisitions for about $475 million, we closed fiscal year 2013 with about $565 million in cash, $300 million in unrestricted undrawn revolver and additional capacity under our credit agreement. We ended the year with a net leverage of about 5.5x EBITDA.","Just to run through again, in deciding to pay out the special dividend this year, we look loosely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you again, we basically have 4. Our priorities are typically as follows: first, invest in our existing business; and second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. These 2 are always our first choice. Third, we can pay off debt, but given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions. And lastly, we can give the extra back to the shareholders either through a special dividend or stock buyback, as you saw us do this year.","As we looked at all our likely needs for acquisitions and internal investment requirements, we believe, based on what we knew then and know today, that we had adequate cash and or debt capacity for our near or midterm needs. Combining that with historically low interest rates and extensive capital availability, we have an opportunity to accelerate returns to our shareholders while maintaining adequate liquidity and borrowing capacity to meet our near and midterm operating and acquisition needs, thus a roughly $3 billion of payouts. At 9\/30\/13, based on current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated levels of acquisition in 2014.","We have a well-proven value-based operating strategy focused around what we refer to as our 3 value drivers, new business development, continual cost improvement and value-based pricing. We stick to these as the core of our operating management methodology. This consistent approach has worked for us through up and down markets, while allowing us to steadily invest in new business and platform positions.","We have also been successful in regularly acquiring and integrating businesses. We acquire businesses with proprietary aerospace products and significant aftermarket content when able to acquire and improve aerospace businesses through all phases of the cycle.","As you probably know, in fiscal year '13, we acquired 3 such aerospace businesses, with over $200 million of combined revenues and about $45 million of EBITDA, for a total price of approximately $475 million. All 3 of these businesses are proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content and we expect all to generate returns above our private equity life targets.","Through our consistent focus on our operating value drivers, a clear acquisition strategy and very close attention to our capital structure and capital allocation, we've been able to create intrinsic value for our shareholders for many years through up and down markets.","I'd like to address now the status of our commercial aftermarket. In our fiscal year -- in our Q3 of this fiscal year, we believe we began to see signs of a market recovery. We, as many in the industry, have been a bit surprised by how long this soft market has continued, especially in light of the decent underlying market trends. The reported Q4 commercial aftermarket revenues were flat and the annual revenues were roughly flat. However, the quarterly comps are messy, with a lot of noise, particularly around some of the acquisitions. As we dig deeper, we see this early stage in spotty recovery appears to have continued into our fiscal year Q4.","To expand on this a little bit and share with you how we look at this internally, our pro forma revenues on a same-store basis for Q4 normalized, primarily for changes in business practices at recently acquired acquisitions, distributor changes and some related inventory movements, appear to have trended up in the range of 4% versus the prior Q4 at about the same percent sequentially.","Additionally, we take weekly samples of direct sales of our spare parts to airlines, both from certain operating units and our larger distributors. This is a sample of a significant percent of our spare parts revenues and showed increases a bit above the mid-single-digit percent, both in Q4 of fiscal year '13 versus the prior, as well as Q4 fiscal year '13 versus Q3 or sequentially. So roughly in the same range as the normalization adjustment I talked about above.","I would say it's too soon here to declare victory. We're very comfortable with our market positions. I doubt this recovery will be linear. I suspect there'll be quarterly ups and downs. Many forecasters, however, believe and our data seems to indicate that we are at or past the commercial aftermarket inflection point. Time will of course tell here.","As a point of interest, as we look at Q1 of fiscal year '14, it has about 10% less working or shipping days than Q4 fiscal year '13. So it may be tough to see an absolute sequential improvement.","Now to summarize fiscal year 2013. It was a busy year. As I said before, we raised about $4.3 billion of debt. We acquired Arkwin for $286 million. We acquired the GE Whippany actuation business for $149 million. We acquired Aerosonics for $40 million. We paid out $2 billion or about 25% of our initial market value in 2 special dividends. We continued integration of our various acquisitions. And we dealt with a softer commercial aftermarket than we anticipated. All the while, we think we continue to generate real intrinsic value in our new and existing businesses.","Turning to the performance. I remind you again, this is the first quarter and full year for fiscal -- and full year report for our fiscal year 2013. Our year ends September 30. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by OEM aftermarket mix, large orders, inventory fluctuations in the system, modest seasonality and the like.","Although the commercial aftermarket was soft, fiscal year '13 was generally a good year for TransDigm. GAAP revenues were up 17% versus the prior Q4 and 13% on a full year basis.","Pro forma revenues, that is if we own the same mix of businesses, was up about 5% on a quarter-versus-quarter and about 3% on a full year basis.","Reviewing the revenue by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus the prior Q4, that's assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.","In the commercial markets, which make up roughly 3\/4 of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 10% versus prior Q4 and 7% on a full year basis. This is primarily driven by commercial transport OEM revenues. The commercial transport growth rate primarily reflects increase in airframe production rates.","The smaller full year business jet segment growth was lower, more like in the 3% range. I remind you that total commercial aerospace OEM was up 23% the prior year.","Total commercial aftermarket revenue comps are a bit messy, as I said before. As I described, normalized on a Q4 versus Q4 basis, they appear to be trending up roughly in the mid-single-digit range and about the same sequentially.","Our individual operating units continue to be a little spotty, was about 3\/4 or 75% of our units on the same basis were up in Q4 '13 versus the prior year Q4.","The defense markets, which roughly make up 1\/4 of our revenue, our defense revenue continues better than we anticipated. Revenues were up about 11% versus the prior year fourth quarter and 7% on a full year versus full year basis. The U.K. Ministry of Defence new Tarian product shipments made up about 2% of the full year 7% growth. Adjusted for the U.K. order, full year incoming orders are still running slightly ahead of shipments. We remain cautious about trends in the military. In total for the year, our revenues for commercial aftermarket were lower, while commercial OEM and military revenues were better than we expected going into the year.","Now moving along to profitability. I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The as defined adjustments in Q4 were primarily due to acquisition-related cost. Our EBITDA of about $248 million for Q4 was up 15% versus the prior Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA As Defined, again, was just about $900 million, or up about 11% from the prior year. The EBITDA As Defined Margin was about 46% of revenues for Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA margins were just about 47%. The full year margins was diluted about 2% from the impact of acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, the commercial aftermarket mix. The Q4 margin was also diluted about 2.5%, primarily for the same reasons.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue actively looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is pretty active. It's about the same mix of sizes as we usually see. We're seeing a bit more defense-related businesses than we probably have in the past. Closings are tough to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on the value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Now moving on to 2014 guidance, which I think is Slide 6. Once again, military businesses budget is unclear. The rate of recovery in the commercial aftermarket seems to be turning up but is still somewhat uncertain heading into 2014. This is our best current estimate. As the year proceeds, we'll let you know if our views change. But based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions in 2014, our guidance is as follows: the midpoint of our 2014 revenue guidance is about $2.19 billion or $2.2 billion or up 14% on a GAAP basis. At the midpoint of the guidance, the growth is roughly half organic, with the balance coming from a full year of acquisitions.","Fiscal year -- Q1 fiscal year 2014 is currently anticipated to be lower than the other quarters, roughly in the same relationship as you've seen in past years.","The midpoint of 2014 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.02 billion or about 47% of revenue. This includes about 1.5% of margin dilution from prior acquisitions. The businesses, excluding the 3 acquisitions, are anticipated to have margins of approximately 49%. In total, this EBITDA is up about 13% year-over-year. The mid point of our EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $7.16 a share or up about 4% versus the prior year. This is negatively impacted by interest expense, tax rate and a higher share count. Greg will review the details.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket revenue growth is assumed to be in the high-single digits based on worldwide RPM growth of about 4% to 5%. We are still cautious here and expect growth to be lower in the first half than the second half of our fiscal year. We anticipate seeing our revenues begin to more closely reconnect to air travel as the year proceeds.","Defense military revenues is estimated to be about flat versus 2013. This assumes no significant additional sequestration impact. We'll continue to evaluate this, of course, as the situation unfolds.","The commercial OEM revenue growth is anticipated to be in the high single-digit percent range. Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have almost $1 billion in cash at the end of '14, $300 million in undrawn revolver. Assuming no acquisitions, our net leverage is -- or capital structure activity, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.6x EBITDA at the end of 2014. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement.","In summary, 2013 was a decent year and a tougher commercial aftermarket environment than we expected. Hopefully, this sector has turned and the political situation stabilizes. But in any event, I'm confident that our consistent, value-focused strategy and strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors.","Now let me hand it over to Ray, who will discuss some of the operating high points of the year.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thanks, Nick. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fourth quarter and a good finish to another very busy year. The consistent application of our operating value drivers and the successful integration of our most recent acquisitions continue to add solid value to TransDigm.","Let me explain a little more detail our fiscal 2013 and fourth quarter operational value creation. In spite of a small economy, we were able to apply our value drivers and create real value. As Nick mentioned, our year-over-year pro forma growth was about 3%. A higher mix of commercial OEM work, coupled with the lower commercial aftermarket revenue, made managing our cost structure challenging. However, we continue to manage our resources tightly and we were able to continue to reduce our pro forma and total headcount. Our continuing productivity efforts included consolidating certain acquired manufacturing operations, strategically sourcing material from efficient domestic and offshore sources and moving various manufacturing operations to our Mexico, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and China facility.","Lastly, we continue to invest in our existing domestic facilities, keeping them up-to-date and productive. We also continue to improve innovative -- we also continue to provide innovative new business solutions to our broad customer base. We have successfully expanded our platform content with significant new business in both the commercial and military markets.","In the commercial transport market, we have developed many new applications and here's a few recent examples. Hartwell has been awarded the development contract for engine cowl latches on the A320neo. They're also developing the tail cone and belly fairing engines and latches on the Airbus A350.","Champion recently developed and was awarded the ignition systems for the A350 auxiliary power unit.","Adams Rite Aerospace is developing the laboratory faucets, valves, water heaters and various door latches on the 737 MAX. They're also actively providing upgraded water, conserving laboratory faucets and equipment for several airlines, existing triple 7 fleets.","Our Dukes unit is providing a de-icing system, bleed air valves for the Bombardier CSeries and also for the Mitsubishi Regional Jets. Likewise, on those 2 platforms, AdelWiggins continues to expand their composite fuel and hydraulic isolator applications.","Our engineered laminates continue to be specified on upgrades to business class seats, cabin walls and flooring.","Schneller has been awarded the Singapore Airlines' triple 7 fleet business class seats laminate refurbishment. Delta has also selected them to provide the laminates for their Boeing 717 interior refurbishment program. And American is using Schneller laminates on their upgrade business class seats for their A321 and triple 7 fleets.","On the new Bell 525 relentless helicopter, Adams Rite providing the door bolting systems. Aero Fluid Products is providing 7 fuel system valves and AeroControlex is providing the in-tank fuel boost pumps, the APU loop pumps and various pitot tube probes for sensing airspeed.","In the military markets, we continue to be selected to provide upgrade on the C-130J. Our Avionic Instruments group is now supplying the upgraded A400-amp transformer XFIRE units that supply low static, clean electrical power on the aircraft's upgraded avionic and electrical systems.","Our AmSafe cargo unit has developed automatic quick drop cargo release actuation systems, which allow military helicopters to automatically and quickly release on their swung cargo loads remotely from the cockpit, thus reducing ground crew risk and speeding the military operational tempo.","On the new Cessna Scorpion, which they just unveiled as their newest attack jet, AeroControlex group has been awarded 8 throttle control actuators and gearbox applications.","Champion will be supplying igniters, Duke is supplying several engine and windshield anti-icing valves and Electromech is providing pitch trim and roll trim motor actuators.","On the Alenia Aermacchi M-346, Avionic Instruments has won an order to supply 3 phase electrical power inverters that provide upgraded clean power and expands electrical capacity of the aircraft.","And on the C-17, Avionic Instruments is also supplying frequency converters that provide hospital grade 230 volt electrical power for a central airborne medical equipment.","These new engineered solutions and many others not discussed continue to expand our profitable product offering and add to future growth.","In fiscal 2013, we also acquired 3 proprietary aerospace businesses: Aerosonic, Arkwin and Whippany Actuation. Integrating these businesses created a flurry of integration and value creation activity and we quickly went to work on transitioning these businesses into TransDigm value creation mode. As we have done with each prior acquisition, we applied our proven value creation process. We restructure the businesses into product line focus groups and implemented our value creation metrics. We focused the engineering and new business efforts on winnable and profitable new business and we tightened up the cost structures.","Again, I'd like to switch gears and talk about our management team. These acquisitions drove a significant number of management structure changes. Our continual emphasis on succession planning and talent development again paid off well for us. We were able to populate almost all of the key management positions with internal candidates. These proven candidates are steeped in our value focused culture and value creation processes.","During 2013, we promoted Jorge Valladares to Executive Vice President. Prior to his promotion, Jorge has been an operating unit president at both AdelWiggins and more recently, AvtechTyee. Jorge has also had significant acquisition integration assignments.","We also added 6 new division presidents, all 6 were internal promotions. These internal promotions bring the strong TransDigm value creation culture to their operating units.","Then below the division presidents level, we've added 17 senior operational function managers, 16 of the 17 were also internal promotions. We believe our succession planning and talent development system is working. We have a good pipeline of talented people exposed to our value-creation methods and our defined training programs. We believe the availability of promotable internal talent and our consistent succession development process effectively complements our disciplined value-creation method and is key to our ability to regularly acquire and integrate new businesses.","Now let me hand it over to Greg, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Gregory Rufus","Thanks, Ray. Before we review the financials, you may recall, last quarter, I described in depth some of the unique items that would impact our fiscal third and fourth quarters. We incorporated all of these items in last quarter's full year guidance but to review them, first, in early July, we raised $1.4 billion of additional debt to pay a $22 special dividend on July 25, directly related to the special dividend we paid $95 million in dividend equivalent payment to holders of vested stock options. You will see the impact of the additional dividend equivalent payment in our GAAP earnings per share and the additional financing increased interest expense in our fourth quarter results.","Second, we successfully closed the 3 acquisitions for a total purchase price of about $475 million in our fiscal third quarter. As a result, higher acquisition costs and purchase price accounted items were recorded in the fourth quarter.","Lastly, in the third quarter, we adopted segment reporting and are now reporting on 3 segments. Just to remind you, the power and control segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that predominantly provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic, fluid, power and mechanical motion control technology. Year-to-date sales for this segment are $872 million, which represents 45% of our total sales. The EBITDA As Defined is $456 million or 52% of sales and represents 49% of our total segment EBITDA As Defined.","The airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that are used in nonpower airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies. Year-to-date sales for this segment are $951 million, which represents approximately 50% of our total sales. The EBITDA As Defined is $440 million or 47% of sales and represents 48% of our total segment EBITDA As Defined.","The non-aviation segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market products for non-aviation markets. Year-to-date sales for this segment are $101 million, which represents 5% of our total sales. The EBITDA As Defined is $24 million or 23% of sales and represents 3% of our total segment EBITDA As Defined.","And with that, let me now review the consolidated financials on Slide 7. Fourth quarter net sales were $540 million, up $77 million or 17% from the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions, primarily Arkwin and Whippany and Aerosonic, contributed approximately $57 million of the additional sales for the prior period. Our organic sales growth was about 6% over the prior year, primarily due to the commercial OEM and defense markets.","Reported gross profit was $283 million or 52.4% of sales. The reported gross profit margin was approximately 3 margin points less than the prior year margin of 55.5%. The dilutive impact of acquisition mix from primarily Arkwin, Whippany and Aerosonic was approximately 2 margin points. In addition, an increase in nonoperating acquisition-related costs, that is primarily inventory step-up and start-up expenses resulting from the 3 acquisitions we acquired in June, reduced gross profit margin by approximately 1.5 margin points.","Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the base business versus the prior year quarter were up modestly despite unfavorable OEM aftermarket mix, which negatively impacted the current quarter.","Selling and administrative expenses were 11.3% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.7% for the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a lower run rate of stock compensation expense as a result of the accelerated vesting of $2.4 million stock options that occurred last quarter and that was partially offset by higher acquisition related costs.","Net interest expense was $81 million, an increase of approximately $26 million versus the prior year quarter. This is a result of an increase in our weighted average outstanding borrowings to $5.7 billion in the current quarter versus $3.6 billion in the prior year. The additional debt was incurred to fund the $12.85 dividend paid in November and the $22 dividend paid in July. We used cash to fund the acquisitions.","The weighted average cash interest rate on total debt at the end of the current quarter is approximately 5.4% compared to 5.7% at the end of last year.","Our effective tax rate for the year was 32.5% for fiscal 2013 compared to 33.4% for fiscal 2012.","Net income for the quarter decreased $4 million or 4% to $84 million, which is 16% of sales. This compares to net income of $88 million in the prior year. The decrease in net income primarily reflects the higher interest expense and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the growth in net sales and the lower effective tax rate.","Our GAAP loss per share was $0.20 per share in the current quarter compared to earnings of $1.63 per share a year ago. In addition to the increased interest expense and other items previously mentioned, the current quarter reported loss per share was significantly impacted by the $95 million of dividend equivalent payments or $1.67 per share in connection with the $22 dividend.","If you recall, the accounting treatment requires this payment to be deducted from the actual net income before earnings per share is calculated. The details of this calculation are included on Table 3 of this morning's press release.","The adjusted earnings per share was $1.75 per share, an increase of 2% compared to $1.72 per share last year. In addition to higher interest expense just mentioned, the fourth quarter earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.10 due to higher share count of 56.9 million shares compared to 53.9 million shares in the prior period.","Since this is our fiscal year end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize the full year results. Net sales increased $224 million or by 13% to end our year at $1.9 billion. Acquisitions contributed approximately 75% of the increase in sales.","Reported gross profit dollars increased 11% and was 54.5% of sales compared to 55.6% in the prior year. The full year margin would be closer to 58% after adjustment for the dilutive impact of acquisitions and unfavorable OEM to aftermarket mix versus 57% on the same basis in the prior year.","Selling and administrative expenses of 13.2% of sales for fiscal '13 is higher than the 11.9% of sales in fiscal '12, due primarily to the higher noncash stock compensation expense. This expense as a percent of sales increased to 2.2% this year from 1.1% in the prior year. Additionally, the current year includes incrementally higher acquisition rate cost about a half a point.","Net interest expense increased $59 million due to the additional debt incurred to fund the 2 special dividends, as previously mentioned.","In addition, fiscal 2013 included $3 million of refinancing costs associated with refinancing the senior secured credit facility this past February.","GAAP net income was $303 million or 16% of sales. GAAP earnings per share was $2.39 per share compared to $5.97 per share a year ago. However, on an adjusted basis, which excludes the dividend equivalent payments, the noncash compensation cost and the acquisition-related and refinancing costs, earnings per share was $6.90 per share this year, up 3% from $6.67 a year ago.","When comparing GAAP EPS of $2.39 per share to the current year -- in the current year to the adjusted net income of $6.90 per share, the difference of $4.51 is comprised of the following items: $3.11 related to the dividend equivalent payments; $0.60 for noncash compensation expense, this includes an additional $25 million of expense in quarter 3 due to the accelerated vesting of options; $0.41 for acquisition related expenses, including integration costs such as startup, inventory purchase accounting adjustments and backlog amortization; and $0.39 for refinancing costs and other charges. It was a hectic year, but well worth it.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity. The company generated $470 million of cash from operating activities. After consideration of the financing discussed, dividends paid and acquisitions made, we closed the year with $565 million of cash on the balance sheet.","The company's gross debt levered at September of 2013 was approximately 6.1x pro forma EBITDA and 5.5x on a net basis.","As we look forward to FY '14, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $6.32 and, as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $7.16.","As we disclosed on Slide 9, the $0.84 of adjustments to bridge GAAP EPS to the adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.33 for dividend equivalent payments versus the $3.11 this year; $0.30 for noncash stock comp expense versus $0.60 this year; and $0.21 of carryforward activity related to the Arkwin, Whippany and Aerosonic acquisitions.","Nick provided color on the FY '14 sales and EBITDA As Defined. I will walk through and explain why adjusted net income for share only increased 4% despite sales and EBITDA As Defined growth of approximately 13%. All growth percentages assume the midpoint of the guidance.","Depreciation and amortization and that's excluding the backlog amortization, is expected to total $72 million. This is a 9% increase over '13.","Interest expense is expected to increase approximately 20% or almost $54 million to $325 million in FY '14. We used the weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.","Our effective tax rate in FY '14 is expected to increase to be around 34% compared to the 32.5% this year.","And our adjusted net income will be up about 8% versus FY '13.","Finally, our weighted average shares outstanding will increase about 4% to be approximately 57.2 million compared to 55.1 million this year.","As a result of these items, the adjusted earnings per share of $7.16 is approximately 4% greater than fiscal '13.","Finally, with regards to our liquidity and leverage, we expect to generate $450 million of cash. Again, assuming no acquisition activity, we expect our gross debt leverage to be approximately 5.6x EBITDA As Defined and our net leverage ratio will be near 4.6x our EBITDA As Defined at September 30, 2014, or almost a full term of deleverage.","Now with that, let me hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland, Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. The first on the margin, the comment you made, Nick, around the core business at 49% next year. It looks like that's comparable to where you're exiting this year and you don't -- you're not implying any adverse mix shift OE versus aftermarket or commercial versus military. But there is -- there should be some good volume leverage there. I wondered if you might just elaborate on why it doesn't seem to be any expansion there?","W. Nicholas Howley","I don't know if I can answer that, Greg. Greg?","Gregory Rufus","I didn't follow that either. We've been going back and forth in so many different margins.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes. The question, I guess, was at least when you do the adjustments and you adjust the other one, it looked like margins are about flat. Does that...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If you take the 47% and you add back the 200 basis points, you get to 49% on the core business, which is what you're guiding to for next year. So you've got some incremental volume and you don't have the same mix headwinds for next year, so I was just wondering why it wasn't up.","Gregory Rufus","No, we do have some special non-repeat items this year. So when I looked at it my way, I was getting the margin improvement of about 1.5...","W. Nicholas Howley","Yeah, I thought you were, too, that's why...","Gregory Rufus","Carter, you've got to take FY '13 because we booked -- we still have 1 or 2 what we call onetime favorable adjustments or events that took place.","W. Nicholas Howley","We think the number -- we think the underlying organic number is about 1 point.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","1 point of expansion?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. I think that's -- Greg says a hair more, by the way.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. On the revenue side, the pro forma versus normalized aftermarket growth, it sounds like you pulled something out of distribution. Did that happen this quarter?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, maybe...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Will this have some impacts in the next couple of quarters?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. That's worth a little clarification. I mean, there's a couple of things. Carter, when we -- the data points we were getting and the stuff we were picking up in the industry and the data points we're picking right now, didn't seem to exactly jive with our segment number said. So we dug into that a little more and there were probably 8 to 10 items that impacted that. And you have big ones, or the most significant ones are, I'll say, primarily acquisition related. And some of them are -- make things a little higher in the previous quarter and some of them make things lower in this quarter. But let me give you a sense of it. The Whippany business that we bought from GE, the distributor inventories were too high. I think we told you this last quarter. And we decided when we bought, we saw this in diligence and decided we had to draw them down. So we purposely drew down their inventories this quarter and that will continue a little into next year. At the Arkwin business that we bought, they had a consignment inventory agreement with a distributor. We, essentially, that they recognize -- had recognized, sort of the way they looked at it, was in a similar consignment, it was a sale. We did away with that and changed the contract, but that essentially meant we didn't recognize the ones that revenue be recognized because we had burned off the consignment inventory distributor. We divested a -- if you may or may not recall, we divested a distribution business in Q4 of last year, but we didn't sell the AmSafe net product line with it. We kept that ourselves, then we had to find and restock another distributor in the prior Q4. And we also replaced the Pacific Rim distributor for one of our recent acquisitions and that sure got the inventory bouncing around. So that will give you a sense of the stuff. Those are some of the most significant ones that we tried to adjust for. I think the other way that I got some comfort here and -- is that we did these direct sale channel checks at our businesses and our large distributors and saw somewhere a little above the mid-single-digit pickup there, too.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So the guidance for next year on the high single-digit on the commercial aftermarket corresponds to the pro forma growth or does that correspond to normalized?","W. Nicholas Howley","That is the number. That's the number we expect to see, okay? Carter, Carter, let me back up a minute. It is same-store sales basis. It's not GAAP, because GAAP number will always be bigger, right, before buying.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just going back to the aftermarket sales you just talked about. I'm understanding that there's a little bit of growth there if you look through some of the items that Nick just reviewed. But it does seem to suggest that even at the low growth rate you come up with there against the flat, the volumes were probably down for the year and for the quarter with offset, to some extent, by pricing. So I wanted to ask you, how we could look at the difference between volume decline or just relative volume performance between out of production models and in production models fares for those 2 groups?","W. Nicholas Howley","Rob, I don't know that I can tell you that. The real answer is I don't know the answer. But I don't know of anything unusually disproportionate between them.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But how would you characterize your relative exposure to the 2?","W. Nicholas Howley","Oh, our exposure -- in the out of production stuff you're talking about?","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, 737.","W. Nicholas Howley","737, 727, MD-80s, that kind of stuff, is that what you mean?","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That kind of thing.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. I mean, I haven't looked at that for about a year or so now, but I know the numbers that we -- that it was running were somewhere in the -- Greg, I want to say 3%, 4%, 5% of our aftermarket volume of [indiscernible] stuff.","Gregory Rufus","Yes, yes. That's high.","W. Nicholas Howley","I may be high on that. It's not a big number.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to ask -- and maybe we can go into more detail offline on that, but I wanted to also ask you about defense. So I think it's been better than expected the last couple of years.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And wondering, in your assumption for flat next year, don't you think you might see some negative catch up from [indiscernible] volumes this year?","W. Nicholas Howley","Are we clear -- Rob, that is clearly a risk. That's clearly a risk. I wouldn't tell you that's not a possibility.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well -- and then maybe we can fine-tune it a little bit. Have you worked through -- if sequester were to happen as written, since it's not in your number, what kind of guidance sensitivity is there to that?","W. Nicholas Howley","That's a very hard number. There's so many things bouncing all around. Rob, when we say a flat year-over-year, remember, there's price in there, right? So flat year-over-year means an absolute decline. So pick your number, but it's probably above inflation. So could you be down 10% rather than 4% units? If you told me that, I don't think I could argue with you. I wouldn't say I -- that doesn't appear to our operating units to be what they expect and at least, so far, from our bookings, we don't see it or we haven't seen the fourth quarter.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just, Greg, a clarification. If I look at your guidance and what you've said about the contribution of the acquisitions, is it fair to calculate you had about $80 million, $90 million in revenues in '13 from these 3 businesses and next year would be about the $200 million or a little higher? And so, about half of your -- what Nick said, about half of your revenue growth is from that and then the other $100 million something is...","W. Nicholas Howley","Right, yes. It's roughly half of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Greg, you mentioned about, I think it was $450 million in cash generation; and, Nick, you said about $1 billion. I would've thought it was a little bit higher than that by the end of next year, maybe around 1 1, is there any unusual movements in cash next year? It looks like you're forecasting about flat in line with this year.","Gregory Rufus","We'll, pay quite a bit more in cash taxes next year. This year, my cash taxes were about $82 million, which was extremely low versus my provision. Next year, my cash taxes are going to be more like $160 million. So you got to factor that as you're just looking at year-over-year. That might be one of the things that might help you, Dave.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, yes, that's probably it. Back on the defense side. Nick, how long is it carrying over or how much longer does that run? Does that benefit your numbers at all next year?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, it benefited some. We -- if we're lucky or hopefully, we can sell some more of it, but we booked about $18 million, I want to say $18 million of it and roughly half of it is shipped this year and half of it will ship next year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So X that, things you're forecasting a little bit worse than might be taking it face up?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes, yes. If you took that out, you'd be down a little more.","Gregory Rufus","Yes. And we're actively trying to roll that out to other governments and we have active negotiations that I don't want to get into the details with, with other governments on that product.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Nick, maybe any additional color, perspective on discussions with Boeing, Partnering for Success or royalties or any progress update with regard to that?","W. Nicholas Howley","I think, David, we've got to say the same thing we always said. We're not going to get into the details of a negotiation with our customer. It's an ongoing activity. I think we, along with many people around the industry, sort of -- probably the activity levels sped up a bit in the last quarter. But I don't know if our position is a heck of a lot different than it's in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner, Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just some questions on the M&A environment. You mentioned that there are more prospects right now on the defense side. Can you maybe give us a flavor for the difference in the purchase price? And also maybe you can discuss your tolerance for turning TransDigm into more of a defense company and what is the limit you're willing to go towards?","W. Nicholas Howley","We don't -- don't have any rule on that. What I said is we see more -- I didn't necessarily say there were more defense businesses than there were commercial. I said there were probably more defense businesses in our prospects than there typically are. Doesn't mean there's absolutely more than there are commercial. We evaluate defense businesses just like we evaluate commercial businesses. They -- in all likelihood, the revenue is -- the growth is going to be lower or declining, which means the price, we can't pay as much of a price. But we still have to see a private equity like we heard, which we see, say, is a 20% IRR our equity in the thing. But we look at them the same way. We don't have a rule for what percent of defense we go to, but, I mean, we have no intention of turning this into a primarily defense business.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one more. You mentioned that in the current interest rate environment, paying down debt is not very appealing and that makes sense. Where do interest rates need to go for you to think maybe this could take some leverage off and conservatize the balance sheet?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, I would -- first, I don't know the answer to that. It would be very dependent on what the situation with acquisitions and the like was at the time. Our first choice is always going to be to fund our existing businesses for the next accretive acquisitions. So that's a tough one to answer theoretically. But I would also say that our goal here is to give our shareholders over time private equity like returns, which we define is 15% to 20% return on their equity over time. We are not going to get that without staying in a reasonable leverage level.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Godyn, Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John Godyn here. I wanted to follow up on the last question on M&A. We've seen other acquisitive companies out there respond to what might be a little bit of a tougher aerospace deal environment by looking at verticals outside of A&D, oil and gas has come up. Is there any appetite for TransDigm to look outside of A&D for M&A?","W. Nicholas Howley","Not at this time. We think we got enough runway in front of us. If that turned out to be the case, then we'd have to decide. But we have other alternatives. One alternative is to open the aperture up a little on proprietary content and then you see many more things. That's not our desire nor our intention right now, just to be clear.","Gregory Rufus","But that's all within aerospace.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, but that's all within aerospace. The other alternative we frankly have, we always have, is to be more aggressive with our capital structure and more path. If we don't see enough to buy that meets our criteria. But our goal now hasn't changed. We want to buy proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And if I could ask one on aftermarket in general, how much capacity is there to sort of accelerate price growth to offset some of the volume weakness or some of the volume weakness that we're seeing price sensitivity among customers and then responding one way or another?","W. Nicholas Howley","No, it's just the -- I don't want to speak much to the price, what we might or might not do with the prices. But I -- there's not a lot of elasticity and demand here for the price. I mean, the stuff tends to be sole source.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Nick, I think on the last call you mentioned you had a survey done about what was going on the aftermarket and one of the things you called out was the Asian airlines have destocking and deferring. Have you seen that regional trend improve since then?","W. Nicholas Howley","I honestly can't say whether that's changed much in the last 90 days, I don't think it has. Clearly, the European airlines have gotten a little better. And I don't believe the situation has changed much in the Asian airlines on stocking, but I honestly can't say we took another set point in the last 90 days. I cannot say we have.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And maybe to follow up on the defense side of things. Obviously, the DOD has got some spending challenges at the moment. Are you seeing them being anymore strict on pricing or inventory levels or anything like that?","W. Nicholas Howley","We haven't yet. As I say, our defense is holding up better than we anticipated and at least, so far, the bookings are holding up, too. And we really haven't seen significant changes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert, Canaccord.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on the question regarding the aftermarket. When you talked about some of the work that you had, [indiscernible], a couple of quarters ago, you talked about the inventory issues in Europe and Asia as ideally in sort of the bucket of sort of onetime or near-term issues. It sounds like you haven't seen maybe much change on that front. Do you think -- to what extent do you think this is still sort of a near-term issue that gets corrected as volumes start to pick up again versus structurally, are you getting a sense that maybe there's some changes with your airline customers that are -- maybe you want to have a bigger impact perhaps than we've seen in prior cycles?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, what I don't -- in prior cycles, what has happened is eventually the, inventories snap back. So you got a year or 2 of very high growth. The most recent instance I want to say was probably 2011, after a bad year '09 and '10 it probably jumped up around the industry 20%. And then, obviously, that was a little bit of an overshoot, which we probably gave some back in '13. Different people -- I hear speculation that the airlines are getting better with their inventory control. And you may not see as much snapback, it may just more start to couple with underlying air travel. Obviously, you can see in our go-forward numbers, we are not planning on an inventory snapback. There is -- if there is one, that would be unusual, by the way, if there wasn't a snapback, that would say their airlines are getting better at managing their inventory. If there is, that's an upside to our forecast in the year.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And is it safe to say that the guidance implies maybe a strengthening commercial aftermarket as we go through the year? I mean, your commentary on the first quarter seemed to imply that maybe things strengthen as we go through the year. How do you see that cadence playing out?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, I think I specifically said, we expect the second half to be better than the first half. And the -- our first quarter of our year is always lower than the rest of the year and it has about 10% less days in it, in the quarter, our Q1. Our Q1 captures Christmas and Thanksgiving.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, okay. So most of the first quarter impact is, obviously, just a reduction in working days?","W. Nicholas Howley","Right. I mean, if you got -- and just what I -- the point I try to make and maybe I wasn't clear with it, if you got the same shipments in dollars from Q4 to Q1, effectively, you would have had a 10% pickup in shipments per day if that's clear.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli, KeyBanc.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Nick, I know you don't want to get too much into price, but just to get a sense here, Ray had a number of comments about the value creation, mentioned cost consolidation, headcount, but didn't mention price on any of those recently acquired businesses. Can we assume that price is still the same value creation lever it is, say, a couple of years ago?","W. Nicholas Howley","Nothing's changed in the businesses, the recent businesses we bought. We look at them the same way, we evaluate them the same way. They've got to have the same attributes and we got to see what I call a private equity like return, which means we have to change the margin.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then can you remind us, I mean, a couple of years back in your, I think it was in your Investor Day presentation, you used to call out some of the major platform exposure. Within the defense kind of market, should we still be thinking at Black Hawk, C-130, C-17 as your biggest programs or has that changed to some extent?","W. Nicholas Howley","You mean in aftermarket or production?","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I would say aftermarket or production. What do you think could have a bigger -- be the biggest variable? I mean, if we see Black Hawk OE units go down significantly, is that going to create a headwind? I mean, what's the most sensitive to revenues?","W. Nicholas Howley","We -- let me answer that this way. C-130 is still our biggest, by the way. In the aftermarket, it's pretty well spread. I would say, if I look at next year, in the OEM production rate, I don't think there's a whole lot of risk there. Those are -- we tend to be sole sourced, the things are pretty well locked for the next, what do we got now, 10.5 months or something is what you're looking out on. And the variation will come in the aftermarket. That's right, that's where the risk is.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And can we assume that, that would be more helicopter exposure aftermarket if readiness levels go down, would that be a factor?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, probably. As I think we've told you, roughly our defense business, in our defense aftermarket is something like 1\/3 transport, 1\/3 helicopter and 1\/3 other, which is mostly fighters.","Gregory Rufus","\\","Other odds and ends of things, too.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then last one, just a housekeeping. Greg, on the interest for next year, is that sort of annual interest expense you're looking at pretty fixed? I know you've got a portion the debt that floats. How much variability is there to that interest expense next year?","Gregory Rufus","I think '14 as the base, that there's a little bit, but most of it will get fixed toward the end of the calendar year of '14. So we're still guiding the floating rate.","Operator","At this time, I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your first speaker for today, Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. You have the floor, ma'am.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Andrew. Welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; Chief Operating Officer of our Power Group Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks and replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our Web site at transdigm.com. It should also be noted that our Form 10-K will be filed tomorrow and also will be found on our Web site.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investor section of our Web site or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advice you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA is defined for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share all of which are non-GAAP financial measures.","Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley","Good morning and thanks again to everybody for calling in.","Today I'll start off as always with some comments about our consistent strategy. I'll then overview a busy fiscal year 2016; I'll review the initial guidance for 2017. Kevin will then review some key operating items for 2016 and 2017 and Terry will run through the financials.","A fair amount to cover here today. To restate we believe our business model is unique in the industry both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle.","To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products. About three quarters of our sales come from products from which we believe we are the sole source provider. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from after market sales. After market revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.","Our longstanding goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant after market content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven value based operating methodology based on our three value driver concepts. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that is closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant after market content where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns and lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our effort to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation, to remind you, we basically have four our priorities are typically in the following order. One, invest in our existing businesses; second make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy, to state again these two are almost always our first choices; third, give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt. But given the low cost of debt especially after-tax this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions.","In the last three years you've seen three distinct business environments and corresponding real-life examples of how we manage our capital structure to best take advantage of the current business and capital market environment. In fiscal year 2014, with the acquisition opportunities not particularly compelling, we gave back about 1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of a large special dividend and some modest stock buyback. In fiscal year 2015, we saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates. We acquired about 1.6 billion worth of proprietary aerospace businesses that met our strategic and shareholder return requirements. In fiscal 2016, we again saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates that met our criteria.","As a result we acquired another 1.4 billion of aerospace businesses, in addition the combination of our usual high cash flow and continuing attractive credit markets allowed us to return about $1.6 billion more to our shareholders in the form of roughly 200 million of share buyback, plus a $1.4 billion special dividend paid out in early 2017.","To summarize, over the last three years, that is since the beginning of fiscal year 2014, we have returned about $3.2 billion to our shareholders. In that same period we made nine acquisitions for about $3.3 billion. We fully invested our existing business. We kept a healthy cash balance and maintained significant dry powder for additional acquisitions.","As we have done consistently in the past, depending on the specific business and capital market conditions we allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders. At 9\/30\/2016 based on the current capital market conditions and adjusting for the $1.4 billion special dividend and recent financing, we still have adequate capacity to make over $1 billion of additional acquisitions without issuing any equity. This capacity grows steadily to over $2 billion as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for fiscal year 2017.","Now, to summarize fiscal year 2016 year; 2016 was a busy year. In 2016 and early 2017, we raised about $3.8 billion. The proceeds were used primarily to fund acquisitions and to pay a special dividend. We were also able to modestly decrease our average interest rate as well as to refinance and extend maturities on certain existing debt. We acquired three businesses, as I mentioned, for about $1.4 billion. Breeze-Eastern, DDC and Young & Franklin. Kevin will talk a little more about each of these acquisitions.","We continued the integration of efforts of our various 2015 and 2016 acquisitions and most importantly we continued to generate real value in our new and existing business and we created substantial intrinsic value for our shareholders.","Now turning to the performance. To remind you this is the fourth quarter and full year summary for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Total GAAP revenues were up 8% versus the prior Q4 and 17% on a full year basis. Organic revenue was up about 2% on a full year basis. The Q4 organic growth was up slightly after normalizing for the one-month reporting delay in Telair 2015 reporting timing as we discussed in the previous calls.","Reviewing the revenues by market category, again on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q4 and the prior year full year, that is assuming we owned the same mix of businesses in both periods, in the commercial market, which makes up roughly 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were down 4% versus the prior Q4 and roughly flat on a full year basis. Commercial transport OEMs were up 2% on a full year basis and down slightly in Q4. We suspect we are seeing some system-wide inventory adjustments as wide body rate decreases ripple through the system.","Biz jet revenues continue to drop with revenues down 15% versus the prior year Q4 and about 10% down on a full year basis. This segment is small compared to commercial transport, but has been tougher than we expected all year. For the fiscal year, total commercial OEM bookings were about even with shipments.","Total commercial after market revenues versus the prior year were up 6.5% for both fiscal year 2016 and for Q4. For the full year, commercial transport after market revenues were up about 9.5%; however, this was partially offset by the softness in the business jet, helicopter and freighter after markets. Sequentially revenues were up modestly in the commercial after market. For the full fiscal year, total commercial after market bookings ran slightly ahead of shipments.","The defense markets which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for the year were modestly better than we anticipated. Fiscal year Q4 revenues are up 3% versus the prior year, full year revenues were up 2% versus the prior fiscal year. Full year defense bookings ran about 50 million behind shipments. This is almost entirely attributable to a few multi-year orders placed in 2015, specifically for the A400 cargo system, a few large international parachute orders and large order for the APKWS smart bomb system. In total, the rest of the defense bookings were roughly even with shipments.","In total for fiscal year 2016, excluding acquisitions, our revenues for commercial after market were just about as we originally expected. The commercial OEM business was a little lower and the military revenues were pretty close to our expectation at the start of the year. All-in all total revenues were close to our original expectations.","Moving now to profitability on a reported basis, again I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. The as defined adjustments in Q4 were non-cash compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortizations. Our EBITDA as defined of about $423 million for Q4 was up 17% versus the prior Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA as defined was roughly $1.5 billion or up 21% from the prior year. The EBITDA as defined margin was 47% of revenue for the full year and 48.5% for Q4. The full year EBITDA margins without dilution of the acquisitions purchased in 2015 and 2016 was approximately 49% or up 2.5 margin points versus fiscal year 2015 for the same mix of businesses we owned going into 2015 ","With respect to acquisitions we continue to actively look at opportunities. The pipeline of near term possibilities is reasonably active. Once again, closings are always difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on opportunities that meet our tight criteria. Now, moving on to 2017 guidance.","As we head into 2017, we again have concerns about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As you may recall at the start of fiscal year 2016, we reduced our headcount to get ahead of any potential softening. In retrospect, given the wide body softening and the weaker biz jet revenues I'm glad we did this, though we have not yet cut again for fiscal year 2017. We're cautious and we're ready to move quickly if necessary.","All-in all this is our best estimate for 2017 as you know we'll update this as the year proceeds. But based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions, our guidance are as follows; the mid-point of the fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance is $3.54 billion or up 12% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Organic growth is roughly 4% year-over-year. As in the past years with roughly 10% less working days in fiscal year 2017 Q1, revenues are anticipated to be lower than the other three quarters of fiscal year 2017, roughly in proportion to the lower working days. I'm not sure I made this point clear last year, so I'd ask you to keep in mind as you work through your outlooks.","The mid point of fiscal year 2017 EBITDA as defined is $1.68 billion or 47.5% of revenues that's up 13% year-over-year. We anticipate the EBITDA margins will move up throughout the year as we've seen in previous years. The base business that is excluding to 2016 acquisitions is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 48% or up or 48.5% or up one point versus 2016 for the same mix of businesses that we owned at the start of 2016.","The mid point of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be 11.98 per share that's up 4% versus the prior year. This is driven by a significant increase in core operating performance and recent acquisitions, offset in part by higher interest expense and a somewhat higher tax rate. Terry will review this in more detail.","On a pro forma or the same same-store basis I talked about before, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions. Commercial after market revenue growth in the mid to high single-digits, based on worldwide RPM growth in the 5% range. We're hopeful there could be some catch up upside here, but given the recent history we remain cautious until we see it.","Defense military revenue is estimated to be flat to slightly up as a percent of prior year given world events and the political uncertainty there could well be variations here. Commercial OEM growth we anticipate in the low to mid single-digit percentage range, primarily due to the 2017 and 2018 commercial transport production rates. We are cautious about 18 production rates and how this could reflect itself in the 2017 shipments. We are assuming a modest pick up of business jet revenues off a depressed fiscal year 2016.","Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in cash and almost $600 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2017. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.5x EBITDA at the end of 2017 or down a little over one-term. In summary, 2016 was a good and busy year. I'm confident with our consistent value focused strategy and strong mix of business we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors.","Now, let me hand this over to Kevin who will discuss some of the operating highlights of 2016 and a little about 2017.","Kevin Stein","Thanks Nick. Good morning, everyone.","As Nick mentioned in total we had a good fiscal year in 2016. I'll now take you through some of the most important operational highlights of the last few quarters. As we have stated previously we believe our business processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. As you will see we've made appreciable progress on each of these this past year.","First, let me provide an update on our acquisition related value driver. For review as we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes but is not limited to an implementation of our value creation process and metrics, restructuring the company into our product line focus groups including co-location of the team members to facilitate communication, focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business, and finally, we tighten up the cost control.","Since the beginning of fiscal year 2015, TransDigm has deployed over $3 billion of capital to acquire several value creation engines for the company. These include the businesses, or product lines acquired in fiscal year 2015 of Franke Aquarotter, Telair Cargo Group, Pexco Aerospace and PneuDraulics. And in fiscal year 2016, the acquisition of Breeze-Eastern Corporation, Data Device Corporation and most recently Young & Franklin and its subsidiary Tactair Fluid Controls.","Now to quickly update on our fiscal year 2015 activity. Franke Aquarotter a product line acquisition has now been relocated to our Adams Rite aerospace facility in Fullerton, California. After some initial start up issues, the product line and the manufacturing equipment have been successfully transferred. This business is similar to current Adams Rite [indiscernible] businesses and allows them to provide fluid control and accessories across all major large commercial aerospace OEM manufactures and all major commercial transport platforms. Finally, this business should approach TransDigm margins.","The Telair Cargo Group was split into three businesses along the similar lines as they had been divided under previous ownership. The cargo container company Nordisk Aviation Products is led by an internal promotion of Neal McKeever as the President and is located in Norway. Telair U.S. Cargo Systems is led by the incumbent President of that acquisition, Tim Dumbauld is based in Goldsboro, North Carolina and is largely responsible for the design and manufacturing of military cargo handling equipment for the Airbus A400M.","Finally, the largest segment Telair International headquartered in Miesbach, Germany is led by Marko Enderlein, a recent hire from the Satair Group, a division of Airbus and is responsible for the design and manufacturing of large commercial cargo handling systems. All of these businesses have been fully integrated into our culture and value generation strategy. Headcount reductions have been performed where warranted by business demand and opportunity. Value pricing opportunities have been slightly muted due to long-term agreements and our new product portfolio as limited after market demand at this stage in the product life cycle.","As stated previously we believe this combination of businesses will deliver on the expectations of our acquisition model for TransDigm, a solid business, but one that will be short of company average margins.","Pexco, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used around the aircraft. This business is led by Joe Glover, who is recently placed after the integration with TransDigm was completed. To-date we have been able to close the Huntington Beach manufacturing facility and combine all operations into Yakima. We reduced headcount in Yakima to align with our productivity targets; evaluated value based pricing opportunities and exited non-core production. We believe that this team will continue to perform at expectations and that significant value generation opportunities exist for the future. This business should run at or above the average EBITDA margins of TransDigm. ","PneuDraulics, a manufacturer of precision hydraulic components for the aerospace industry is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California. That acquisition, PneuDraulics had a strong management team and this allowed us to place Dain Miller a longtime PneuDraulics employee into the role as President. The integration of PneuDraulics has gone to plan and the Group has been an active participant in our culture, management, and business process training.","The company's performance has delivered on expectations for the three value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. We expect this business to deliver at the margin average of TransDigm.","Next, acquired on January 4, 2016, Breeze-Eastern, which is a leading global designer and manufacturer of high performance lifting and pulling devices for military and civilian aircraft has been integrated into the TransDigm culture, successfully implementing our value drivers and product line organization strategy. We have established an appropriate pricing structure by streamlining price lists and providing more value-added services to our after market offerings.","To help our productivity initiatives, we closed the standalone Virginia facility in September and centralized all engineering and product development at the main New Jersey location. This rationalization across the business has allowed a 23% headcount reduction at Breeze-Eastern since acquisition. The business has been reorganized around two main product lines, hoists and winches and our usual customer support team structure has been put in place with leaders established and team members physically relocated into dedicated work areas. This has allowed for an increased focus on new product development with a number of innovative new products under accelerated development which we expect to begin contributing to the growth of the business in 2017.","The overall results have met our expectations with revenue and EBITDA at or above our acquisition plan. With some existing LTAs and a few government [indiscernible] covered contracts this business probably doesn't quite get up to our average EBITDA margins.","Next we have Data Device Corporation, DDC, located in Bohemia, New York on Long Island which was acquired by TransDigm on June 23 of this year. DDC is the world leader in the design, manufacture of high reliability databus motion control and solid state power controller products for aerospace and defense vehicles. This capability allows them to deliver the smallest lightest and highest performing products in the most cost effective packaging for these applications in the aerospace market.","DDC consists of five global manufacturing locations and approximately 650 employees. To-date, we have aligned the DDC structure with TransDigm's operating strategy around a product line focused organization. Our product line structure has allowed us to quickly implement two product lines of databus and power, a 10% headcount reduction to better align organization size and cost structure, review of pricing and contractual opportunities and new product initiatives. Although only four months under TransDigm, the DDC team and business has delivered value as expected for TransDigm shareholders, with revenue and EBITDA slightly ahead of expectations. We anticipate this business will be able to deliver EBITDA margins at or in excess of TransDigm averages.","Now, acquired on September 16, the Liverpool, New York based Young & Franklin and the subsidiary Tactair Fluid Controls are the latest additions to the TransDigm team. They manufacture highly engineered valves and actuators at our almost all of their products are proprietary. With about 70% of revenues coming from the aerospace industry, the remaining 30% comes from the industrial gas turbine markets.","Given the recent nature of the acquisition it is too early to comment on the outcome of all of our value driven initiatives. Productivity and enhanced new business initiatives are all being actively investigated and we will update on these as they come into focus. Additionally, a thorough top to bottom review of all contracts, purchase orders and forecasts has been done to evaluate any value-based pricing reset opportunities; however product line teams have been formed around the IGT and aerospace market segments and these teams have now been trained in our culture, methods and expectations.","We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will live up to model expectations. Although numerous margin expansion opportunities have been identified, we expect this business to achieve margins just under the average for TransDigm.","To update the recent progress on our new business value driver let me bring your attention to several recent developments in our aerospace market. Our Telair U.S. Cargo Group business was able to overcome a difficult engineering challenge on the Airbus A400M cargo loading system. Telair recently upgraded the design of their highly engineered cargo lockdown mechanism which holds containers in place during flight. The retrofit program is a one-time upgrade to this restraint system that will allow the containers to be held in place in flight and is also certified to release during an air drop.","Going forward this new design will become part of the OEM package sold to Airbus and we anticipate normal defense after market demand for maintenance of this critical cargo handling system.","The Adel Wiggins Group which has pioneered technology and lightning protection for over 20 years in design, testing and manufacturing of dielectric fuel and hydraulic lightning isolators for the aerospace market was awarded the fuel and hydraulic system lightning isolators for the Boeing 777x, and the Bombardier Global 7,000-8,000 program. The safety oriented product is put in place to protect the fuel tank in case of a lightning strike.","For Airbus and their A320 platform, a few key design wins have recently occurred. Hartwell Corporation recently designed and upgraded engine nozzle latch for the A320 CEO or Current Engine Option. This retrofit program is covered by an EASA Airworthiness Directive requiring airlines to make this upgrade.","This new patent pending locking mechanism is designed to prevent the nozzle from being in an unlocked condition after maintenance. And for the A320 Neo, or the latest new engine option, Marathon Norco, was just awarded a newly designed fan cowl hold open device for this platform. These awards add to the considerable number of design wins that we have already received for the latest new platforms of A350, A320 Neo, 737 Max, and 777x across all of our business segments.","Innovation is clearly a focus of our shareholder value, generation culture and value driver strategy. We continue to invest fully in our businesses from legacy through recent acquisitions of the TransDigm family. To allow the development of new products and technologies for both the OEM and after market segments. This has allowed TransDigm to once again be named to the Forbes most innovative companies list in the world. This award identifies TransDigm as one of the Top 100 global companies in innovation and the only European or American aerospace company so recognized.","Now, let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Terry Paradie","Thank you, Kevin.","Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal year 2017.","Fourth quarter net sales were $875 million up $65 million or approximately 8% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions, PneuDraulics, Breeze-Eastern and DDC contributed $89 million of additional sales for the period offset by a slight decrease in organic sales. The decrease in organic sales was primarily driven by declines in commercial OEM and defense markets, offset by slight growth in commercial after market sales. The organic growth was also negatively impacted due to the prior period including four months of Telair due to a reporting lag as we previously discussed.","Our fourth quarter gross profit was $484 million or 55.3% of sales. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.3% was 2.5 margin points higher than the prior year. Excluding all acquisition related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved about three margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure and favorable product mix.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12.1% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock compensation, SG&A was 10.3% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago.","We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $27 million versus the prior year quarter due to the increase to outstanding borrowings. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the financing completed during our fiscal third quarter. As part of the financing, we borrowed an incremental $1.9 billion of which the proceeds were used to primarily fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes including the partially fund the $24 per share special dividend paid on November 1.","Our GAAP effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter compared to 29.1% in the prior year. During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and are now recognizing the income tax provision on the income statement. As a result, our effective tax rate generally approximates our cash tax rate.","Our full year GAAP effective tax rate was 23.7% compared to 29.8% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the current year was primarily due to the accounting standard change. Excluding the accounting standard change, our 2016 effective tax rate is 29%, the same rate that we use for our full year adjusted EPS.","Our net income for the quarter increased $13 million or 9% to $155 million, which is 17.7% of sales. This compares to net income of $142 million or 17.5% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales versus prior period, improvements to our operating margin and lower effective tax rate partially offset by higher interest expense.","GAAP EPS was $2.70 per share in the current quarter compared to $2.50 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $3.29 per share an increase of 60% compared to the $2.83 per share last year. Please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Since this is our fiscal year end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some significant items. Net sales increased $464 million or by 17% to end our year at almost $3.2 billion in revenues. Acquisitions contributed $409 million of the increase in sales; organic sales were 2% above the prior year.","Reported gross profit increased 19% to $1.73 billion and was 54.5% of sales compared to 53.6% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition activity and stock compensation expense, our full year margin versus prior year improved over two margin points.","Selling and administrative expenses of 12.1% of sales in fiscal year 2015 is slightly higher than the 11.9% sales, excuse me, in fiscal year 2016 slightly ahead of 11.9% sales in fiscal year 2015. Again excluding all acquisition related expenses, stock compensation and non-operating expenses, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales last year.","Net interest expense increased $65 million due to the increase in weighted average outstanding borrowings to $8.8 billion from $7.8 billion last year. Our fiscal year 2016 weighted average cash interest rate was 5.3%. Adjusted EPS was $11.49 per share this year up 28% from the $9.01 per share a year ago.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity. The company generated $668 million of cash from operating activities and we closed the year with $1.59 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company's gross debt leverage ratio at September30, 2016 was approximately 6.5x a pro forma EBITDA and 5.5x pro forma EBITDA on a net basis. Adjusting for the dividend and financing that occurred subsequent to our fiscal year end, our net debt to EBITDA leverage would have been 6.4x on a pro forma basis. We believe fiscal year 2016 was another great year for TransDigm and our shareholders.","As we look forward to fiscal year 2017, we estimate the mid-point of our GAAP EPS to be $8.65 and as Nick previously mentioned we estimate the mid-point of our adjusted EPS to be $11.98.","As we've disclosed on Slide 9, there's $3.33 in adjustments to bridge GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. Nick provided color on fiscal year 2017 sales and EBITDA as defined. As a result of the recent acquisition activity, refinancing and dividend, I'm going to walk through the cost below.","EBITDA as defined and explained why adjusted net income per share increase is 4% despite EBITDA as defined growing 13%. Old percentages assume the mid-point of the guidance, so appreciation and amortization excluding backlog amortization of approximately $25 million is expected to be $121 million compared to $102 million in fiscal year 2016 an increase of 19%.","Interest expense is also expected to increase about 20% to around $580 million in fiscal year 2017. This estimate reflects the latest financing just completed in October and includes both cash and interest and approximately $20 million of amortization of debt issuance cost. Also in the forecast assumes average LIBOR increase to 1% for the full year.","We also expect $33 million in refinancing fees. Our effective tax rate for both GAAP and adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2017 is expected to be around 31%. The benefit from fiscal year 2017 stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments will be recorded as the street adjustments throughout the quarters and we reduced our GAAP tax rate along with our cash taxes.","We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will increase slightly and be approximately 56.5 million shares. As a result of these items, our adjusted EPS of 11.98 is approximately 4% greater than fiscal year 2016.","Finally, with regards to our liquidity and leverage after paying a special dividend assuming no additional acquisition or capital market transactions we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of cash on hand at the end of fiscal year 2017. This includes an estimate of CapEx of 85.9 or approximately 2.4 percent of sales.","Again, as Nick mentioned, assuming no other acquisition activity our net leverage will be around 5.5x, our EBITDA as defined at September 30, 2017, we're delevering almost one full term.","I will hand it over to Liza to kick-off the Q&A session at this time.","Liza Sabol","Thanks Terry. Operator we are now ready to open the lines. I do ask that you limit your questions to two per person and reinsert yourself into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Nick, first question\u2026","Nick Howley","And welcome back by the way.","Robert Stallard","Oh, thanks so much, appreciate it. My first question for you is on debt. Very simply do you think we've seen the peak in the debt market here? You mentioned you expect LIBOR rates to go up going forward, so you seize the opportunity as much as you can?","Nick Howley","You mean in the past or going forward just to be clear on your question?","Robert Stallard","Going forward.","Nick Howley","I'm very hesitant to forecast that. One thing I've sort of learned at least for me that I'm not very good at predicting the directions to the capital market. We would -- I would expect that the rates might start to move up, but I have to say, we've been consistently wrong on that for the last three to four years. We used a little higher rate here primarily to be conservative not that we have any particular insight in that, Rob. I think realistically, what we will do is, we'll assess it quarter-by-quarter as we go forward.","Robert Stallard","Yes. And then as a follow-up, on the business, on the aerospace after market, are you seeing any of these larger industry trends changing, we've talked about destocking and inventories being brought down, I think like that do you see any improvement there?","Nick Howley","I'd like to see, Rob, it's hard to put an actual number on it. But I would say in the commercial transport for the year, you know our commercial transport which is the biggest slug of it, was up a little over 9%. I think that is getting closer to reflecting the consumption rate though maybe not quite there yet, but it hasn't -- it hasn't -- it doesn't reflect any snapback, which frequently happens after you have a couple of years that don't quite reflect the consumption. I think that's probably about the best I can add to it.","Robert Stallard","Yes. That's great. Thanks for the update.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","David Strauss","Good morning. Given that you have a fair amount of floating rate debt I know you've assumed 100 basis point increase, Nick. But can you, maybe Terry, can you remind us of -- I think you have some caps in place on your floating rate debt if we do see higher rates?","TerryParadie","Yes. David I think we ended the year in compliance to -- we're essentially above 75% fixed. We're currently looking as a result of our most recent financing looking at other options to hedge that with their cap or a swap to essentially get us back to that 75% fixed rate.","David Strauss","Okay. Yes, exactly. Just where the portion that appears this is floating, but is actually capped where that is and maybe some detail around that?","Nick Howley","Yes. As we've disclosed we have essentially a hedge -- we have a cap in there around 2.4%. And then we also have another swap up there that has cap at 2.8%. So you have around 150 or 175 basis points, if you will of room within that collar of those swaps you have in place.","David Strauss","Got it, okay. And then on cash flow, could you maybe, it looks like you came in pretty close this year, but maybe a little bit light to what you were guiding for year-end cash balance kind of normalizing for the acquisition, you did at the end of the year. Could you maybe just touch on that if anything moved around?","And then, it looks like you're anticipating a pretty good year for free cash flow next year, maybe some of the moving pieces there working capital and cash taxes what you're assuming there? Thanks.","Nick Howley","I'm talking about 2016. 2016 essentially the receivables when you sort it all out the receivables were a little higher at the end of the year, which is kind of just the timing of how much stuff shipped in August versus September. That's the significant movement.","Terry Paradie","As moving into 2017, I think the key assumption there is around the cash taxes. As we've said, on some of my prepared comments, we expect before discrete our effective tax rate to be around 31% this year and with the new accounting change most of the stock option exercises reduced your cash tax rate down to the lower amount, so now that that's in your provision, we expect our cash tax rate to be slightly below or at that 31% going forward.","David Strauss","Thanks guys.","Nick Howley","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Hey, just as a follow-up to that, what do you guys expect to generate in free cash flow in fiscal 2017?","Nick Howley","Well, I think we gave the number, right? We told you between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion is where we expect the cash to be at the end of the year.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Terry Paradie","Our EBITDA as defined number and still in that ratio of around 50% cash turn you can figure out what the free cash flow would be in our CapEx number.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Nick Howley","I'd do something again. Take the EBITDA in the range of 50% turns into cash and hopefully a little higher.","Noah Poponak","Yes. So that conversion has been a little light it sounds like you're saying that's sort of timing of working capital versus being something else?","Terry Paradie","Yes. I think as Nick talked about a little bit earlier receivables were up a little this year, but purely on a timing standpoint and I think we talk about EBITDA as defined, we turn 50% of that into cash and that's sort of our metric for free cash flow and we don't see anything unusual there.","Noah Poponak","Has there been any change in any terms of trade if you will, with any customers that has impacted working capital?","Nick Howley","I don't think materially, as you probably know, Boeing is pushing around the industry to extend the terms up to 90 days. I don't think that has materially impacted our number. Maybe that's moved around through the industry maybe it's moved to one day or something, but I don't think its material impact.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And then Nick, you've expressed some caution on the large commercial original equipment supply\/demand picture for a few quarters now, but this is the first time I've heard you specifically say that you were cautious on 2018 production rates. Could you maybe just elaborate a little on why you're saying that?","Nick Howley","Yes. I'd say the same as usual. The cycle seems long enough to me. You are starting to see I would say probably more sort of negative comments, some positive comments and the 18 cycle, the shipments in 18 will start to reflect back on our 2017 shipments in the back half of the year. So people start to tweak that, it will reflect into 2017. That's what I was trying to -- the point I was trying to make. So we're cautious.","Noah Poponak","Do you have a working view on rate of change in 2018 production rates versus 2017?","Nick Howley","I don't recall. I think, I don't remember, but let me not speculate. We are concerned that -- we're concerned that the back end of it could soften and reflect back into 2017 and that's why our [indiscernible] OEM pick up isn't larger. I don't remember the exact rate and I don't want to stab at it.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. You spoke a little bit about wins that you had on the 777x. I wonder if you could talk about your total level of content on that plane relative to the current generation of 777 and where you think it's going to end up.","Nick Howley","Yes. We don't disclose the content by plane, but we think the 777x, as we sit here today will very likely end up somewhere around the same content. We don't expect a lot of change.","Seth Seifman","Okay. And then, just as a quick follow-up, within the pro forma guidance for defense, where does DDC fit in relative to that? I think it's flat to slightly up, right?","Nick Howley","The total is flat to slightly up.","Seth Seifman","How does DDC fit in there?","Nick Howley","We don't break it out by operating unit. We're happy with the DDC acquisition is doing well.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi. Good morning guys.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Can I just clarify one item on the free cash flow? You estimate about $850 million and I have cash taxes sort of offsetting the increase in CapEx. Is the $200 million improvement year-over-year primarily working capital?","Nick Howley","I'm not sure exactly how you're coming up with that number. What I'd do is take the 50% of EBITDA you saw our CapEx number around $84 million, $85 million and use the 31% initially as your cash tax rate and that should get you sort of in that free cash flow range that we are talking about and we guided $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay. And then, I guess maybe Nick or Kevin, just -- is there I appreciate the qualitative comments on the new wins. Is there any way you could guide us more quantitatively percentage of new wins or percentage for full year 2016?","Nick Howley","You broke up.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Is there any quantitative way you could talk about the new program wins as a percentage of total bids or whatever metrics you guys look at it internally?","Nick Howley","Yes. I don't have a good number for that. I would say on the -- as I think we told you before, the content picks up pretty well in the 787. The content is pretty good on the -- picks up nicely on the A350. I would expect the 777, the A320 Neo, and the 737 Max and that have a lot of change in their content. Boeing and Airbus' goal was to not make substantive changes in them so you wouldn't expect to see a lot of change.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Your line is open.","Ken Herbert","Hi. Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Ken Herbert","I just wanted to dig into the commercial after market, if I could. When do you, you obviously another quarter where you had a 3% headwind from business jets helicopters and it sounds like cargo in the fourth quarter. When do those, when do you anniversary those more or the comps maybe get easier for that part of the business and does the guidance and what does the guidance imply for commercial transport growth versus these other markets in 2017, which seem to clearly have been about a significant headwind in the last few quarters?","Nick Howley","Yes. I mean the commercial transport growth if you look at mid to high single-digit next year, the commercial transport growth we would expect be higher, if you think the business was higher than the average, same thing. If you take the business jet and I suspect the freighter, they will be a little bit of a down drag so take whatever number you want to use from mid to high single digits the commercial transport is probably on the upper end of that point and the others are down on the lower end.","Ken Herbert","Okay. So there's no specific inflection point maybe after the second quarter when you start to see the comps get easier for the non-transport side of the business?","Nick Howley","I don't think so. I mean, I think that it's going to change versus the intrinsic demand, not just [indiscernible].","Ken Herbert","Okay. And then, if I could geographically, have you seen any change in the last few quarters or in the outlook in 2017 on the after market in terms of, I know it sounds like we've had really good demand in Asia in your fiscal 2016, do you assume maybe a little slower growth there and pick up in Europe or North America or anything you could comment on geographically?","Nick Howley","Yes. I would say you can almost generally go through and we do it unit by unit, product line by product line. So it bounces around, but the way I would think about it is almost take the growth in RPMs by region of the world and that will give you some pretty good idea.","Ken Herbert","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. Nick, or maybe Terry, could you clarify the net cash flow impact of the dividend less the incremental leverage being taken on in 2017? I know you gave the cash year-end number but just that moving part would be helpful.","Nick Howley","I think that it would be, I'm just doing here, its $650 million or 700 million.","Myles Walton","Okay.","Terry Paradie","We can get back into the free cash flow. But without it, it's a little tougher.","Nick Howley","Yes.","Myles Walton","Okay. And then the other question, Nick, you talked about bookings are tracking slightly ahead, excuse me orders tracking slightly ahead of bookings in after market in the quarter. Any way to clarify if that's an acceleration or a continuation of a trend just commentary in the after market in general near term, is it similar to what you saw last quarter dispositioning into the next year\u2026?","Nick Howley","Well, the after market shipments -- the shipments were sequentially up and the bookings I don't -- I just don't have a good -- I'd say the same -- I can't say they are noticeably separated. They are roughly close on the year and I think the fourth quarter isn't much different.","Myles Walton","Okay. And then, the last one, the CapEx implied doubling year-on-year is that just conservatism on the CapEx budget?","Nick Howley","I suspect that's a high number. We under spent against our budget the previous year and I expect that's a little high.","Myles Walton","Okay. All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","JoseCaiado","Good morning. This is actually Joe on for Rob.","Nick Howley","Okay.","JoseCaiado","Nick, given the $1 billion to $2 billion in potential dry powder by year-end and any updated covenants under your latest debt structure what's your restricted payment capacity for the coming year assuming no M&A?","Nick Howley","Restricted payment is off to 7.25 net on -- and 4.25 on secured debt capacity and then for new debt, plus the including the target of that.","Terry Paradie","Are you after how much dividend can we pay out that's what you are after?","JoseCaiado","Essentially yes.","Terry Paradie","At this point in time we only have about 130 million remaining through the end of the year and we would have to get an amendment to do an additional dividend which by the way just almost every time we do this, you have to get an amendment.","Nick Howley","Or the other point is if we get under six times net debt we can pay a dividend for that six times.","JoseCaiado","Okay, understood. And then, just you already cut headcount to get ahead of that potential softening in commercial OE. You said you'd adjust again if necessary, you talked about how you're cautious on 18 production rates, what has to happen for you to adjust further and what would you need to see to do that?","Nick Howley","Oh, I think it would be -- it's hard to say exactly what the point is when your concern gets to that. It's a little bit of an art rather than a science. But clearly starting to see more announcement of turn down of rates in either predictions of turn downs in 2018 or even the beginning of 2019 would do it.","Now sometimes you don't see the announcements. No one announces it, but you'll all of a sudden see the orders are starting to slowdown that's another thing that would do it. And we'll just watch those as the year goes. You were quite -- we're prepared and as we've done in the past we'll move quick to stay out ahead of this.","JoseCaiado","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful Nick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. Thanks Nick. How are you doing? When you say 80% of your sales comes from sole source as far as you believe, why do you add that caveat? I don't want to over wordsmith your word choice, but what percent of that 80% sole source do you know is sole sourced, what I'm trying to do is get a sense for the barriers around the 80%?","Nick Howley","I think that is materially very close. I mean, why we hedge a little bit, there is no guarantee that someone makes a change they send us an e-mail and tell us they changed it, but we have a pretty good beat on it.","Hunter Keay","All right. So the vast majority of it?","Nick Howley","Yes.","Hunter Keay","Got it. And then, you mentioned Boeing kind of pushing people around a little bit. Are you getting pressure from them or any other OEs to roll up the contracts into maybe not one single contract, but certainly fewer contracts like we've seen from a couple other OE suppliers?","Nick Howley","Like everyone in the industry, Boeing has been pressing what they call as partnership for success which is the least to roll into less contracts, I would say and we ended up about two or three years ago with sort of modified version of that where the terms and conditions we agreed to generically and the rest of it is more product by product focus.","Hunter Keay","So, would you say that's largely behind you at this point or is that still kind of ongoing?","Nick Howley","I don't know. It was behind us two years ago but the contract runs for five years, or maybe it was -- was it three years ago or two years ago? I can't remember now. The contract runs for five years, so you'll reengage again a couple years before the contract runs out.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thanks Nick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks and good morning or good afternoon, I guess now. Couple questions. First, to follow-up on the last one, have you see I ask this every quarter, sorry, but has there been anymore evidence of more second sourcing type incursion in your product line up or are you seeing evidence of that?","Nick Howley","No, we have not. We have not. As always we hear talk about periodically, but we haven't seen any significant activity. At least for any of the proprietary a very small percent of our business is non-proprietary and that part of it you'll see it. It's not unusual.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And then, I just wonder what can you do to guard against that. I know you owned some of the IP, and what have you but what other strategies do you have in place?","Nick Howley","Primarily we own the IP and it is a very expensive switching process. It's long and expensive. I mean the main way you protect yourself is deliver quality product, deliver it on time, and service the heck out of the account and fix it fast if something comes up because the math rarely works because of the switching cost.","Gautam Khanna","Makes sense. Wanted to get your high level view if there's any upside or downside with the new administration to your business, I mean how could you be benefited at all, if at all?","Nick Howley","I doubt first I have no idea but that's not going to stop me from saying something, I'm leading into that, I have no idea, but I'd be surprised if it has an impact on worldwide revenue passenger miles, but I guess you might see more defense spending perhaps, but I have no way to know how to handicap that at this point.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And then, one last one, you mentioned a reasonably active M&A pipeline. In this -- in the pipeline today, are there any larger opportunities kind of needle moving opportunities or are they more of the under $100 million of revenue size any characterization?","Nick Howley","I would say they were small to mid to large, but I'd also say that's almost always the case. The bigger ones tend to somebody decides to sell them and they come up and you've got to move pretty quick on them. I'd say the backlog doesn't look a lot different than it often looks.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And the profile is similar, high after market, high proprietary et cetera? You aren't seeing that?","Nick Howley","Well, when I say the backlog of things we're looking at, if it's not proprietary, it doesn't a reasonable amount of after market, it's not in our backlog.","Gautam Khanna","Got it. All right. Thank you guys.","Nick Howley","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak","Hi, guys just had one follow-up. In the defense segment you mentioned a few programs that I believe you said were order rate headwinds in 2016 versus 2015. I guess those are there for revenue growth headwinds in 2017, is that true and can you quantify that, it would be great to just understand how much the segment is growing for you excluding those program specific headwinds.","Nick Howley","Well, yes, Noah what I was trying to point out there is, the bookings ran behind the revenue this year 2016. So what I was trying to point out is that I don't think that's indicative of 2017 because there were a few big orders placed in 2015 that were multi-year orders. So they don't repeat each year, they repeat every other year -- every third year, something like that. I don't know if that's clear or not. That's what I was trying to point out what the rationale was for the booking probably behind. I think -- go ahead, sorry.","Noah Poponak","Are any of those revenue headwinds in 2017 that then don't repeat beyond 2017 or is it more that they are long cycle programs with lumpy order patterns?","Nick Howley","It's more like the long cycle programs. I would say the only one that I would say that could as you sort of pay your money and take your choice on what theA400 shipping rate is going to be. That was one of them and there could well be up or down adjustments for that as it's been kind of running in fits and starts.","Noah Poponak","I guess it sort of begs question then I little bit more broadly on the end market. Is there anything holding that up from reaccelerating a little faster just given what we're seeing with the budget and what we're seeing some other defense companies project for growth next year?","Nick Howley","If the question is could it be higher? Yes, it surely could and I would hope it would be. But, we sort of have to take our best estimate based on what we get out of the product teams, what we see in our incoming booking rates and forecast it out. Now, I would doubt we would be very far off on the OEM programs, but what could easily move up or down, I would hope up not down is the after market. If you get more active or you just decide to restock those things can move pretty quickly.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I'm seeing no other questioners in the queue at this time. So, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, again, for calling into our call this morning and please look for our 10-K that will be filed tomorrow.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, again, for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's program Liza Sabol, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Liza Sabol","Thank you and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. Presenting this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.","Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that statements made during this call which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","We'd also like to advise you that during the course of the call we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically as defined, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliation.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley","Good morning and thanks again for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start off with some summary comments on our consistent strategy; a few comments on the operating performance and outlook and capital allocation, and then Kevin and Mike will expand and give more color.","To reiterate, we're unique in the industry due to both our consistency and our ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and about three quarters of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues which typically have significantly higher margins and provide relative stability in the downturns.","Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as the careful allocation of our capital.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically, one we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content; second, we utilize a simple well proven value-based operating methodology; third, we have a very decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with our shareholders; fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to clear path to PE like returns; and lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a significant portion of our value creation methodology.","As you saw from our press release, we are off to a good start in fiscal year 2020 with solid operating performance in the quarter. Revenues and EBITDA as defined are up substantially. Of course, much of this is due to the Esterline acquisition, but organic revenue growth was also up nicely. EBITDA margins were margins were up versus the prior year as both the TransDigm base legacy and the acquired businesses all performed well. We continue to generate real intrinsic value for our investors.","Far and away the largest portion of our revenue, our worldwide commercial aerospace revenue was up about 9% in Q1 versus the prior year, driven primarily by a very strong commercial aftermarket growth. Our smaller worldwide defense revenue was also up. Defense bookings were down a little, but defense bookings can be lumpy. At this time, fiscal year 2020 continues to look like a good year for TransDigm though we see possible clouds on the horizon. The commercial aftermarket was quite strong in Q1. However, given the uncertainty around the 737 program production rates, possible attendant inventory ripples and uncertainty in China related travel, we are leaving our full year guidance unchanged. We have begun to trim our cost. However, this is a little more difficult than usual given the uncertainty in the 737 timing. We're watching this closely and are prepared to react more quickly if required.","To put the 737 MAX OE production program into perspective for TransDigm at full production rate, it makes up somewhere between 3% and 4% of our revenue and a smaller percent of our EBITDA. Kevin will discuss the quarter and the year in more detail.","With respect to M&A and capital allocation in the last six months, we closed and received payment on the sale of both the Souriau business for about $920 million and our EIT group of businesses for about $190 million. As I said last quarter, we may still sell some smaller businesses with less proprietary aerospace and aftermarket content. If we do so, as of today I don't expect that there would be significant in size.","With respect to capital allocation in the last six months, we paid both a $30 per share special dividend and a $32.50 per share special dividend. The combined special dividends of $62.50 per share or about $3.5 billion is roughly 12.5% of the equity value at the start of fiscal year 2020. This is a pretty substantial payout.","Due to the divestitures combined with solid cash generation from our operating businesses, we're able to make these payments to our shareholders and still maintain substantial liquidity and firepower. As usual, we will review our go-forward capital allocation over the balance of the year and see where we stand towards the end of the year.","We now expect to have over $3 billion of cash at the end of fiscal year 2020. We also have significant additional borrowing capacity under our credit line and our credit agreement. We have the financial flexibility and capital market access to deal with any currently anticipated capital requirements, allocations or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.","We continue to actively evaluate and seek M&A opportunities. We have a decent pipeline. As usual mostly in the small to mid-range, I can't predict or comment on any possible closings but as I said before we're still working steadily in M&A and are open for business.","And now let me hand this over to Kevin to review our 2020 performance outlook and some other items. ","Kevin Stein","Thanks Nick. Today I'll review our results by key market then discuss the profitability of the business for the quarter. I'll also comment on the fiscal year guidance and review some other operational items.","As you have seen, we had a strong first quarter and a good start to the year. Mike will provide more details on the financials, but our first quarter operations, specifically, revenue and EBITDA, as defined, were up substantially over last year due in part to good organic growth, as well as continued acquisition integration and performance. Q1 GAAP revenues were up approximately 48% versus prior year Q1 and EBITDA, as defined, was up 40% versus the prior year, with margins approaching 47% of revenue.","Now, we will review our revenue by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2019. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. Please note that beginning this quarter, this market analysis discussion now includes the results of the former Esterline businesses.","In the commercial market, which makes up close to 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM market revenue increased approximately 1% in Q1 when compared with Q1 of fiscal year 2019. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the majority of our commercial OEM business, were flat versus prior year Q1. However, bookings solidly outpaced Q1 sales in the current period by more than 15%.","We did see minimal headwind from the impact of 737 MAX production halt this quarter. However, we believe any currently anticipated impact from the MAX issues should not have a material impact on our EBITDA for the full fiscal year. We are very diversified across all platforms worldwide, so the impact of the 737 MAX or any single program should not be material to TransDigm in the aggregate.","Aside from isolated issues with a few aerospace platforms, general industry consensus remains mostly favorable long term, as significant OEM backlog remains across the industry. We are currently assessing the near-term impact of the 737 MAX rate reduction, as well as smaller cuts in production for other Boeing, Airbus and business jet platforms.","As a result of the recent production rate changes and other evolving global concerns, we are implementing a necessary 3% to 10% reduction in direct and indirect headcount, the impact of which will be felt in the second half of the year and will certainly vary by business unit.","Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by 17% over the prior year quarter, with the commercial transport passenger market outperforming our expectations. In the quarter, growth in the commercial transport passenger and business jet markets were significantly offset by very modest declines in the commercial transport freight and commercial transport interior markets.","Overall, commercial transport fundamentals continue to remain relatively strong, although a few items still bear watching. Global revenue passenger growth continues to decelerate, albeit growth is still near the long-term average. This might be impacted by weaker economic activity and multiple geopolitical disruptions worldwide.","Cargo demand is weaker, as FTKs have declined from reaching an all-time high in 2017 and business jet utilization data is pointing to stagnant growth that could create a headwind for the business jet aftermarket. Finally, it is unclear how the 737 MAX situation has or will impact our commercial aftermarket, but it may prove to be a net positive for TransDigm, as older aircraft are utilized more.","Now let me speak about our defense market, which is just over 30% of our total revenue. The defense market, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues was up approximately 9% over the prior year Q1. As a reminder, we are lapping tougher prior year comparisons, as our defense revenue accelerated in most of fiscal 2019. Defense bookings declined slightly in the quarter driven by robust defense OEM bookings growth and a not unexpected decline in defense aftermarket bookings given the recent restocking pace.","Now moving to profitability. I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. EBITDA as defined of about $681 million for Q1 was up 40% versus prior Q1. EBITDA as defined margin in the quarter of 46.5% was negatively impacted by acquisition dilution from Esterline. Excluding Esterline, margins in our legacy business were over 51% and improved both sequentially as well as over the prior year quarter.","Margin improvement progress is always important to us and indicates that our base business continues to drive and find opportunities for improvement by using our value drivers. On Esterline we are now over 10 months post close. The integration continues to progress. To date, the acquisition is exceeding our expectations for growth in this largest of TransDigm acquisitions. As we have stated in the past, we will now no longer refer to any Esterline-specific metrics as these businesses have now become part of the fabric of TransDigm.","Moving now to the 2020 guidance, also found on Slide 7 in the presentation. We are not changing our full year revenue EBITDA or adjusted EPS guidance at this time, although we saw a strong first quarter results. General market conditions have not meaningfully changed with the exception of the 737 MAX grounding and production halt. This is an evolving situation that could make it challenging for us to achieve the high end of our previously issued revenue guidance.","However as previously mentioned, we believe any impact from the MAX issues should not be material to our EBITDA this fiscal year. There's also a potential upside for us in the commercial aftermarket resulting in the 737 MAX issues as older aircraft may be utilized more.","We will continue to closely monitor the 737 MAX situation and the expected impact on our business to be prepared to react as necessary including any further preemptive steps that might be warranted. After consideration of these items at this time, we are not adjusting our full year revenue and EBITDA guidance, as we still expect them to fall within the range previously issued. We will update again as this situation crystallizes.","In addition we are not changing our original market growth assumptions at this time. We do however realize there could be some shifting between commercial OEM and aftermarket growth rates but it is just too close to call with only one quarter of data.","I would also like to caution that although our EBITDA margin was strong in the first quarter, margins can be lumpy and margins may fluctuate over the next few quarters. So let me conclude by stating that Q1 of fiscal 2020 was another good quarter for TransDigm. We continue to be very pleased with the Esterline acquisition integration as well as the strong operational performance in the quarter from our legacy businesses. We look forward to the remainder of 2020 and expect that our consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you have come to expect from us.","With that I would now like to turn it over to our CFO, Mike Lisman.","Mike Lisman","Good morning, everyone. I'm going to very quickly elaborate on some of the financial results that Kevin just discussed. As a reminder and as mentioned on our last earnings call, the Esterline organization is it used to exist including the corporate office is for the most part now gone with the business units which used to comprise Esterline reporting independently into TransDigm. We're therefore not planning to give too much specific color or details around Esterline's performance separate from that of legacy TransDigm.","So, for the consolidated TransDigm business, a few quick notes on how we ended the first quarter of FY 2020. And as a reminder, Esterline closed mid-March of last year. So, it's not included in any of the fiscal 2019 stats that I'm about to reference.","As Nick and Kevin both mentioned, first quarter net sales were up approximately 48% versus the prior year. Organic sales growth was strong at 8.7% and this figure still completely excludes Esterline. So, it's for the legacy TransDigm business only. The Esterline acquisition drove the remaining 39% of the increase.","On EBITDA as defined $681 million for the quarter, that was up 40% versus last year and adjusted EPS of $4.93 was up 28%. On cash and liquidity, this gets a little messy due to the timing of the dividend. We declared the $32.50 per share dividend in December, but then did not pay it until early January. So, I'm just going to give you the pro forma financial stats since that's what matters. So, pro forma for that $32.50 dividend per share that was paid on January 7th, our cash balance is $2.3 billion and net debt-to-EBITDA is now 6.1 times. We also currently have access to about $720 million of our revolver.","Now, a quick update on interest and taxes. Interest expense is expected to be about $1.02 billion in fiscal 2020 and this estimate's unchanged from our prior guidance. As some of you may have seen, we're currently in the market with a repricing of our $7.5 billion of term loans. This reprice is still in the process of being finalized and we'll update the interest expense guidance next quarter once the repricing completes.","On taxes, our fiscal 2020 GAAP, cash, and adjusted rates are all still expected to be in the range of 24% to 26% which is unchanged from prior guidance. With regard to liquidity and leverage at the end of fiscal 2020, assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we now expect to have over $3 billion of cash on hand at the end of the year. This is a slight reduction from previous guidance just to account for the $1.9 billion dividend we paid in the first week of January.","In closing, the first quarter was a good start to the year for TransDigm. And with that I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Noah Poponak","Hey good morning everybody.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Nick I wanted to try to ask you if you could kind of take a step back and try to provide us some context for where the current fundamentals of the aerospace aftermarket are compared to your long history at the company. Because we've got the MAX situation, but then we've also got all the MRO facilities telling us there's a much longer wait than ever and we've got all these airplanes coming out of the warranty period. You just printed the number you printed. So, I'm just kind of curious is this as good as you've ever seen it? Is it in line with your average good time or is it something else? Would love to hear from you on that.","Nick Howley","Yeah. I don't know that I have any great insight for you. The \u2013 no, I mean, I see all those puts and takes too. I mean I'd have to put it on the better rather than worse side of the ledger though the slowing RPM always gets your attention a little bit. As you know that can be sort of a leading indicator sometimes.","The situation in China who knows where that goes. The -- I guess the closest model would be the SARS situation whatever that was some number of years ago. And that for a quarter or two had a pretty significant impact. I think I \u2013 obviously, I come down the same place as Kevin. We're sort of -- we're going to change our view from the beginning of the year. So I have to say there's probably a wider band around it than there might have been six months ago.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And just looking at the margin performance in the quarter, I think the framework from you for a little while has been 100 basis points a year in the core not recently acquired business. Is that still the right framework? Can you continue to do that even from a higher level?","Nick Howley","Kevin do you want to take that?","Kevin Stein","Yeah, I think that's still the right magnitude and I think we can continue to do that.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn","Nick or Kevin, I have a question for you and it relates to the MAX but it's higher level. Nick you've always had that chart about the life cycle of a TransDigm program. It's like 50 years these different colors and so forth. How long does a platform need to stay in service before you're MPV positive? When you get past the development costs and the zero to low-margin OE, how much of a run until you're in the black?","Nick Howley","I don't think I can give a number. We got so many different part numbers now and so many different economic situations. Some are significant essentially upfront and some aren't much. I don't think I can give you a very good number on that Rob.","I would say if you look at a program, it's going to have a development that goes on. Pick your number three, four, five, six seven years depending on the situation. You're not going to make much money until you get through the first four, five-year period because either you're on warranty or even if it's not a warranty as a practical matter things don't break much or you don't get much in the first four or five years. So you're surely out four, five years after production before you're starting to see any significant, I\u2019d say positive net on the whole thing. Beyond that I just -- it's just too dependent on the specific part in program.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then I just had one on Esterline. Now that you've got it, I think Kevin you said it's 10 months post deal. Have you found anything either more positive or more negative under the hood in that business being a publicly traded company versus the private companies you've bought? Anything specific there that would be interesting to us?","Kevin Stein","As we've talked about you get limited due diligence up front. So we went in not sure all that we would find. I think, in general, we've found that things have been better than we assumed up front and there hasn't really been, yet, anything that is a bad news, anything that we didn't anticipate or expect. It certainly emboldens us for the future to continue to look at acquisitions like this.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Was there anything different about their aftermarket pricing dynamic because they were public, versus the smaller private companies that you've bought in the past?","Kevin Stein","No, no. Not that we have seen, no.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you.","Kevin Stein","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company. Your question, please.","Gautam Khanna","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","I had two questions. First, I was wondering, have you noticed any continued or incremental hesitation by the defense department in placing orders, just given the whole overhang of the IG investigation? Does that explain anything in terms of lumpiness of bookings or anything you can point to there?","Kevin Stein","So to answer that one, first off, we have -- initially we saw some slowdown. We have been meeting frequently with the DoD, DOA, IG and other important stakeholders in the process, to continue to communicate, to answer questions. Once we started doing that, I think, some of the pent-up demand started to flow a little bit.","So I'm not believing that a slowdown to get to the point, I think, that you're driving at a slowdown in defense aftermarket bookings is anything more than a filling of the bins up around the ranch. That's still what we believe. We have seen that our interaction with the DoD, DOA has been positive. We're communicating, spending time, going through the issues and it's positive.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the commercial air transport aftermarket, in the quarter and maybe subsequent to the quarter, anything you can comment on by region? I mean, have you seen any coronavirus impact in Asia-Pac and\/or between the various channels, distributor versus non-distribution and what have you? If you can parse that out.","Kevin Stein","No. We don't look at our business like that from a geography. And it's also the way that our products are distributed and sold. You can sell to one region and that's where the distributor is based and it goes all over the world. So we're -- we don't have great data on individual consumption by country or airline or platform. So, no, we don't have that kind of visibility to offer you.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And any change -- any disconnect between the distribution channel in direct in the quarter? Any restocking?","Kevin Stein","No, no. We don't have a composite POS any longer that -- the flow-through sales from our distribution partners that we can comment on after the combination of Esterline into the TransDigm businesses, because they tended to use different distributors. It made the metric not as useful for us so far.","So I don't have any good comment on POS in distribution by region. I know what you're driving at and we keep looking for that as well to see if there's a pickup in 737 MAX related to the aftermarket in specific regions, are there any slowdown, but we don't have that kind of granularity to be able to give you that commentary.","Nick Howley","I mean the only thing I'd add is we're pretty well distributed across the fleet. So I mean, if you look at where the fleet is around the world and you look at where the miles are flowing around the world, ultimately if those change, the weighted impact of that will reflect on our demand at some point.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Your question, please.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Kevin Stein","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Kevin or Nick just wondered \u2013 I mean, if I've learned anything about you guys over the last decade or plus it's that you don't let resources sit around idle. So to the extent you've got folks in your factories that are perhaps overstaffed even if it's a temporary basis because of this MAX situation do you \u2013 would you have any intent on attacking productivity with those resources in the meantime? And could you end up coming on on the backside of this uncertainty with some better efficiency in your factories? How are you thinking about using that?","Kevin Stein","Of course, we look at all of these are opportunities to drive productivity. Productivity is an important part of our value driver mindset. We announced a 3% to 10% headcount reduction in the call so far. I think that's going to vary by business. We'll see the impact of that far out in the second half of the year. It'll vary by business depending on impact and what they're seeing and what the order book looks like.","So we're looking at this as the right thing to do to drive productivity. Is it opportunistic? And will we see better productivity out the other end? I don't know. We certainly aim to be very efficient in the way we run our businesses not let extra labor sit around, not go after PET programs or other projects. We're already working productivity aggressively. So there's maybe nothing additional to be gained by putting more people on productivity but we want to manage our headcount efficiently in all of our resources the correct way.","Nick Howley","Great. And the only thing I'd add Kevin is I believe 3% to 10% is not just factory. It's across the headcount.","Kevin Stein","Yes. It's direct to indirect.","Nick Howley","Yes.","Kevin Stein","Absolutely. And it will probably I don't know how it will split out on that. And the reason why I'm giving you a range is because we're still early in this process of implementing. I think most people have already been notified. But given our decentralized nature and this \u2013 the actions happen at the plants, they don't happen at corporate. So I'm still waiting to hear back on all of that.","Carter Copeland","But just thinking through the history I mean, I think about Nick in the past there was a sort of a measurable impact on the back end, if memory serves me right. Is that correct?","Nick Howley","I would hope so. We would expect that would be the case. I mean our hope is Carter to be out ahead of this not behind it.","Carter Copeland","Yes. Understood. Thanks, guys.","Nick Howley","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. Your question please.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","David Strauss","Nick you talked about the MAX being 3% to 4% of revenues less on an EBIT basis, is the 787 similar in magnitude?","Nick Howley","I think the 787's a little bit less. But I don't -- I'm not looking at that or in front of me. But we have modeled that that would drop by I believe it's four units a month in early 2021. So, yes that's factored into our thoughts. Okay. And as I said the 3% or 4% on the 737 just to be clear that is more like at full production.","Kevin Stein","Yes, that's full production to your point.","David Strauss","Right. I know you don't want to get too much into separating out Esterline anymore, but you gave some -- you gave enough detail for us to back into kind of where their EBITDA margins are and approximately where their EBIT margins are. Can you just talk -- I mean obviously, a bit away from the corporate average, but can you just talk about maybe broad-based views of where the margins on underlying Esterline could go based on now having the company for approaching a year?","Kevin Stein","Yes, that's -- obviously, we don't know. But in the fullness of time, it should continue to move in the direction that TransDigm is at. Whether it gets all the way there or not remains to be seen, but in the fullness of time, we don't see that this is a business that hampered in any way fundamentally.","David Strauss","Okay. And Mike on free cash flow, it looks like backing into everything you're looking at $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year roughly.","Mike Lisman","That's right. That's right. It was stronger this quarter than it will be next quarter just because of the timing of interest and tax payments. We have fewer payments this quarter and next quarter our fiscal Q2 double payments on interest and taxes. So, it's a little bit less. But that's right for the year.","David Strauss","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Your question please.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Kevin I think you mentioned that the biz jet aftermarket was strong in the quarter, but underlying FAA activity is still flat. I was wondering if maybe you could perhaps explain that disconnect there perhaps why the number was so strong this quarter.","Kevin Stein","Yes, I wish I had some better -- it's surprising to us as well. Given the take-offs and landings after a few years of strength still not back to the pre-2008 levels but we just haven't seen anything and recently it's gone negative. So, our -- what we're seeing here is a little bit of a surprise I'll have to say and I don't know how long it will last.","Certainly, the fundamentals of the industry don't appear to be good, but we're still seeing solid demand. So, we will continue to ship it, but I wish I had a better explanation for you on why or where it's coming from.","What we see across this business given the aftermarket nature whether its defense, it's commercial, it's bizjet is that aftermarket orders can be lumpy and that's part of what we're seeing I think.","Robert Stallard","Yes. And then on the whole MAX issue, have you actually taken -- I know you're making lots of different products. I mean have you taken your rate down to zero? Or are you still running some of your products at some sort of rate so you can keep your supply chain to heal?","Kevin Stein","Yeah, we have had some communication with Boeing on what this will look like. We have taken our rates down to zero more or less where we are right now. And it will gradually build out based on what Boeing is communicating to us, which again this is early days in the communication process. So we're following their guidance on this, I\u2019m not hedging it further.","Robert Stallard","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from UBS. Your question please.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Myles Walton","I was wondering Kevin maybe you can clarify a little bit on the cost action you're taking. Is the cost action effect to 2020 net neutral positive or negative to EBITDA?","Kevin Stein","I think it's too early to tell right now. We are still figuring out the downside of some of the headwinds we're talking about balancing this out. I think, I need a little more time to comment on that on whether it's neutral or will add anything to the EBITDA for the year. So, I just need a little more time on that. It's too early in the year to change that.","Myles Walton","Okay.","Nick Howley","But there's no reason to think the adjustments could be negative.","Kevin Stein","I'm just not -- I don't want to give you an idea that it's going to be one way or the other.","Nick Howley","Yes. ","Myles Walton","Sorry, I mean is there a cost to achieve that will be front-loaded to the second quarter or third quarter that we should be mindful for and you catch up on the benefit in the back half of the year? That's all.","Nick Howley","Myles are you talking about severance charges?","Myles Walton","Yeah exactly.","Nick Howley","We don't expect those to be too material. No.","Myles Walton","Okay.","Kevin Stein","But yeah they'll -- but still they would hit us earlier.","Nick Howley","They hit us earlier next quarter.","Myles Walton","Okay. And then Nick a little bit off topic, but I think still relevant. Your role at -- I'm just curious as you look at -- you're dividing your time between here and as that business matures. Can you just talk about how you think your roles may stay the same or change over time? Thanks.","Nick Howley","Yeah. My primary activity is here of course. As you probably know I'm a Chairman there. I'm not an active manager and an investor.","Myles Walton","Okay. So no anticipation of any role changes at all?","Nick Howley","No.","Myles Walton","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Your question please.","Ken Herbert","Hi, good morning.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Ken Herbert","Kevin I just \u2013 sorry, but I just wanted to follow-up one more time on the commercial aftermarket and the up 17 in the quarter. I mean it sounds like there wasn't anything unusual but I just wanted to confirm that you didn't see anything in terms of maybe airline budget dumping around end of the calendar year or any of the recent distribution agreements or anything else you've signed that could have been one-time beyond just fundamental growth in the quarter?","Kevin Stein","No. We look for it. It was a surprise that it was a solid strong as it was. I will say that that's -- the 17 in the quarter isn't just an artifact of the acquisition. TransDigm legacy, although I said I wouldn't refer to this I wanted to give you some reassurance that the TransDigm legacy business would have still been a highlight -- a headline number that everyone would have reacted to. So we're seeing strength across the board. It's not due to a program. It's not due to a single business unit and it really wasn't any one-timers that we saw in there.","Ken Herbert","That's helpful. And if I could just bigger picture, I mean, you \u2013 as you talked about, you're almost a year into closing Esterline. As you think about your acquisition pipeline and as you think about opportunities moving forward, can you just talk a little bit about maybe what you'll do differently moving forward on acquisitions, or some of the lessons learned that you can apply which would make what already was, from the outside, a very good process, potentially even better?","Kevin Stein","I'll start on it and I'll let Mike and Nick jump in. I don't know if there's so much that we learned, except that maybe we're a little conservative in some of our modeling. So that's good. It's good for all of us. Good for you. I think we've learned that we can go after a significant business multifaceted, many moving pieces. And with our model and the way we handle the integration that we can tackle them and so do a nice job of bringing them into the fold, into the fabric of TransDigm. That's what I think I've learned and from what I've seen on the operational side.","And also the folks in the acquired company are very interested in being on a winning team and it's amazing, the attitude, the morale, the real positive perspective that the employees have, as they're now part of this team, is really incredible and it's why I think we're accomplishing some pretty heavy lifting so quickly. Guys anything?","Mike Lisman","I think that's right. One thing I'd add too is, just on the aftermarket point. We looked at Esterline from the outside in for years before the acquisition finally happened and looked at the aftermarket and couldn't make sense of the low 10% to 12% rate that was published. And I think from an M&A due diligence standpoint, one thing going forward is, we might put less faith on what a company tells us, just because they might not be tracking it the way TransDigm would.","Nick Howley","Yeah. I guess, I'd say a couple of things. I think, our organizational method of keeping it separate for the first 12 months or so, I think, was a plus and that there's \u2013 you buy something with that many operating units and there's a lot of heavy lifting to be done in the first year.","So keeping that so it didn't confuse and leak over into our base business, I think, was a good call for us. And I think it's a model we probably think to repeat again if we bought something like that. I think we also had a combination of, what I'll call, good luck and good management. By the good management I'd say, we're in a space we know pretty well. So we can make judgments, even when some of the numbers don't make sense. And I think our operating methodology is -- works well and proven over and over.","I'd say in the good luck category, I'd say, we were conservative in the forecast because we \u2013 you don't get as much information as you usually get. And when you buy something and good luck category is there, didn't turn out to be a big bump in there somewhere. So that's the comments I have.","Ken Herbert","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your question please.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Nick or Kevin, I think, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Esterline growth was tracking ahead of expectations. Can you just maybe give a little bit more color there, knowing that you're not going to parse it out? But was it just more general end market strength that you're seeing across all of your product line? Was it a little bit of pricing, better execution? I mean is there are you seeing that aftermarket capture that maybe Esterline didn't execute on in the past? Maybe just if you can give some color there.","Kevin Stein","Yes. I'll take a stab at it and then Mike has some more maybe insight. I think productivity and the value-based pricing I think we've seen great opportunities in both on the \u2013 specifically on the commercial side. It's encouraging what we've seen. Beyond that we have seen certainly productivity improvements. We've seen opportunities to inject cash to get delinquencies down. There were some significant delinquencies in parts of the business. There were some capitalization issues that need to be addressed.","I think we've approached this on an operational front to drive the Esterline business much like we focus, the TransDigm legacy business on being the best operations performers they can be having the best quality, the best on-time delivery, being an organization that you can really count on. That's really been our focus here. And we've seen opportunities. We've said in the past equally split on productivity and price and winning new business. I think that still holds. Mike do you have any?","Mike Lisman","Yes. I think that's right. In addition to some of the productivity and all the points, Kevin made, the Esterline business has seen good growth. So for the TransDigm legacy business we referenced the 8.7% organic growth that the Esterline business is growing in that same sort of ballpark. So pretty strong revenue growth and it's from a mix of both price and volume.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe Mike just one last one. The full year interest expense I think $1.02 billion, any color as to how the debt repricing might impact that expense as you sit here today and go through the process?","Mike Lisman","Yes. We're crossing Is or crossing Ts with Is to finish it this week. It should wrap up this Thursday and we'll issue an 8-K, but we expect the rate to tick down slightly on the term loans. Now we also got that package of amendments.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Konrad from Jefferies. Your question please.","Greg Konrad","Good morning.","Mike Lisman","Good morning.","Greg Konrad","Just to go back to the MAX really quickly just a clarification question. You said it was 3% to 4% of sales and you had some headcount reductions later on this year. I mean, how much of that MAX capacity is fungible and can be reallocated to aftermarket or OE programs versus just idle capacity today?","Kevin Stein","Yes. I would say not much of it. Aftermarket is built on the same lines as the OEM products for the largest extent. So the volume occurs on the OEM side. You can't make it up in aftermarket. You can't move people around necessarily. They're trained on certain pieces of equipment or processes. So I would say it's not that fungible that you can so easily move people around. We certainly try to do that first. And where there are needs we try to certainly move people. It's \u2013 you have to take a riff or reduction when you don't see those opportunities out there.","Greg Konrad","Thanks. And then I know it's small but you mentioned a modest decline in the interior aftermarket. I think last quarter you talked about some international wins kind of converting to sales as we move forward. What are you seeing in that particular end market?","Kevin Stein","Yes. The -- for the quarter for Q1 it was a little soft. So, I think I commented that we saw some negative growth there and then on the freight side. The freight side it made sense. We've seen slowing FTKs for a while.","On the interiors, I noted previously we were starting to see some orders some interest here that would turn things around. And that's I think the case when I look at the bookings for the future and our interior side of the business, they're starting to grow again. So, that may be an indication that future quarters will be better on the interior side of the aftermarket.","Greg Konrad","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your question please.","Mike Maugeri","Hi, this is actually Mike on for -- Mike Maugeri for Hunter. So, you mentioned some cuts to some big programs. Are those production cuts due to end market weakness, product transitions, or is it large cabin, multiple market segments, any color would help.","Kevin Stein","I don't think I said that we were seeing any cuts in bizjet. I think what we're seeing on the OEM side is new programs. We're on all of the important new programs here on the business jet side and we're seeing bookings come in. We're seeing shipments on that.","On the aftermarket side, I think pleasantly surprised that the aftermarket and the biz jet sector is holding up so well given the takeoff and landing cycles have been anemic. That's what we said. It's -- yes, business jet is a tougher market to understand. It's a small part of our business now as we've grown other sectors faster, but it has been difficult to predict over the last I think even a couple of years.","Mike Maugeri","That helps. Thank you. And then one for Mike. How are you thinking about taxes? And I'm thinking like over the next three to five years. So, how are you thinking about changes to tax code beyond 2021 or are there any things that we need to be thinking about there? Thank you.","Mike Lisman","I don't think so. The long-term guidance on across all three rates is still 24% to 26%. And if you were looking for something to plug into a model, I'd encourage you to just stick in that range at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning everyone.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Seth Seifman","With regard to the margin guide, the seasonal pattern is to see improvement off of Q1 and Q1 was relatively strong versus the guidance. I appreciate the idea of having some caution in the guidance given all the unknowns out there for this year. But given that the severance is not supposed to be that material, is there anything else that we should be aware of that would keep that kind of sequential margin improvement from happening other than just trying to be very cautious amid MAX Coronavirus whatever else is happening in the world?","Kevin Stein","I think that the guidance just reflects our best judgment and we're hopefully being a little bit cautious and conservative to your margin point.","Nick Howley","I completely agree with that. It's caution in there. There's a lot of information isn't known and we don't want to send the wrong signals and have to change them or modify them. We'd rather be cautious on this.","Liza Sabol","But also to remind you though that the aftermarket grew ahead of what we expected for Q1. And so that there very well could be a sequential decline in the margin from Q1 to Q2.","Kevin Stein","It's a good point.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then as a quick follow-up Nick. Just when you think about the impact that the MAX situation might have on M&A opportunities over time. Do you have any initial thoughts on that maybe suppliers who might be more apt to be looking to sell now?","Nick Howley","No. Not that I know of. It would surprise me if it had much impact. As you know we buy proprietary aerospace stuff with a decent aftermarket. In other words, we buy good businesses. People usually don't sell good businesses in times of temporary down cycle. Now if you told me this was going to drop down like a rock and go on for a long period of time I'd say that might stress some people. But given the situation that exists today, I'd be surprised if it changes anyone's view of the -- either the whole period or what they want to buy or sell for good businesses. Now, I would say for non-proprietary businesses that are very heavily weighted towards OEM or particularly the 737, it could stress the hell out of them but that's not the kind of stuff that we typically buy.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Liza Sabol for any further remarks.","Liza Sabol","We'd just like to thank you all for calling in this morning and that concludes our call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

My name is Kelly, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Liza Sabol. Please proceed, Lisa.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. I would like to thank all for calling in today, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2012 third quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Ray Laubenthal; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. Replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Please see the tables related to footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA. As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley","Good morning and thanks to everybody for calling in to hear about our company. Before I begin with the quarterly results, I would like to just talk about one tragic event that occurred in Q3. Al Rodriguez our Head of M&A, passed away suddenly at 51 years old. Al was a significant contributor to the company since the formation of TransDigm. We lost a business partner and a good friend here.","But moving on, Bernie Iversen, another long term member of our senior management team, who has also been with us since the formation of the company has taken over the M&A position. Bernie has had a broad range of operating positions at TransDigm at a number of different locations. He was most recently a Group Vice President, a Group Executive Vice President in charge of a number of our operating units. Bernie has been involved with many of our acquisitions, which will facilitate a smooth transition in his role. Bernie hits the ground pretty well running here.","Now with that behind me, I'd like to review our consistent strategy, our current sense of the status in the aerospace market, as it applies to us and a few miscellaneous items.","To reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency, and in its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle.","To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, and that these are highlighted on page 4 of the slides. About 90% of the net sales are generated by proprietary products and around three quarters of our net sales come from products, for which we are the sole source provider. About 60% of our revenue, and a much higher percentage of EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have starkly produced a higher gross margin, and have provided relative stability in the cyclical downturns.","Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, typically in the range of 50% of revenue, and relatively low capital expenditure requirements, typically less than 2% of the revenue, TransDigm has year in, year out, generated strong free cash flow. We pay close attention to our capital structure, and we view it as another means to create shareholder value. As you know, we have in the past and continue to be, willing to lever up when we either see good opportunities, or view our leverage as suboptimum for value creation.","We typically begin to deleverage pretty quickly. Based on the credit markets, our near term cash needs, and potential near term acquisition candidates, we address our liquidity and capital structure regularly.","We have a well proven value based operating strategy, focused around what we refer to as our three value drivers; new business development, continual cost improvement and value based pricing. We stick to these concepts as the core of our operating management methodologies. This consistent approach has worked for us through up and down markets, and allowed us to continuously improve and increase the intrinsic value of our businesses, while steadily investing in new business and platform positions.","We have also been successful in regularly acquiring and integrating businesses. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses, with significant aftermarket content. We have been able to acquire and improve proprietary aerospace businesses through all phases of the cycle.","Through our consistent focus on our operating value drivers, a clear acquisition strategy, and close attention to our capital structure, we have been able to create intrinsic value for our investors for many years, through up and down markets.","The just completed quarter was active, with some cleanup divestiture issues relating to the AmSafe acquisition, we now have agreements to sell two small non-core businesses, with 2011 EBITDA of about $3 million to $4 million in total. It appears at this time, that the market price is not sufficient for us to sell the AmSafe Ground Transportation business, to remind you that 2011 EBITDA was about $5 million from this business. We believe we can improve this business, and over the year or so, possibly remarket it.","After about six months of ownership, we continue to be comfortable with our ability to increase the value of the core AmSafe Aerospace business, through a mix of all three of our usual value drivers. Again, I don't know that this business can achieve an EBITDA percent as high as the TransDigm average, we still see significant upside, at least as good as our acquisition assumptions.","At 6\/30, we had about $300 million in cash, about $300 million in undrawn revolver. We expect to generate over $100 million in additional cash, than the last quarter of fiscal year 2012. We also added additional capacity under our credit agreement. We estimated our gross debt to EBITDA ratio on a pro forma basis at 6\/30 is about 4.5 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 4.1 times.","As in the past, absent acquisitions or other capital market actions, we will continue to de-lever. We currently anticipate the fiscal year end leverage to be about 3.9 times on a net basis, assuming no additional actions.","With respect to our underlying markets, the markets are a little bumpy, but in aggregate, at this time it still appears to support our full year guidance. The commercial markets are generally positive, the defense market, though less clear, is still holding up better than we originally expected, and roughly in line with our prior guidance","In the commercial OEM market, industry forecasters and airframe manufacturers continue to be optimistic regarding the commercial transport OEM production cycle and backlog. Rate increases are proceeding in Airbus and Boeing and revenues continue to reflect that. The 787 schedule is still not quite clear and it won't materially impact fiscal year 2012.","On a positive note, there now appears to be more predictability in the 787 airframe shipments. We will likely see a period of inventory sorting out before our 787 shipments track airframe shipments. In total, our full year commercial transport OEM business share revenues on a pro forma basis are expected to be up in the high-teen percent versus last year.","In the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see growth in worldwide passenger traffic, though a bit spotty and somewhat muted. To remind you, last year our commercial aftermarket was up almost 25% on a year-over-year. This was not a sustainable level for growth rate. This quarter, on a pro forma basis, we saw an increase over both our prior year \u2013 fiscal year Q3 as well as sequentially versus the current year Q2.","I will review these specifics later in this presentation. We are watching this carefully. The commercial aftermarket is a big bumpy and not consistent across our businesses and the revenue comps are tough in Q4.","In the defense market, though there are still major uncertainties around defense spending, we now anticipate the defense revenues to be up modestly in fiscal year 2012. Despite the first three quarters being better than we anticipated, we remain cautious. As I mentioned regarding commercial aftermarket, the revenue comps are tough in Q4. Military revenue can be tough to predict, especially given the current US political wins and the worldwide geopolitical situation.","Now let me turn to our latest financial performance. I will remind you this is the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2011. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by differences in OEM aftermarket mix, large orders, transient inventory fluctuations in the system, modest seasonality, and other factors.","Our third quarter fiscal year '12 was another good quarter. GAAP revenues were up about 42% versus the prior year. Organic revenue growth is up about 10% on a quarter versus quarter basis and 14% on a year-to-date basis.","Reviewing the revenues by market category and this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year and much of this is on slide 5. And by pro forma, I mean, assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. Again, these pro forma comps do include the two most recent acquisitions, Harco and AmSafe.","In the commercial aftermarket \u2013 commercial markets, which now make up about \u2013 almost 80% of our current revenue, the commercial percent has been rising recently as a percent of our total business. In the OEM market, revenues were up about 16% versus the prior year Q3 and 24% on a year-to-date basis.","Commercial transport OEM and business jet OEM revenue percentage growth both slowed a little in Q3. The picture was mixed by product lines, but the primary unfavorable factors included 787 overstock and finishing delays, minor 380 delay impacts, and some disruption from the Hawker bankruptcy.","Excluding the impact of the retroactive contract settlements, the increase in our commercial OEM business is approximately 20% on a year-to-date business.","Moving now to the commercial aftermarket, commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 6% on Q3 versus Q3 basis and about 10% on a year-to-date basis. The revenues were up modestly sequentially. Though the specifics are still unclear anecdotally, there still seems to be indications of inventory trimming and a generalized economic concern by many airlines. I can't at this time quantify this specifically.","A few additional bits of color on the commercial aftermarket, the total commercial aftermarket bookings ran slightly ahead of revenues on a year-to-date basis and they are roughly even in the Q3.","The business jet and GA aftermarket was down slightly in the third quarter versus the prior year third quarter. The commercial transport aftermarket revenue was up about 7% versus the prior Q3, but again was spotty across our operating units and product lines.","To-date we have seen little, if any, 787 aftermarket orders or shipments. We are watching trends here very closely. The macroeconomic conditions are, of course, concerning.","In the defense market, which now makes up a little over 20% of our current revenue, the defense picture again continues better than we expected. The revenues were up 7% on Q3 versus prior Q3 basis. On a year-to-date basis, they are up about 5%. Incoming orders are slightly ahead of the shipping rates on a year-to-date Q3. We will see how this plays out.","As I said, the military picture is not \u2013 is clear and for obvious reasons we remain cautious. In total for the revenue \u2013 for the quarter, our revenues were a bit better than we expected.","Moving to profitability and now on a reported basis, I am going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. The major as defined adjustments are made up of acquisitions and stock option expenses. Greg will review various other items on the income statement in his portion.","For Q3, our EBITDA as defined of $217 million was up 34% versus the prior Q3, the EBITDA as defined margins 47% for the quarter versus the prior Q3 of 50%. The acquisition mix pulled the margin down by 4 margin points in the third quarter.","The year-to-date EBITDA as defined margins is running about 48% of revenue. There are number of moving parts to complicate EBITDA margin a bit. So as I did last year just to help understand the year-to-date, I break it out little. The base business including the McKechnie in spite of a modest OEM aftermarket mix down is running at about 15% of revenue.","The Schneller, Harco and AmSafe acquisition dilution pulls it down about 2.5% and we pick up about 0.5% from the various contract settlements and special items through the year. That totals about 48% of the revenue that comes to.","With respect to M&A activity, as I said, we've closed two acquisitions year-to-date, AmSafe and Harco for about $840 million. We continue actively looking at opportunities. In the last 2 to 3 months, the pipeline seems to be picking up. We are seeing more activity than we did in the last 3 to 6 months. Closings were always difficult to predict. And I, as always, can't speak about any specifics, but we remain disciplined and focused on the buying strategy and clear value creation acquisition opportunities.","I'll refer to the midpoint in the following and these numbers going forward here do not include any future acquisitions. Based on all the above, we have increased the midpoint of our EPS as adjusted guidance by $0.24 a share, that is from $6.40 a share to $6.64. This increase is just about half attributable to improve tax rate.","We now expect TransDigm's revenues to be right around $1.7 billion or almost the same as the prior guidance. 2012 EBITDA as defined is now anticipated to be in the range of $806 million, that\u2019s up $6 million from our previous guidance. This is generally fine-tuning as we get closer to year end.","On a full-year basis, the EBITDA [as defined] margin of 58% is roughly made up -- 48%. Back up, the full-year EBITDA margin of 48% is made up of the following. The base business, including McKechnie, again in spite of a modest OEM aftermarket mix down, should end somewhere around 51% and the Schneller, Harco and AmSafe full year dilution should be about 3% getting us to the 48.","Compared with 2011, and again on a pro-forma basis, we're now planning on full-year commercial aerospace OEM revenues to be up in the high teen percent. For commercial aftermarket, on a pro-forma basis, we're planning on a full year revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range based on worldwide traffic up in the 4% to maybe 4.5% range. And also the recent softening in the bus jet GA market. This implies about a 7% Q4 versus Q4 growth to the midpoint of our guidance here.","Obviously, the aftermarket trends we've seen reported around the industry can service. Our guidance assumes we don't see any significant additional economic softening in the next two to three months. For defense revenues, we are now planning year-over-year revenues to be up modestly.","In summary, our third quarter continued strong, the markets are a bit tenuous but seeing in total to be supportive of our guidance. In any event I'm confident by focusing on our consistent strategy, we can continue to create intrinsic value in good and bad times.","Now with that, let me hand this over to Ray Laubenthal, our COO, who will talk a little about some operating items in Q3 and little about some new business.","Ray Laubenthal","Thanks, Nick. As he mentioned, in total we had a very busy third quarter with good operational results. We were quite busy with acquisition transitions in several divestitures.","Operating units, we also continued to diligently work our value drivers and we continued to create shareholder value. Let me explain our third quarter acquisition integration and operational activities in a little more detail.","Almost six months ago, we acquired the AmSafe businesses. Our acquisition transition work is progressing well and starting to generate real value. To-date, we have closed and absorbed the AmSafe corporate office into our own, we have consolidated four AmSafe satellite locations into several of the existing AmSafe locations and we have also restructured the AmSafe aftermarket process.","These consolidation moves and pricing actions have started to expand the EBITDA margins and we believe we're running ahead of our value creation expectations for this acquisition.","We are now implementing our proven product line structure at AmSafe. Each business now has several product lines. Our product line structure consists of a product line manager who is responsible for the product line, P&L and creating real value.","Implementing this product line structure at acquisition takes a lot of work. In addition to the product line manager, we formed a product line team that's focused on our three value drivers, those being value pricing, productivity improvement, and managing profitable new business generation. We're also applying our proven set of product line metrics that are focused on tracking value creation process.","Additionally, we are conducting specific product line training, ranging from negotiating customer contracts, implementing value pricing, driving productivity improvement and managing and financially modeling new business programs.","At our other recent acquisitions, Schneller and Harco, those are also transitioning well. At Schneller, their Kent, Ohio building expansion is nearly complete. We are on track to consolidate their entire Florida facility into the Kent operations next months. This consolidation will eliminate many redundant operations, streamline production and improve their cost structure.","At both, Schneller and Harco, the aftermarket process has been restructured, other cost reductions have been implemented and we also organized these two businesses into our product line structure.","Now let me turn on discussion to our base operating units and their recent value generation activities. Overall, the base TransDigm operating units are performing well. They have diligently controlled their cost structures and have managed resources tightly. They also continue to execute our consistent value focus operating strategy.","Our new business development has continued to be quite active during the past several years. We continue to invest in a broad range of engineered solutions for our customers and for this call, I'd like to give a summation of our new business content on the three newest commercial platforms; the Boeing 787, the A380 and the A350. And each of these programs we have increased our pro forma ship set dollar content substantially over the predecessor platforms.","That is on a same-store basis, we have significantly more proprietary product dollars on each of these new platforms than we had on the platforms they are replacing. These are new business awards -- these new business awards not only secure new OEM production revenues, but they also secure our future aftermarket revenues. To give this a little color, I'd like to give some examples of our content on these new platforms.","On the 787 program, we have increased our ship set dollar content by over 60% versus the predecessor platforms. In addition to wining a larger footprint of product applications, we have increased our dollar content as the aircraft's advanced design has increased many of the products scope and complexity.","For example, we're now supplying a broad range of composite products which make the 787 lighter and safer. These products include composite fuel system isolators and hydraulic system isolators, which arrest the propagation of electrical energy during a lighting strike; the complex composite structural elements which reduce weight and improve aircraft fuel efficiency.","And in addition to composites, we are supplying a broad range of latching mechanisms for both internal cabin and external engine (inaudible) applications. The cockpit communication system which is immigrated into the aircraft computer system, the ignition systems for those aircraft about half delivered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine, the seatbelt variety which the new airbag technology incorporated to them for added safety and for luggage and cargo area restraint systems.","On the A380 program, we have increased out ship set dollar content by over 90% versus the predecessor platforms. Similar to the Boeing 787, we've also increased our footprint and our dollar content as the aircraft's advanced design has increased the product application scope and complexity.","For example, we are supplying the entire cockpit door module which includes the entire cockpit bulkhead, [separation] wall, the ballistic door and cockpit security system. The complex horizontal trim stabilizer valves and control systems along with the main engine lubrication system and components, a broad range of latching mechanisms and structured elements employed throughout the airframe and on the complex engine itself.","On the engine, we're supplying the ignition system for those aircraft again about half outfitted with the Rolls Royce Trent-900 engine. And on the interior we are supplying decorative wall and bulkhead engineered laminates and the seat belts and seat belt airbag systems.","On the A350 Program not all the application contracts have been awarded yet, but so far we've already increased our ship set dollar content versus the predecessor platforms and we expect this contract expansion to well exceed the predecessor once all this open contract bids are finalized.","Similar to the 787 and the A380 with increase the foot print and dollar content is the aircraft advance design is increased the product applications scope and complexity. For example like the A380 was supplying the entire cockpit door module which includes the cockpit bulkhead, separation lock, ballistic door and the cockpit security system.","We're also supplying a variety of engine valves, hydraulic systems valves, landing gear valves, water system and waste systems valves and a broad range of latching mechanisms and structural elements for both internal and external applications with many employed on the complex engine itself.","We are supplying the ignition systems for those aircraft about half again outfitted with the Rolls Royce Trent XWB engine. And lastly we are bidding on a significant number of other product applications that we expect to be awarded as the A350 design work is completed.","These new engineered solutions have increased our content on the next generation aircraft entering into service and this three major programs exemplify our advance technology our advance technical ability to develop value-driven solutions for our customers, it also demonstrates our continued commitment to invest in our product lines and to organically grow our OEM business and more importantly secure future feature aftermarket revenues.","Now let me hand it over to Greg Rufus CFO, he'll review our third quarter and year-to-date financial results in more detail.","Greg Rufus","Thanks, Ray. I hope everyone had an opportunity to read our press release, which was issued this morning.","Before we jump into the details let me remind you again that we acquired Schneller in the fourth quarter of fiscal '11, Harco in our first quarter of this year AmSafe in our second quarter of this year. The current quarter and comparisons to the prior year are significantly impacted by this recent acquisitions.","Please references slide seven, for our quarterly financial results. Third quarter net sale was $462 million up $137 million or 42% from the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions of Schneller, Harco, and AmSafe contributed approximately $106 million of additional sales versus the prior period.","Or just over about three quarters of the increase in sales. In addition our organic growth was almost 10% greater from the prior year. All market channels contributed to this growth. $20 million came from commercial OEM and aftermarket and $10 million from defense which was evenly split between OEM and aftermarket.","Our reported gross profit was $253 million or 55% of sales. The reported gross profit margin decrease by almost 1.5 percentage points versus the prior year. The dilutive impact of acquisition mix from Schneller, Harco, and AmSafe was approximately 2 margin points versus the prior year quarter, partially offsetting this was improved margins in a club business despite unfavorable OEM to aftermarket prior next experience this quarter.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.2% of sales for the current quarter, compared to 9.7% in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the following: We had a $3 million accrual reduction in quarter 3 of the prior year relating to an acquisition earn-out adjustment. Also we have higher run rates of selling and administrative expenses as the percentage sales from our recent acquisition and we have an increase in stock compensation expense versus the prior year quarter.","Net interest expense was $55 million and increase was approximately $5 million versus the prior year quarter. This is our a result of the increase in weighted average total debt to $3.6 billion in the current quarter versus $3.1 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt is due to the additional term loan related to the AmSafe acquisition made in February of this year. But weighted average cash interest rates on total balance at the end of the current quarter is approximately 5.7%.","Our effective tax rate was approximately 31% in the current quarter. The lower rate is due to the following: We had a settlement of an IRS audit for fiscals year '09 and fiscals year '10. And then we also made adjustments to the current year resulting from filing our FY '11 federal income tax return. We now effective tax rate to be between 33% and 34% for the full year.","Net income from continuing operations for the quarter increased $32 million or 55% to $90 million which is approximately 20% of our sales. This compares to net income from continuing ops of $58 million in the prior year. The net income increase of 55% is greater than the increase in sales of 42% due to the following three items. We have leverage and lower interest expense as a percentage sales we have a lower effective income tax rate and these two items were positively off set our higher acquisition related in non cash compensation cost.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.58 in the current quarter compared to $1.10 per share a year ago due to the increase in net income from continuing operations we just discussed. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.88 per share an increase of 55% compared to $1.21 per share last year. The quarter adjustments to GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 per share the adjustments net of tax are acquisitions related expenses of $0.12 per share and non-cash compensation cost of the $0.08 per share.","Cash flow from operations was strong at $238 million through the third quarter of fiscal 2012 despite using a little over $330 million of cash on the balance sheet to help partially fund the acquisition of Harco and AmSafe, we ended this quarter with over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet.","Our net debt leverage ratio was 4.1 times our pro forma EBITDA as defined, we expect to continue to delever and we now project that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 3.9 times our pro forma EBITDA defined at the end this year September 30.","Moving to guidance. We estimate the midpoint of our gap EPS to be $5.93, as Nick previously mentioned we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $6.64. The $0.71 to bridge GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS includes the falling items: $0.40 for acquisition related expenses, $0.25 cents to non- cash stock option expense and $0.06 cents from dividend equivalent payments.","Now let me hand it over to Liza to kick off, Q and A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. Operator we are now ready to open the lines.","Operator","Okay, thank you, Liza.","(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey, good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Two question one, Nick, I wondered if you might talk about the environment as we think about the set up here for your fiscal '13. It doesn't look like we've had a year like this during an up cycle where we've seen aftermarkets slows since sort of '05, '06. And you guys saw at that time a pretty good snapback in organic growth in the commercial aftermarket following that period. Are we setting up for something like this? Or do you think we are going to be in this sort of weak level next year, especially given the traffic numbers kind of coming in a little bit better than people would forecast all year long? I wondered if you might help us think about what you are thinking about 2013.","Nick Howley","One, Carter, as you know, I can't back into 2013 guidance yet. And our view on aftermarket gets you pretty close to the guidance for the year probably, but, I mean, the reality is, we are uncertain. I think this is primarily a function of worldwide economic activity. If you believe we're just in little bit of a dip or slowing down and it moves on sharply again, either as we proceed into the next quarter or after the election, I think you will likely see some kind of a snapback like you talked about. But that looks very uncertain to me right now, Carter. I don't have to call it. If I sit here today, I describe myself as quite cautious.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Can you see anything within the product lines? You said it was bumpy and different throughout the business. But if you look at products that are discretionary versus nondiscretionary, are you seeing weakness in discretionary items that would support that conclusion or is there any data on a more granular basis that helps you get comfortable with that kind of viewpoint?","Nick Howley","No. The true answer is, Carter, no. By the way, hopefully, all the answers are true, but I can say and frankly this somewhat surprised me. As I look at our more discretionary things, parts in the last month and we are in the middle of our business planning review process so we are looking at detail of all the product line. Surprisingly, they don't look down any more than average or I can't say they are systematically off more. It's kind of surprised me which I don't know what that tells me, other than I don't see a systematic pulling back on discretionary items, particularly at this point.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, thanks. And one question quickly on the margin, Nick, you mentioned a 2.5 point impact from acquisition dilution and then Greg mentioned two. Is that just a difference between the quarter and the year and how you were talking about?","Nick Howley","There are two things. For the quarter, I am always talking EBITDA margins and Greg was talking gross profit. So for the quarter, the dilution was 4 points on EBITDA margin for the acquisitions. For the year-to-date, it was 2.5 points for the acquisition dilution. The Greg's 2 points was gross profit, Greg, am I correct? Not.","Greg Rufus","Not EBITDA because we also \u2013 the SG&A is higher because of the acquisitions also.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes, exactly. And so with respect to that, if you look specifically at the acquisitions, it will look sequentially the margins were similar, did they increase or was there something going on there in terms of your cost efforts, in terms of the relocation and what not that would cause that to be the case. Can you comment on how the acquisition margins trended quarter-to-quarter?","Nick Howley","I am not following the question. You're drawing some conclusion that they changed somehow from here?","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes. It looks per our math that the sequential margins \u2013 the margins would have been roughly flat sequentially for the acquired businesses. And I was wondering if that was actually the case per your numbers?","Nick Howley","The truth is I don't remember exactly what specifically the acquisitions were quarter-to-quarter, but I would be surprised if they were flat. Generally, they are moving up.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay.","Nick Howley","But I can't remember, Carter, what they were the last quarter, but in general they are moving up.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","But the G&A way down, is that the right G&A going forward?","Nick Howley","Yes. And I suspect somehow we are losing this in a quarter in rounding or something like that, I suspect.","Greg Rufus","They are smaller numbers versus the total, but the trend is that they are expanding.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, great. I will let somebody else ask.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Nick Howley","Good morning, Myles.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","It looks like the fourth quarter commercial OEM sales if I have done the math kind of right, it implies slowing up to mid-single-digit growth. And I know Nick you mentioned some of the 787 inventory, but I am curious if that math is right and are there other things driving it compares and\/or 787?","Nick Howley","Well, what are you getting when you saw for the fourth quarter?","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Kind of mid-single-digit growth if it's 24% year-to-date and up high-teens for the year?","Nick Howley","Yes. I would have thought you get closer to 10% but yes it's a little bit slower. That I wouldn't \u2013 that is just reflective of what the timing is on different product lines. I mean, generally, we are primarily in the commercial OEM. If you look at the commercial transport production rates, we are pretty evenly distributed across the miles. We probably run, I don't know depending on the product line somewhere between 3 and 12 months ahead, so maybe 6 months. So any whatever you are saying is just quarterly impact.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Nick Howley","It's just a timing question on shipments. Now I would say sometime if things start to back up in '14 in the commercial transport growth rate, we will start to see that sometime in '13.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Those kind of the first part of the questions. So it looks like your implied aftermarket growth is about the same as your implied OEM growth, maybe it's slightly smaller in the fourth quarter, but it looks like that mix won't be hurting you as much in the fourth quarter. And presumably your acquisitions will be a little bit better in the fourth quarter. And I think the guidance doesn't imply much of an uptick in EBITDA margins as defined in the fourth quarter. So I was just wondering if I am missing anything or if it's just conservatism?","Nick Howley","I think probably the difference in those growth rates is probably too close to call and it's in the noise level in the quarter when you look at it over full year. I think we are trying to get pretty close to what we think now.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","But that implied flat EBITDA margin as defined is about 47% in the fourth quarter versus 47% you did here in the third quarter, any reason that shouldn't be higher given higher volumes in another quarter of integration?","Nick Howley","I think you are in the \u2013 whether it could be 0.5 one way or the other, I think you are in \u2013 I think it's in the noise level.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And one other cleanup one, just a clarification I guess. You mentioned you had agreement on some divestitures of $3 million, $4 million in sales \u2013 a $3 million, $4 million in EBITDA, what the sales corresponding to that?","Nick Howley","Let me \u2013 I think we probably \u2013 we have confidentiality agreements on that. I think I had probably said about as much as I can say.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","All right.","Nick Howley","But I think use the figure is around $3.5 million of EBITDA and you can probably figure they aren't the most profitable businesses in the world or we wouldn't be selling them.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right, okay. For that, that's good enough. And then one last one sorry if the stock option comp expenses trending higher here and I know obviously the EBITDA is growing, but what's the underlying rate we should expect for that stock comp expense on a go forward basis?","Greg Rufus","I haven't gone through the '13 guidance yet, but the reason it's going up is the combination of these acquisitions and issuing options and we value among there is the Black\u2013Scholes. So just to kind of put in perspective, in 2010 they were going for about $20 or is valued at about $20 a share. In '11, it was $35 a share. And this year in terms of the price of the stock, it's between $40 and $44. But let me remind, as you know, it's a non-cash charge, it's based on expensing stock options.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","All right. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please go ahead.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning David.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Last quarter, you guys gave guidance I think AmSafe EBITDA contribution this year, around $50 million. If I take what you said this time in terms of 51% EBITDA margins for the base business, and then dilution by about 3% from the acquisitions, it would imply that AmSafe is running better than kind of that $50 million, can you give an update to that number?","Nick Howley","I don't remember what the \u2013 do we give this guidance?","Greg Rufus","That would be on a GAAP basis, David, and that will (inaudible).","Nick Howley","As I said, the AmSafe businesses will \u2013 let me put the ground face to face aside for a minute. It looked like there we were doing as well. If not, as I said, a little better than we expected when we bought it. These are more happy legs.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Nick, where is that upside specifically coming from, is it pricing, or what are the value drivers, where are you seeing the upside?","Nick Howley","All. They say new business isn't ticking in yet, but we are doing reasonably well in pricing and we are also getting costs out pretty aggressively. Greg, how many plants have we cost? Four plus the corporate office?","Greg Rufus","Yeah. We closed the corporate office plus four facilities.","Nick Howley","Which is a lot of movement in six months.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Have you been able to reprice the entire business or what percent of the AmSafe was under LPAs that you haven't been able to address?","Nick Howley","I don't remember, but we haven't, we are not done yet.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Then my last question. Nick, you talked about that the aftermarket is not consistent and across your businesses you are seeing different things at different businesses. Can you give some additional color there, which businesses are kind of outperforming expectations, and which are underperforming specifically on the aftermarket front?","Nick Howley","Just the point I would like to make on that. What I expected to see, and this is to Carter's question at the beginning, I expected when we looked at the details, we see a more discretionary stuff, which is the minority of our products would be dropping off much more than rest of them. I don't see any consistency across that. The discretionary stuff is not, it was not reacting substantially different than the non-discretionary, which just says to me, [Myles], we're just sort of in a -- above the uncertain market. That's the only conclusion I draw from that now.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you for that question. The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","So, on the same topic that you have addressed, both in David's question and Carter's question, I don't know, maybe this is a question for Ray actually, but are you seeing in any categories, anything that would explain any categories or parts, the different growth rates we have seen so far in the result season, from the engine guys, versus the airframe guys, on the aftermarket. Is there something going on in the distribution channel for certain types of parts that you are not seeing elsewhere? Is there a cannibalization effect from parts, aircrafts? Anything you can help us with here?","Ray Laubenthal","Well, I would echo what Nick said before. We are not seeing any kind of panic.","Nick Howley","I see geographically, though it's hard to get the data exactly every quarter, but we have a decent idea. Obviously, the European market is worse than the others. So presumptively items that were used more heavily in that area, or probably down more, but I can't put a number around that. But it's hard, as you know across the world, sort of the economic situation is slowing down a little bit.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Do you see much evidence of cannibalization from that aircraft?","Ray Laubenthal","No.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Then Nick, on M&A, you mentioned activity is up. Are you seeing more targets in the pipeline, or is it more about the bid-ask spread narrowing? What's driving that?","Nick Howley","As of right now Rob, we are seeing more in the pipeline.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","How is pricing?","Nick Howley","I can't say, because they have been close. The real answer is, I am not sure. But my guess is, if things close, won't close, the price is substantially different than they did, than they had over the last year. Surely, just from the outside looking and watching other deals that have closed, they have still closed at pretty healthy prices.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Then just a couple of quick things. You mentioned a fair amount of activity, moving product lines around, reducing the number of plants. Is that driving the higher CapEx we saw in the quarter?","Greg Rufus","In the quarter especially, Ray mentioned the Kent facility, Schneller, we moved it in (inaudible).","Ray Laubenthal","They are putting out a couple of (inaudible), about 10,000 square feet, and want more and more.","Nick Howley","They are a significant (inaudible).","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","So how should the fourth quarter look on CapEx?","Nick Howley","Do we give guidance for CapEx? Not regularly.","Greg Rufus","I mean, we are not going to be way off from where we typically are.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Means you go back to where you were?","Greg Rufus","I mean, you think of 1.5 to 2 for the year, and at the high end of that, you will probably be pretty safe.","Robert Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning. On the defense side, another good quarter, and I think perhaps a few quarters ago, if someone had told you that your defense growth will be higher than your commercial aftermarket this quarter, you probably would have been a little surprised. So as you are looking for all that data in your process here, and you look business-by-business within the [sems], have you learned anything about why that continues to remain stronger than you would have expected?","Nick Howley","We kind of (inaudible) government spent more money than we expected. Our product lines are weighted towards helicopters and transports, and not so heavily towards Tigers and ground vehicles, we are really seeing a slower stuff, and they are just holding up better. They are continuing to buy parts and repair services at a rate more than we expected. But I am mostly focused around, I would say, probably helicopters first and the transport plane second.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Do you have a clear read-through in most of your businesses, as to whether it's aftermarket or OE that's driving it? I would imagine that's topical?","Nick Howley","Pretty clear. It sometimes gets a little more confused in the defense world than commercial, but generally pretty clear. I mean, the OEM rates don't change very quickly or very much and we know the (inaudible) content, so we can pretty well back in the production.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","It is really the aftermarket remaining a lot far.","Nick Howley","Absolutely.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Then just on some of the data you gave, Ray, I thought it was interesting on the platform-by-platform basis for the newer commercial platforms. Just a couple of questions on that. Those are pro forma numbers I imagine, including the say AmSafe and Schneller content on the legacy platforms?","Ray Laubenthal","Yeah, they are. I think I said in the script on a same store basis.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Clearly, listening to the lists, obviously it ran across all your businesses, platform by platform, but definitely it seems like a little heavy on some of the newer acquisitions, AmSafe and all of them. Schneller sounded like, if you had taken this measurement a year or two ago, would those increases have been as high or have you really targeted that via your acquisitions, is that a coincidence or not?","Nick Howley","In our prior year's Investor Days and so forth, we had given some of our -- an indication of how we were expanding our footprint. And really I didn't want to have the call go on for another half hour with me mentioning every product line. So we tried to pick kind of a cross section that wasn't heavy and either the new acquisitions are in the existing platforms, we just took a cross section.","There's many, many other product point applications I just didn't mention. I was just trying to add color there. But we've -- prior to these most recent acquisitions, we had very good success expanding our footprint and these acquisitions are no different.","Ray Laubenthal","Yeah, I would say -- to answer the, is it systematically or is it just (inaudible), we picked up good stuff on the acquisition vital, I'd like to say the commercials -- I believe it could be true also. The commercial stuff we have bought in the last year and a half has been good fresh product lines and they've cap up and they've been companies with cap up with their products, which means that cap up with decent positions on the new platforms.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Rama Bondada from the Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Rama Bondada \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Thank you. Starting on the margin side, it looks like on the legacy business, you've been able to mostly offset the margin dilution from the mix shift over the last couple of quarters here. If aftermarket remains at the current growth levels and you have these Boeing and Airbus production rates go up, do you think you can hold that EBITDA margins of about 50% for your legacy businesses?","Nick Howley","Can you say that again? If the OEM continues to grow faster than the aftermarket?","Rama Bondada \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Yeah, can you hold for these margins?","Nick Howley","Well, you'll get -- we'll give out the guidance for next year when we give it out. But I would say it would -- I would be surprised if the difference in growth rates next year between the two was enough to materially impact our margins?","Rama Bondada \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Okay. And on the M&A side, now that the UTX and Goodrich deal is closed, it looks like there are some parts of Goodrich that UTX is looking to dispose of. Can you just comment on the potential there for TransDigm, whether it fits in your criteria [in terms of acquisitions?","Nick Howley","","(Inaudible) the companies that we call in all the time to see what they have -- to see what they're having to sell. We've been following that for six or seven months and we're hopeful we can see some things from (inaudible) there, but it's too soon to tell.","Rama Bondada \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada","Okay, all right. Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning, everybody. A few part question on balance sheet utilization and capital deployment. So with the comments on the M&A pipeline picking up, I'm curious is there anything that's fairly late-stage there and it's just a matter of time to close or is it kind of just early in things popping their head up for the first time?","Secondly, at the Investor Day we started to get the sense that you were looking at a special dividend again maybe, is that something that's kind of still relatively on the table or not?","And then third part is, you talked about the net debt to EBITDA metric getting to 3:9 by the end of the year. I'm curious just what the current thinking is on how comfortable you are with that, whether or not that's floating with the suboptimal balance sheet that you referred to or not?","Nick Howley","Let me start. By the time I answer the first question, I probably would have forgotten the third, but I'll give it a try. On the acquisitions I would say we just don't comment -- we can't comment on that where they stand in the process (inaudible) we'll see what falls out. Sometimes things move fast, sometimes they all die and you end up with nothing. So I just -- I don't know how to handicap that now.","What was the next question? Was the next question on the special dividend? I would say, as I've said in the past, you see our leverage drop down into the 3s, it's getting into the kill zone for us. I would think [absent] any acquisitions of significance or if we look ahead, we think we don't see any pending. If it gets down into that area, we probably very seriously considered doing something with our capital structure.","Last winter, whenever -- November, December, we were almost in the throes of that and then this AmSafe came along and we -- and Harco together and so we had $850 million which is always our preference (inaudible). I mean we still believe that this is a company that should be leveraged. And letting the leverage drop down too low is not the way to optimize equity value. But it's a very fact and circumstance specific call.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. One follow-up on the aftermarket. Is the value-based pricing model not in any part of the business specifically, just broadly, is it even a little bit more difficult in a slower growth, generally tougher aftermarket environment or is it just still humming along as normal?","Nick Howley","I don't think it's substantially different. Obviously, you get more handwringing and (inaudible) mashing at people when the market's tough, but -- I mean the fundamental economics don't change.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just one last one for me. You [quoted] business jet and general aviation aftermarket growth was negative. Just curious what you think of that or what you're seeing or do you think that's strictly the comparison or do you think the business jet user and buyer is much more spooked now than they were three, six months ago, maybe tell us broadly what you're thinking about the business jet market?","Nick Howley","Yeah, first it's not a big number. It's down -- it's down modest (inaudible) volume steadily, so that was noteworthy to us. I suspect it's just part of the general economic concern and so [I think] little bit of a feeling in Malaysia right now, that's what I suspect that I don't know whether it's a one quarter phenomenon. If we see it for two or three quarters in a row, then we'll be getting a pretty good idea.","In the general aviation, which isn't a huge part of our business with impacts of a little, that comes to be impacted by [add gas] prices and [add gas] prices are pretty high for those propeller operators. But that's not new for me, that's been a phenomenon for a little while. But my overall guess is, is that we're just -- this is just part of the general economic concern we're seeing across things. I'm sure everyone else is seeing across a lot of industrial businesses.","Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Yes, thank you. Just two...","Nick Howley","Speak up, we can't hear you.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Yes, two quick questions please. Just following up on Noah's question about leverage, given where we are on the cycle and from the choppiness in the aftermarkets, do you have a different level of comfort with the amount of leverage you might put on, so -- would you be reluctant to go to the 5, 5.5 or 6 times debt to EBITDA and want to keep it five times or under or do you have any criteria that you can share with us, given the changing landscape?","Nick Howley","Yeah, I don't think we'd share a number. I would say all things being equal if we feel uncertain about the economy, the number would probably be a little [low] and we felt very good about the economy. But I don't know -- I don't -- in the numbers kind of ranges you've been talking about, I don't think any of those would concern us.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Okay. And could you also just talk about in the incoming order rates in the aftermarket in the fourth quarter, have you seen any discernable change in pattern just in the month and a week we've had since the close of the quarter, have things deteriorated sequentially? Have they got stabilized sequentially? And is there any trend that you can draw?","Nick Howley","I can't really speak to that. I can't really to speak to that, this one.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Okay. Could you talk -- I mean when you think about the fourth quarter, is there -- are you looking for sequential aftermarket stability or you expecting that to rise a bit year-on-year?","Nick Howley","Well, I think we gave you the number. We expect the -- we gave you guidance for the year, of aftermarket of 8 to 10, so if you put the middle point 9 say, that would imply a 7% quarter-over-quarter growth from fourth quarter to fourth quarter.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Okay, so I see that here. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Carter Leake (BB&T Capital Markets).","Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets","Nick, let me follow-up on that. If I put in -- this is commercial aftermarket growth, if I put in the 8% to 10% number for sequential growth I get either down minus 4% or up 3%. Does that make sense to you?","Nick Howley","(Inaudible) math, I didn't do the sequential, I did the quarter-over-quarter. I just don't -- and it's math, you'd figure it out. It is what it is.","Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets","Well, I just wondered so could -- fourth quarter could we see a decline as much of -- as sort of 4%, that would hit an 8% full year number based on what we've gotten. Is that something that you could see and fourth quarter could be down that much?","Nick Howley","I think we gave you the ranges 8% to 10%. So whatever that works out to, that's what we think the [band] is.","Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets","All right. You won't be selling AmSafe. Was that in -- I assume that was not in any guidance, was it?","Nick Howley","AmSafe's what?","Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets","You had said you won't be selling AmSafe ground piece?","Nick Howley","It was included in our GAAP numbers.","Greg Rufus","It's always been\u2026","Nick Howley","It's always been in our GAAP numbers. The ground transportation business has always been in our numbers.","Greg Rufus","It's in our go-forward numbers and there's no cash -- no, we're not assuming any cash from the sale.","Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Moving to the platforms that you gave us, I appreciate the color. I just want to clear up a couple of things. When you speak about the aircraft and the engine content, you do single out Rolls. Perhaps I should know this but do you only have igniters on rolls power, is that\u2026?","Nick Howley","No we haven't made -- our igniter (inaudible) GE, basically there's two suppliers in igniters and ignition systems. Ourselves and Unison, GE owns Unison, so that we tend to get Rolls work, we tend to get the Pratt work and we tend GE, on new platforms they tend to get it. Now on historical platforms like the CFM56, that's a situation where we're dual-sourced. So we share the aftermarket, on the CFM56. And each GE engines gave us a little bit of different sweat between it.","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","And then when you were signing these platforms you were signing large content increase for example A380 up 90%, versus I think it's sort of prior platforms, what would be the prior platform we'd be using a long.","Nick Howley","We make \u2013 when we do this, we track this from a \u2013 we start a program. On a program restructuring, we start investing in it. We make an estimate on what we think it will replace, so maybe with that when we might say, if it takes a job it will replace three quarters of a 747, and one quarter of a A338 \u2013 340 or something like that. So we make some weighted index, and then we hold it consistent. In that way we calculate what our base chipset content is, weight it that way, and then we keep measuring it as we go forward.","And now A380, there's a little bit of a disconnect there. Because you've got more seats, but even if you were \u2013 right the if you have 90% more content doesn't mean you have 90% more content per seat or per body in the plane. But even if you adjust for that, you're still \u2013I want to say if you just remember seats, I want to say, [Ray], you're still up 40% or something like that.","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah.","Nick Howley","Did you follow what I mean there?","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah, well but I.","Nick Howley","If you take airplanes so everything was perfect, you had more dollars on it. And you can see in some of the literature, where people will plot the number of seats versus the range of the aircraft. And it's a scatter diagram of all the Boeing and Airbus aircraft. And we kind of look at that scatter diagram and we say, geez what airplanes -- predecessor airplanes are kind of plotted around that aircraft its replacing. And you can get quite academic on how you're going to weight them. But we \u2013 we basically put a stake in the ground, we kind of \u2013 try and measure consistently.","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","And these numbers \u2013 787 up 60% versus whoever thought it would a be a 767 or whatever, is this volume you're telling us or you're telling us it's dollar-based.","Nick Howley","Dollars per aircraft.","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay.","Nick Howley","So they're selling one whatever \u2013 let's say it was 100% replacement on the 747, which it's not. Not a way, it's an index. You know we're saying if we have $100 on that we'll have a $190 on the 380 as it goes out.","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","And then if I look at some of this content is there -- because some of the composites, it's nice but it doesn't seem I wouldn't think it would have as much aftermarket as say, igniters. Are you telling us these figures today to sort of speak to top-line growth, because this is attractive to that end but it also could have some dilutive impact in here?","Nick Howley","I wouldn't draw any conclusion on that.","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay.","Nick Howley","We don't see any reason that the mix \u2013 that the mix of parts that we \u2013 the way we look at is if \u2013 we think the mix of parts that are going on a platform and we sort of run it out for \u2013 sort of a mature point when there's a reasonable aftermarket we want to be sure that we still got 50% EBITDAs and more. We don't see anything significantly different here.","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","That's okay.","Nick Howley","Okay, so we \u2013 we didn't as Ray said, we didn't go through everything, we tried to kind of highlight the stuff we thought was a little different and we hadn't talked about before.","You know if we have 40,000 ER system, he didn't get through all the 14 valves and that sort of thing.","Carter Leake \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, the next question we have comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Ciarmoli \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, good afternoon, guys thanks for taking the question. Nick, I guess you know, with your defense exposure, you're clearly not as exposed as some of the other players in the space, but how are you guys going to handle, the impact of sequestration when you give your year '13 outlook?","Nick Howley","You'll just have to wait till we give the '13 outlook. I \u2013 we're going to collect data and we'll make our best guess when we get there. I mean you know, we our shifts, we know what shifts we're on we know what the aftermarket demand is by different platforms, we'll keep gathering information and we'll do the best we can when we get there. If is -- truth is I don't know.","Michael Ciarmoli \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Fair enough, and then most of mine have been answered just if I look at \u2013 your passenger traffic growth assumptions for the year 4.5% I think the recent data implies IDA saying we're annualizing at 2% growth. Should we look at that correlation, you're 4.5% this year that aligns with your midpoint on aftermarket essentially 9%, is that a good multiplier to use, if we're assuming growth next year, might be 3% to 4%, can we use that as a good proxy for your expected effort?","Nick Howley","I don't know.","Michael Ciarmoli \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","You don't know?","Nick Howley","I don't know. I think I said 4% and 4.50% by the way. In the range of 4% to 4.50%. I don't have a good feel for that.","Michael Ciarmoli \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, perfect, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of J. B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Hey, guys thanks for taking my call. I think you pretty much addressed, how you're looking at channel inventory and that kind of thing. But is there \u2013 different product lines, we can sort of look through the list, it's pretty diverse of \u2013 some products that are \u2013 more heavily inventoried than other and maybe more subject to \u2013 some drawdown, if perhaps there was a lower capacity may have some growth next year.","Nick Howley","Yes, the answer is yes, there are \u2013 as I sit here I don't think I can come up with a list for you. The ones that go through distribution probably are a little more risk, because they have two levels of inventory. You know, you've got distribution level and an airline level. But I don't have a good sense of how much that is. ","J. B. Groh \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","So when we think about that \u2013 what percentage of your product go through distribution and what -- how much is what percent is for direct?","Nick Howley","I want to say, if you take the commercial aftermarket something a little under half I think goes to distribution.","J. B. Groh \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, that's helpful.","Nick Howley","But, even that \u2013 depending on the product they have different stocking requirements, you know, some have very low stocking requirements, some have longer ones, depending on lead times and thing like that. But as a general rule that's probably a little more susceptible to fluctuation than the ones that aren't.","J. B. Groh \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great, okay. And did I miss the backlog number, or is that just show up in the Q?","Greg Rufus","We show it just in the K.","Ray Laubenthal","In the K, yeah.  ","J. B. Groh \u2013 D.A.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Ma'am, the podium is yours.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2017 fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.

Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release or a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning. Today, I'll start off as always with some comments about our consistent strategy. I'll then give a quick summary of 2017, a quick review of the guidance for 2018. Kevin will then review the key operational and market details for both years and Terry will run through the financials for both years. We have a fair amount to cover here today.","Again to restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and over three quarters of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales have historically produced the higher gross margin and have provided relative stability in the downturns. Our longstanding goal is to give our shareholders private equity like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation, as well as the careful management of our balance sheet.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Two, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology based on our three value driver-concepts. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation issue or a system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. Fourthly, we acquire businesses that fit with our focused strategy and where we see a clear path, the PE like returns and lastly we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value.","As you know we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you again, we basically have four and our priorities are typically as follows. First, invest in our existing businesses. Second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy and return requirements. These two are almost always our first choice. Third, give any extra back to the shareholders, either through special dividends or stock buybacks. And lastly, pay off debt, but given the low cost of capital especially after tax this is still likely our last choice in current capital market conditions.","In the last three years, we've seen three different business conditions and related examples of how we manage our capital allocation. In 2015 and 2016, we saw a number of attractive acquisition opportunities, we acquired about $3 billion of proprietary aerospace businesses that met our strategic and shareholder return criteria.","In fiscal 2017 attractive acquisition candidates were few and far between. Given the continuing attractive credit markets and a sharp, but short drop in our share price, we chose to allocate about $3 billion of our capital to return to the shareholders. We did this through both special dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks.","In summary, over the last three years, that is since the beginning of fiscal year 2015, we have returned about $3.2 billion to our shareholders. In that same period, we acquired about $3.2 billion of proprietary aerospace businesses. We've fully invested our existing businesses. We kept a healthy cash balance and maintained significant dry powder for additional acquisitions. We'll see what 2018 brings but as we've done consistently in the past depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders.","Now, to summarize 2017. 2017 was a busy year. In spite of some distractions in the first half of the year, we kept our eye on the ball. The company exceeded the midpoint of our original EBITDA As Defined guidance from our base businesses by about 1% while revenues were about 1% lower than our original guidance. Versus the midpoint of our most recent guidance revenues were a bit lower. Most of this was the result of moving SCHROTH revenue to discontinued operations. There was also a modest timing shortfall in some commercial OEM shipments.","On the other hand, on the same basis, EBITDA was a bit higher than our recent midpoint guidance. On the same-store basis versus prior year on a full year basis, OEM revenue was about flat. Commercial aftermarket revenues were up in the low to mid single-digits and defense was up close to the mid single-digits. Kevin will expand and give you a little more color on this.","Our GAAP revenues for fiscal year 2017 were up 10.5% versus the prior year. In general, commercial revenue growth was a little less than we expected and defense revenue growth was a little better. All in all, pretty close.","EBITDA As Defined was up 14% versus fiscal year 2016, margins expanded versus the prior year with minimal overall dilution impact from acquisitions. On a less positive note, though no HSR filing was required before the close, the Department of Justice challenged our SCHROTH seatbelt and restraint acquisition. After some discussion with the DoJ given the small size of the deal, the unusual situation in our uniquely substantial position in aerospace seatbelts and restraints, we decided to sell the business and avoid any protracted dispute.","We have identified a buyer and in the process of finalizing the arrangement. We do not anticipate any go forward impact on our overall acquisition strategy. You'll see in our 10-K about $3 million of SCHROTH -related EBITDA was moved to discontinued operations. We will have a loss on the sale though in the overall picture wont' be financially material.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue actively looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is reasonably active. We've looked at a number of opportunities recently. Closings are always difficult to predict, but we will remain disciplined and focused on the value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Moving on now to guidance for fiscal year 2018. As we head into 2018, we continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. However, flight hours and the commercial transport plane backlog in the industry continue to look very positive, which gives us some comfort, but we remain cautious and we're ready to move quickly if the situation changes.","For fiscal year 2018, as usual we've given a range around the key financial metrics like revenue EBITDA As Defined, EPS as defined. As long as our full year outlook continues to be in the range, we don't intend to adjust our guidance quarterly. Based on the above and assuming no acquisitions in fiscal year 2018, the midpoint of our guidance is as follows. The midpoint of the fiscal year 2018 revenue is $3.69 billion or up 5% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. This is almost all organic growth.","As in the past years, Q1 of fiscal year 2018, the revenues are anticipated to be lower than the other three quarters. As a percent of revenue, Q1 revenue looks about the same percent of the total as the prior year's Q1. The midpoint of fiscal year 2018 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.83 billion, the range is a 6% to 9% growth versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. Currency impacts as you know are generally immaterial. We do anticipate that margins will move up throughout the year as we've seen in the previous year with Q1 being the lowest and the move should be roughly in line with the prior year.","2017 acquisitions were modest. So the EBITDA growth like the revenue growth is almost all organic. The midpoint of EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $0.13 a share, up 6% versus the prior year. Terry will go through the details with you on that.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following growth rate, commercial OEM revenue growth in the mid-single digit percent, commercial aftermarket revenue in the mid-single-digit percent with the commercial transport aftermarket a little higher than that, and the business jet and helicopter revenues about flat in the aftermarket. So difficult to quantify exactly, we still believe the commercial transport aftermarket demand is impacted somewhat by the high number and utilization of five-year and younger aircrafts. Defense and military revenue growth should be up in the low to mid single-digits. Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity we expect to generate about $900 million in cash from operations.","In fiscal year 2017, for a number of reasons, we gave considerable additional detail on our various submarket sections, especially in the commercial aftermarket. Kevin will close out fiscal year 2017 with some color on these subsections. However, we do not intend to continue to give the level of additional detail. Through fiscal year 2018, we'll comment quarterly if the subsections look materially different than we originally indicated.","In summary, 2017 was a good and a busy year. I'm confident with our consistent value focus strategy and the strong mix of our business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors.","And now, let me hand it to Kevin, who'll expand a bit on 2017 and 2018.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. As you've seen, Q4 fiscal year 2017 was a strong quarter operationally and for that matter, all of 2017, which had some significant challenges shaped into another good year.","Now, let's review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide color commentary on a pro forma basis versus prior year of 2016. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket.","In our commercial OEM market, revenues were about flat, when compared with Q4 of fiscal year 2016 and is similarly about flat year-over-year. Commercial transport OEM revenues which make up most of our commercial OEM revenues were up about 1% versus prior year Q4 and by a similar amount for the year.","As we explained last quarter, inventory management by our OEM customers, much of which appears due to rate reductions on wide-body platforms or simply slower ramp ups on new wide-body platforms have created headwinds in the commercial OEM market. So, 2017 was an up and down year for commercial transport OEM bookings, but at the core no significant changes in ship set content have occurred. So any softness is simply timing related. Speaking of ship set content and in reference to a program that has been in the press recently, the Bombardier CSeries is an interesting program for the future as our ship set content is significantly greater on this platform than current narrow-body platforms.","For business jet and helicopter OEM revenues, which make up about 15% of our commercial OEM revenues, revenues in this market were down mid single-digits in Q4 and by a similar percent for the year as overall global business jet market demand has not consistently improved. Q4 bookings were up modestly and brought the year end flat with 2016 in bookings. Key design wins have positioned TransDigm for growth in the future in this section with platforms such as Cessna Longitude, General Dynamics G500, G600 and Bombardier Global 7000, 8000.","Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by just under 5% in the quarter and brought the year up to about 3% revenue growth. Bookings, which can be lumpy on a quarterly basis, expanded faster than sales in 2017, and provide some comfort for fiscal year 2018.","Now let me provide a little color on our commercial aftermarket business and the submarket segments. We had previously offered additional information on our submarkets to help better explain our commercial aftermarket business. Going forward, we will no longer provide this additional information unless it changes materially from our expectations.","As we have discussed recently, we split the total commercial aftermarket into four pieces in an effort to provide some additional color and clarity on this important market for TransDigm. Commercial transport passenger aftermarket revenue is the largest market segment in our commercial aftermarket revenue at about 60% of sales. For the current quarter this slice of the commercial aftermarket business grew by mid single-digits, when compared with the same quarter in fiscal year 2016. And for the year have expanded by upper single-digits, roughly in-line with our previously reported three-year average for this submarket.","For the commercial transport interiors aftermarket, which accounts for about 10% of our total commercial aftermarket revenue, Q4 revenues declined significantly and by a similar mid-teen decline in the fiscal year. This discretionary interiors market has had a very difficult year-to-date after experiencing robust growth year-over-year for the last three years.","Softness in this market appears due to a decline in various fleet refurbishment projects, not unlike others who have recently reported in this space. Although we continue to win refurbishment and repair orders for the future, recent push outs have challenged this submarket. To-date, we have seen no appreciable changes in our market share in these businesses.","For the commercial transport freight aftermarket, which accounts for about 15% of our average revenues in total commercial aftermarket, Q4 demonstrated strong growth year-over-year and helped drive a second half of the year recovery in revenue growth, finishing fiscal year 2017 up mid single-digits. This is encouraging, as it would appear the freight aftermarket is finally showing signs of a recovery. Our proprietary Telair products continue strong performance and our non-proprietary containers and nets businesses have begun to stabilize.","Finally for the business jet helicopter aftermarket, which accounts for the final 15% of revenue of our total commercial aftermarket, sales were down low single-digits in Q4 of fiscal year 2017 and by a similar amount for the fiscal year of 2017.","Year-to-date, our bookings are about flat with the same period a year ago. There is some indication that this market could improve in the future, given business jet takeoff and landing cycles improvement in recent quarters, but as of yet we are not seeing any recovery. The aftermarket in this segment tends to go through the OEM, and as such, we do not have the same insight into this piece of the market.","So to summarize on our total commercial aftermarket, the passenger segment demonstrated continued strength. The freight segment now showing some solid signs of recovery for all our business units. Our discretionary interiors markets have shown no clear signs of recovery, but do appear to be stabilizing. And finally, the business jet helicopter favorable usage metrics are not yet translating into revenue growth.","Now let me touch on our defense market, which remains relatively unchanged at about a third of our total revenue. The defense market, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, which were up modestly versus prior year Q4 and demonstrated a clear improvement of about 4% growth for the year, a solid story in both OEM and aftermarket segments of the defense market.","Previously in the year this strength was due to only a few businesses, but as the year has come to a close, revenue strength appears to be coming from most businesses in the total defense segment for TransDigm.","Total defense bookings continue to provide an encouraging narrative, as bookings have expanded for fiscal year 2017. Fiscal year 2017 OEM bookings have been bolstered significantly by large multi-year new product bookings for Whippany Actuation Systems on a confidential platform and for Airborne Systems parachute business. As always, lumpy bookings and shipments like these are common in the defense market and caution must be used in forecasting off of a few data points.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis, Terry will provide more detail on the numbers, but let me touch on operating margin for TransDigm. The EBITDA As Defined margin came in at about 49% of revenues for fiscal year 2017, an improvement year-over-year of almost 2 percentage points. This represents a significant accomplishment for the company and indicates that our base business continues to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers and our 2016 acquisitions continue to integrate into TransDigm.","Finally, as a statement about our value driver strategy and specifically our ability to capture profitable new business wins in the market, TransDigm was once again named to the Forbes 2017 World's Most Innovative Companies list, an important recognition of our performance and our unique business model in the industry.","So let me conclude on 2017 by stating all-in-all fiscal year 2017 was another solid year for TransDigm, focused on our value drivers of profitable new business productivity and value pricing. And the successful integration of our acquisitions made in 2016 have allowed us to deliver another year of outstanding value generation.","Now let me touch briefly on some details for our 2018 plan guidance. For 2018, we have the following guidance. Commercial OEM revenues are estimated to grow in the mid single-digit range, as wide-body production rates and related OEM inventory needs stabilize with continued narrow body build rate strength and business jet and helo OEM demand remaining flat.","Commercial aftermarket revenues for 2018, we guide to expand by mid single-digits with our aforementioned commercial aftermarket submarkets performing as follows. Commercial transport passenger expands at a mid-to-high single digit range, roughly in line with previous trends for TransDigm. Commercial transport interiors expands at flat-to-low single digits for 2018. It appears that this market has begun to stabilize for us with some recent opportunities for discretionary interior designs for a number of global regional airlines. Commercial transport freight expands at mid-to-high single digits as the freight market and demand for spare parts continues to grow after a number of years of below-average performance. Both proprietary and non-proprietary products should participate in this expansion.","Finally, for the business jet helicopter aftermarket, we see a largely flat market, as we expect some aftermarket improvements in business jet to counter continued helo softness.","For the total defense market, we are guiding to growth in the low to mid single-digit range. We see defense aftermarket outpacing OEM growth, although both are positive, as replacing depleted military spare parts and any maintenance backlog provide an opportunity.","As always, we will focus on our value drivers in 2018 with a number of productivity projects involving plants, consolidation opportunities on the horizon from 2017 acquisitions and routine maintenance of our production footprint. This, along with continued emphasis on new products and innovation and value pricing opportunities, will once again be our focus for 2018.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. Before I review the quarterly results, I wanted to give a little color on the financial statement impacts of the SCHROTH divestiture.","The income statement activity has been excluded from all line items and condensed to a new line item in the income statement labeled loss from discontinued operations net of tax. This loss of $32 million is primarily the result of the estimated selling price of SCHROTH being at a lower price than when we acquired the business, partially offset by modest operating income after purchase accounting adjustments during the seven months we owned the business.","Nick already summarized the key events that occurred in fiscal year 2017, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal yearend summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal 2018.","Fourth quarter net sales excluding $10.1 million from discontinued operations were $924 million, up $49 million, or approximately 6% greater than prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions of Tactair, Young & Franklin and the three product lines contributed $26 million of additional sales for the period. Organic sales were up just under 3% for the quarter.","Our fourth quarter gross profit was $531 million, an increase of 10%. Our reported gross profit margin of 57.5% was over two margin points higher than the prior year primarily due to the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure and lowering non-operating acquisition-related costs.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.4% of sales for the current quarter, compared to 12.7% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock compensation, SG&A was 10.3% of sales in both current year and prior year quarter.","We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $17 million, up 12% versus the prior year quarter. This is a result of an increase on our weighted average total debt to $11.5 billion in the current quarter.","During the quarter, we completed the issuance of $1.8 billion of term loans and drew $100 million on our accounts receivable securitization facility. The proceeds were used together with cash on hand to repay $1.2 billion of our existing tranche C term loans and to fund $22 per share special dividend.","Also during the quarter we entered into a new interest rate swap to hedge our exposure to the variable rate of the new term loans including all interest rate swaps and caps approximately 75% of our debt remains fixed or capped.","Now moving on to taxes. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 25.6% in the current quarter compared to 26% in the prior year. Our full-year GAAP effective rate is 24.9% compared to 23.7% in the prior year. The higher rate in the current year is primarily due to foreign discrete benefits that were in the prior year that did not recur in 2017. As a reminder, our GAAP tax rate now generally approximate our cash tax rate during an entire fiscal year due to the accounting treatment for excess tax benefits, for share-based payments including stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments. Excluding the excess tax benefits, our 2017 effective tax rate is 30.5%, the same rate we use for our full-year adjusted EPS.","Our net income from continuing operations for the quarter increased $29 million, or 19% to $184 million, which is 19.9% of sales. This compares to net income of $155 million, or 17.7% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales versus the prior period, improvements to our operating margin and lower acquisition related costs, partially offset with higher interest expense. Net loss from discontinued operations in the quarter was $30.7 million, or $0.56 loss per share.","GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.21 per share in the current quarter, compared to $2.70 per share last year. The current quarter was significantly impacted by the $63 million at dividend equivalent payments, or $1.15 per share paid in the quarter due to the $22 per share dividend paid in September. Our adjusted EPS was $3.48 per share, an increase of 6% compared to $3.29 per share last year. Please reference table 3 in this morning's press release which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Since this is our fiscal yearend, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some of the significant items for the year. Net sales excluding $24.6 million from discontinued operations increased $333 million, or by 10.5% to our year-end of $3.5 billion in revenues. Acquisitions contributed $256 million of the increase in sales, organic sales growth was 2.4%.","Reported gross profit increased 15% to $1.98 billion and was 56.6% of sales compared to 54.5% in the prior year, improving over 2 margin points. Selling and administrative expenses of 11.9% of sales in fiscal year 2017 is slightly lower than the 12.1% of sales in fiscal year 2016.","Again, excluding all acquisition-related expenses, stock compensation and non-operating expenses, SG&A was about 10.5% of sales compared to 9.9% of sales last year. The higher SG&A was primarily related to higher selling and admin expenses of our recent acquisitions. Net interest expense increased $119 million, up 25% versus the prior year. This is a result of the increase in our weighted average total debt to about $11 billion from $8.8 billion in the prior year. Fiscal year 2017 weighted average cash interest rate was 5.3%. The average LIBOR rate was approximately 1% for the full year. Adjusted EPS was $12.38 per share, up 8% from $11.49 from last year.","Now, switching gears to cash and liquidity. The company generated $789 million of cash from operating activities. We closed the year with $651 million of cash on the balance sheet and have over $1 billion of liquidity available to us with our undrawn revolver and our capacity under our credit agreement. The company's gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the year was approximately 6.9 times pro-forma EBITDA and 6.5 times pro forma EBITDA on a net basis.","Fiscal year 2017 was another good year for TransDigm and our shareholders. As we look forward to fiscal year 2018, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP EPS to be $11.93, as Nick previously mentioned we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $13.10. As we disclosed on slide 10, there are $1.17 in adjustments to bridge the GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $130 million compared to $118 million in fiscal year 2017. Interest expense is expected to be around $650 million in fiscal year 2018. This estimate reflects the financing completed in Q4 and includes both cash interest and approximately $25 million of amortization of debt issue costs and fees. This estimate assumes an average LIBOR rate of 1.3% for the full year which then yields a weighted average cash interest rate of approximately 5.3%.","In our materials we provided this morning is an interest rate sensitivity table that you can use to do sensitivity analysis on the LIBOR rate. Just as an example if LIBOR were to increase to 3%, our weighted average interest rate would increase approximately 0.5% to just under 6%. This would increase our interest expense by approximately $65 million, or around $45 million on an after tax basis.","Our effective tax rate for adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2018 is expected to be around 31% and the GAAP rate between 25% and 28%. The main difference in the rates is the estimated benefit on fiscal year 2018 stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments, that will be recorded as a discrete adjustment through the quarters as options are exercised.","The timing of the exercises is difficult to predict, but as they occur, we will reduce our GAAP tax rate along with our cash taxes. We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will increase very slightly, there will be approximately 55.6 million shares assuming no buybacks occur during the year. As a result of these items, our adjusted EPS of $13.10 is approximately 6% greater than fiscal year 2017.","In regards to our liquidity and leverage, assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we expect to have around $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of cash on hand at the end of fiscal year 2018. This includes an estimate for CapEx of around 2% of our sales. Assuming no other acquisition activity our net leverage ratio will be between 5.6 times and 5.8 times our EBITDA As Defined at September 30, 2018.","We currently have adequate capacity to make over a $1 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity. This capacity grows steadily to over $3 billion as the year proceeds. I would also like to discuss a couple other items before we open up for Q&A. As you all know the House Ways and Means Committee released a proposed tax bill last week. We are currently evaluating and we know that there will be changes as it progresses through the congressional process. Our preliminary high level analysis would indicate our cash tax rate would not materially change from where it is today and maybe slightly lower.","Finally, our term-loans have been trading above par for a while and we are in the beginning stages of re-pricing some of our term-loans to reduce our interest expense. We will only proceed if it makes economic sense as we go-to-market. As we finalize this endeavor, we'll provide an update to our full year interest guidance and an updated interest sensitivity data. With that now, I'll hand it over to Liza for Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you. Operator, we're now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Sir, your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey guys, good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey. Welcome to the new firm.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Thanks, Nick. Two questions for you. One, with SCHROTH, what changed in the evaluation there. I mean, obviously, when you bought it, you have the AmSafe business which has a pretty high market share in seat belts. I just wondered, what was it that you learned or in response to the DoJ that changed that evaluation there. Because coming in you definitely already had a pretty \u2013 you must have had a firm view to begin with?","And then the second question just relates to the 2018 guidance, the freight portion of that guide. I mean, clearly it looks like you were up north of 20% in the fourth quarter. So, was there something one-time in that, because I would assume that would carry through into next year's guidance which was significantly below that. So just trying to square those two together? Thanks.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, Carter. Let me talk about the SCHROTH thing, and then Kevin, why don't you talk about the freight after we get this done here. As I'm thinking though, this didn't require an HSR review. Essentially we went through the analysis before we bought it. We thought it was okay. The DoJ probably from someone contacted them started to question it, they took a different view of the way we defined the market segments. I don't know that we agree with that view, but at the end of the day given the size of the deal and sort of the uniqueness of the situation as I said in the restraint world, we just decided it wasn't worth dragging this out, and we thought it was just more prudent to sell it and move on.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's how it came about.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kevin, on the freight.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","On freight, we forecast for fiscal year 2018 mid to high single-digits on the commercial transport freight. You're right, we had a very strong Q4. I suspect some of that might have been catch up, but I think we're being conservative and the concern remains that to what extent will the non-proprietary piece participate in that. But clearly freight is an important sector for us in 2018 and looks pretty good as we forecast mid to high.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Kevin, how much of that business is that non-proprietary piece?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's a reasonable chunk of the business.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, it's a reasonable size. We don't disclose the individual pieces, but it's a reasonable chunk of that 15% of the commercial aftermarket.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But, I think to say it's not half just to be clear.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, it's not half.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's not half, but, yeah.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","First one is really a clarification. I think you said that the cash tax rate you didn't anticipate would change under the new bill. Is that a net basis after including the various pieces and puts and takes inclusive of a corporate tax rate drop from 35% to 20%, you still wouldn't get a net cash tax benefit?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, Myles. That's right. What I think I said on the \u2013 what I meant to say just to clarify is that we think our cash tax position will be very similar to where we're at today as we looked at 2017 and recast on the new fees or maybe slightly lower. So what's happening is, obviously, the impact of the interest deductibility limitations has an impact to us, but the lower rate on the rest of the taxable income is beneficial to us. So we think we're going to be right about where we're at today from a rate standpoint.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then the other one, just a clarification, the $900 million you said in cash from operations, that's for fiscal 2018. It's almost a one-for-one match on incremental EBITDA. So what is benefiting you as you move into 2018 from a either working capital or a cash tax basis?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's from a \u2013 cash from operations we're looking at $900 million. I think that's from a cash tax standpoint, the rate is going to be consistent. We're in the range that we took before.","We'll see some of our interest costs go up. And then the CapEx is around 2% of sales, so our free cash flow number should be in the low-$800s million to mid-$800s million for the year. So I'm not seeing anything unusual other than the growth in our EBITDA to be honest with you.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. But I mean it's a one-for-one growth usually, but obviously you've got higher interest and usually your conversion of EBITDA to operating cash flow is about 50%. So I'm just curious, I mean obviously it's a better working capital performance.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think the interest expense is going to be \u2013 it'll take that 50% down a little bit this year on the conversion, but that will drive it. And then we are going to see a little bit benefit of working capital from where we were this year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just a last one on SCHROTH. Nick, what's the ability for look backs for deals in your past? I mean is there a statute of limitations, timeline, is there anything like that? And then how comfortable are you that this is kind of a one-off situation? Or do you have to put a scrubber to the deals in the pipeline a little bit harder going forward?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I don't \u2013 I'd \u2013 so I have no idea what the look back rule is. But I would just \u2013 Myles, this is a pretty unique situation. If you look at the \u2013 if you look at sort of our position in the seatbelt restraint market, it's pretty unique compared to our other products. We rarely see significant overlap when we buy anything. I think this is a one-off kind of thing.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know of any exposure in the back. Surely I haven't heard of any, no one's said anything about it.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Sir, your line is now open.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Nick, I just wanted to follow-up on that comment. So is it fair to assume that SCHROTH hasn't had any sort of impact on your screening or as you look at potential M&A activity or opportunities?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It has not so far, and I don't \u2013 I would say it's probably unlikely we'd try and buy a seatbelt business. Fortunately or unfortunately, there are hardly any out there. So it doesn't much matter. But it's business as usual. As I said, this is a very unusual situation. There's a set of facts here in sort of the substantive market position we have here.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, okay. No, I can appreciate that. I just wanted to follow-up. You started the call off with sort of commenting on sort of the broad picture in terms of the environment that enabled some of the M&A activity a few years ago.","I guess my question would be, as you look moving forward, you still comment on a fairly robust pipeline. But are you looking, in particular have you placed any different priorities on markets you're perhaps looking at when you look at defense versus commercial, either OE or aftermarket?","And then as a second part of that, are you seeing anything that might have changed just in availability of assets that might explain part of the lower recent activity? Or is it just normal lumpiness that we should expect on the M&A front?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's normal lumpiness. I can say most people I talk to tell me, there wasn't a whole lot in 2017 in sort of the size we did. Of course, there was one big mega-buy.","Our criteria hasn't changed. Proprietary aerospace, significant aftermarket. I would say we see more defense stuff now than we used to see. Just as you probably know, defense valuations are higher than they were. And people that had been holding defense stuff that want to sell it are more inclined to try and sell it now.","So if you look at the list of things we see, it's probably more heavily weighted towards defense than it maybe was two years, three years ago. But I have no way of predicting whether that's how they'll close or whether they'll make sense to us. I will say the activity, just the number of things we've looked at, and sort of the list is reasonably robust.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, great. And just finally, your preference for assets by market hasn't changed, whether it be defense or commercial?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think so. I don't think so. You know our requirement, proprietary, significant aftermarket, PE kind of return, which you know how we define that. I mean, those are the big, big screens.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. All right. Well, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a real quick follow-up on that M&A question. Are you seeing any properties that you were interested in just go to other buyers, whether you're missing out on price or something else? Or is it just you're not seeing the ones that meet your criteria?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I don't \u2013 look I hate to say never, but I can't think of anything, Matt, that we wanted that we didn't get, that we wanted to go after, which basically says in the last \u2013 through 2017, we just didn't see good things of any magnitude that we wanted to buy.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think that answers your question. I wouldn't say \u2013 it's not that we wanted to buy company A and we got outbid. That's not what it is.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're not seeing that.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, okay. Got it. And then, Kevin, you had a pretty optimistic assessment of your defense markets right now. And could you square that with the guidance for low-to-mid single-digit growth next year? Just what's visibility in that market? It seems like there's a lot of activity there, and I don't know if you're being conservative on the outlook. Or what's your visibility on the defense side?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we always try to be appropriately conservative. But, yeah, there is good activity. There is a lot of requests for quote. There is a lot of quoting activity around the ranch, but it's always difficult to predict. And there's external factors with budgets and the like that impact defense.","So versus our historical guidance, the up low-to-mid single digits is higher than usual. And that's where we stand with it, with the visibility that we have. Again, things can be lumpy in the defense business and hard to predict.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hello.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Hi, good morning, everyone.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sorry, classic mute-button mistake. Nick, so the revenue guidance looks to imply 3% to 5% organic. It's a little light of kind of your long-run normalized pace of growth. I'd really kind of have to be at the very low-end of how you define each end market to be at 3% for the total company. I guess, I'm just sort of wondering, if you decided to put extra contingency in the revenue guidance this year, given some of the choppiness and some things you experienced last year.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I guess another way of asking that is do you think we're conservative in our guidance, right, in the revenue.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Well, I know you always are, so I guess the question is actually whether you're incrementally so compared to normal.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I don't know how to answer that because we give guidance that we want to give, but I would say we surely don't think we're extra aggressive here.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Maybe I'll just leave it that. Otherwise no, I'm going to end up giving another guidance number.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. I know, I...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hopefully we don't believe we're aggressive here in these ranges.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's fair enough. I guess the question was more sort of if you just took any different approach after what happened last year with some of the unexpected things in the aftermarket and the like, but I appreciate the nature of the rest (49:55).","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","The organic growth, I think the organic last year was about 2.5%.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","This is essentially all organic now...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So there's almost no acquisition impact year-over-year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Right, right. Okay. Can you tell us how orders in both the commercial aerospace aftermarket and the defense aftermarket compared to revenue in the quarter and the year for 2017?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kevin, you talked about the year, didn't you? I just don't see them in the quarter (50:33).","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. So your question was on defense aftermarket or total defense business versus...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Looking at back...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Basically trying to get bookings compared to revenues through a book-to-bill...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You mean like a book \u2013 no, you're asking like a book-to-bill...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Book-to-bill ratio, yeah, which I think you've given in the past a few times and I'm specifically curious for defense aftermarket and commercial aftermarket, if you had it for defense OE as well that would be helpful, too?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Let me check. If you took a book-to-bill in the defense I would say it's up pretty modestly. I would say in the commercial aftermarket the book-to-bill is above 1 but it's not 1.1. It's kind of in the middle.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And the commercial OEM is probably about flat if you take...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And those are full-year 2017 numbers?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. That's book-to-bill. And I wouldn't \u2013 you might get slightly different numbers in the fourth quarter, but I wouldn't draw much from a quarter worth of bookings. They bounce all around.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. I know, I agree. But it's sometimes helpful to know how you're exiting the year compared to the year, but that's helpful for the year. And then just last one for me just to make sure I've button it up for myself on this SCHROTH situation. Am I hearing you correctly that you're not currently actively looking at divesting anything else? You wouldn't expect to be divesting anything else anytime soon? Is that correct?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we surely, as of right now, we're not looking to divest anything else. That's not to say we couldn't decide some business we didn't like, at some point in the future we could divest.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Right, for a different reason.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Nothing to do with SCHROTH that would make us divest anything else. It would purely be our decision to do it of which presently we don't have any in the queue to do that.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But there is nothing...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...there is no bleed across or additional DoJ activity or anything like that that we know of. Of course, you never know what you don't know.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Right. Just wanted to make sure of that. Okay, thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. No, no, I think we've given you the whole story there.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Nick, maybe just last one on SCHROTH, would you be willing to give us what the sort of revenue run rate was tracking for at SCHROTH? Just trying to kind of calibrate...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we gave you what came out of it. I think we gave you what came out of it...","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...right. Then you can figure how many months we had it.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Fair, fair. Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not sure it's exactly linear, but you'll get in the ballpark.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Just on the interiors market, I mean I think last quarter you guys \u2013 it was still down mid-teens. If it finished down around that range you weren't really seeing bottom. And it sounds like we've hit bottom here. I mean you talked about some new opportunities. Do you think any of the weakness \u2013 certainly there were some wide-body challenges, was any of the weakness this year may be tied to just the two big interior guys kind of being acquired or just anything else you can elaborate. I mean it seems like you're going to have some fairly easy comps. We're certainly seeing I think a pickup in some of the retrofit activity that's out there. But any other color you could add?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","A lot of the work we had seen was around rebranding campaigns that had gone on over the last couple of years. And it would appear that we had gone through a lull in that activity. Certainly some of the interior guys were a lot more than others, but I don't really trace it back to specific slowness with them being acquired. I think we all go through peaks and valleys in this largely discretionary market. It is a step-up to go from down to flat to up a small amount, but that's what our teams are forecasting to us.","The question was asked earlier, did we change anything in our process as we collected the 2018 numbers, and we followed the same process. We trust our teams. It is true that they didn't see a lot of the interior slowness coming. But they do see indications as we've guided on a flat-to-low uptick in the interiors business. So that's the color that I can give you. We have scrubbed and looked at were there any changes in market share, did someone cleanup at our expense, and there is no real indication that anything like that happened. It's just the particular customers that we worked with, that we generally work with, didn't have as many of these general marketing campaign changes to their fleets.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the overall aftermarket view, we're seeing a lot of your peers talk about elevated levels of provisioning for some of the new narrow-bodies, even the A350. Do you guys have that level of granularity to see provisioning be a little bit of a tailwind as we move into next year?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. We're not figuring on any provisioning.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","If you see some, that'll be a tailwind.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, okay. Fair. And then just the last one for me here. EBITDA margin I guess for the year pushing up close to 50%. I mean that would be an all-time high. I mean you obviously aren't going to have any acquisition-related dilution there. It would seem like the value creation story is not changing at all for any of the acquired companies. I mean, what are you sort of thinking long-term for that EBITDA margin? Is there a little bit more runway there?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think the reason it's pushing up 50%, it's been there very close to that before is because we didn't buy much in 2017. And it'll grind up there, it'll pick-up, or I don't know, if the mix stays the same, there is no mix shift or something like that, you'll pickup a point or so a year. It's unusual that we don't buy something and it sort of averages it down.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right, right.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I still think there is plenty of juice in our value drivers as we go forward. We're not approaching the end of that by any stretch.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. All right. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. Just to ask that margin question in a slightly different way. Are there any of the businesses that you've bought over the course of 2016 and 2017 that are \u2013 where you're still driving towards the target margin or would you say that the whole company is about at the target margin now and we're just at the place where you go sort of at that 1 point a year pace?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, 2017 there isn't enough to move the needle at all. So we bought a couple of \u2013 three relatively small product lines. They're all go along fine, but they're going to be irrelevant to the overall margin. The 2016 businesses are all marching along nicely against their acquisition plan. But I don't quite know how to answer the question. I would say if you take those businesses out, which is primarily Breeze and DDC, they're still marching along very nicely against their plan. And we see no reason to think they won't get to where we planned them. I think DDC, as we said when we bought it as a company that's margins look like TransDigm margins as it stabilizes out, Breeze may not get quite that far up, and all the rest of the businesses, if you run the businesses with the value drivers and the way we do in total, they move about a 1 point a year.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Great. And then just to follow-up question on an old theme, Boeing obviously increasingly less shy about intentions in the aftermarket, and I think, a lot of us have heard probably about efforts that they have been making to seed more IP in the supply base, are you coming up against that at all. And if so sort of how are you dealing with it?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We have not come across any. We've not had any attempts to take our IP or anything like that. We would be extremely resistant to that. In the aftermarket, we so far \u2013 we haven't seen much. We read the same things you read. We haven't seen a lot. Now, we \u2013 for Boeing's aftermarket, we're a fairly significant customer to them for their Aviall distribution business. So, we \u2013 they get some contribution that way from us.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. But just in your conversations with them, when your sales engineers are looking to sell new products...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, I mean, supplier. At least, we hire them to provide us with distribution service, right.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Maybe that's the best way to put it.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I got it backwards.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And then are your sales engineers sort of seeing a greater effort on their part when you're trying to sell new products to them to insert more of their IP?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not that we've seen.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not that we've seen, no.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","How did he do on that last name, Sheila?","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Well, I'm used to it by now. So, another question on EBITDA growth for you guys. I think, the 7% at your midpoint that you're guiding to growth is sort \u2013 is in line with what you've done historically because this is a core clean year. Just wanted to ask about the productivity, you obviously have a very high EBITDA margin. What sort of opportunities are you finding for additional take out of the existing business?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","For productivity, yeah, we still \u2013 and I commented, I think, briefly that for going forward we will see some opportunities around some limited plant consolidations. We don't love to do a lot of those things, but as we \u2013 some of the product line acquisitions that we did in 2017 moving those into the various facilities. There'll be a number of those opportunities, as well as some rationalization of our manufacturing footprint. We're always looking for those opportunities for routine maintenance, and they do provide nice improvements in productivity. So, yeah, there are a number of those along with our capital spending to drive productivity projects around the ranch. I would say that the productivity deck is as vibrant as ever for opportunities and we continue to find those even in businesses that have been in the fold for a long time.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for that color, Kevin. And then just one more, another supplier last night noted some changes in just the market dynamics. They said they're seeing an increase in RFPs for content on existing platforms. I just wanted to know if you're seeing any of that, is that an opportunity for TransDigm?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Say that again, I'm not sure I followed the question?","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","They noted that they're seeing a pickup in content because of higher RFP opportunities on existing commercial platforms. So, some takeaways as Boeing and Airbus decided to outsource \u2013 in-source. So, I was just wondering if you're seeing any of that, is that a benefit for you, kind of, the...","Kevin M.

Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey. Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, Nick. You highlighted in your sort of review of the year that you made some share buybacks in the year due to volatility in the stock price. How do you feel that buybacks going forward. Is it suddenly that you're feeling more comfortable pulling than maybe you would have done in the past?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think, we just look at buybacks. We look at them just like an acquisition opportunity. I mean, if it's -- if it's somewhat close call against an acquisition, we'd probably make the acquisition. But when they become a shreakingly good buy what they did earlier this year, I think, we bought $400 million-ish, sorry,$400 million-ish.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Rob, if we were in the blackout period and we were stuck with our 10b5filing,we'd probably have bought twice that much, if we could have.

Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We don't have any rule like hold the shares even or something like that.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. And referring back to the drama earlier in the year and \u2013 yeah, all that fun. The commentary about the defense customer, has there been any feedback from the DOD about these issues that were raised?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, as you know, we started down a \u2013 or not we \u2013 the IG audit. There is an IG audit of the buying agencies, which is pretty common in the industry. If you \u2013 it's on the website, almost everybody in the industry gets one of these every few years. That's just moving down the track. They take a long time to complete, and it's just sort of slowly moving along.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then just a final one. On the DOJ acquisition front, have you ever seen this happen before? Is it the first time this has impacted TransDigm?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, we have a \u2013 well, I guess, it's the first time we have read something that needed to be in a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing and back into question. We had one stop on a buy from Goodrich about three years or four years ago.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But it wasn't...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. But we don't \u2013 it was stopped by the DOJ, but that we don't \u2013 frankly we don't quite know why, but it was. This was probably five years ago.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter K. Keay, CFA - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thanks for getting me on the call. How \u2013 Nick, how do you define a shriekingly good buy? And what metric do you use to evaluate, to value your stock and how much...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","He knows it when he sees it.","Hunter K. Keay, CFA - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. I mean, is there a metric you actually use, that's like \u2013 that's triggered to I mean...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we have our own view of when we should be buying. You see something like, you see the kind of things we saw early in the year. And we bought a bunch of stock at $220 or $225. I mean, it was \u2013 we looked at that and said, unless we're miles off, this is a 25%, 30% IRR here.","Hunter K. Keay, CFA - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Obviously, we're heavy buyers in there, I mean, that's the way we look at it.","Hunter K. Keay, CFA - Wolfe Research LLC","With IRR, okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, when it gets closer to \u2013 we look at \u2013 we're looking for returns on our acquisitions up over 20% on the equity we put in them. When it's getting up there, it's looking pretty good to us. When it's more in the mid-teens return, that's good, but it's not shrieking alternative to making buys, acquisitions.","Hunter K. Keay, CFA - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Whereas I'll say again, at $225 we thought we're not going to see any acquisition that returns to us the way this does.","Hunter K. Keay, CFA - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. So you know it when you see it basically. Okay. That's helpful.","And then you brought up CSeries in the prepared remarks, significant content. Can you talk about how much content you have on that program or maybe with Bombardier in general? And do you have long-term pricing agreements in place with them to protect yourself in the event that they make a sort of renewed push down the supply chain for some cost savings?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We do have long-term agreements in place. It's different business by business, but I would say we do have long-term agreements in place.","Our content is significantly higher. We don't want to get into the differences in one program to another, but versus current narrow bodies, it's a significant difference. It's a great program for all of TransDigm and many of our groups participate.","Hunter K. Keay, CFA - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. This is Bill on for Gautam. Wanted to follow-up on a couple of the questions around Boeing. I think, a couple calls ago you said PF \u2013 your renegotiation of PFS is starting this year. So just wondering where you are with that? And if there's anything we should be watchful for throughout the year?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I mean, it's moving slowly, slowly forward, sort of in fits and starts. I can't say that there's any particular acceleration. I mean the contract runs out at the end of, I want to say calendar year 2018.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Is that right, Kevin?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Calendar year 2018. Usually these go right up to the end.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And are you seeing any different behavior out of Boeing in these rounds? Or is it still too early to tell?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're seeing no difference in behavior this round versus the original one from several years ago. We're working through the details. The teams are meeting on a regular basis, but it's difficult to predict when this will be all put to bed.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a question going back to the M&A deals in 2016. Have you seen any pushback on post M&A price hikes? Or is your ability to generate value with these acquisitions been sort of in line with what you thought?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We haven't seen any material change in the dynamics in the industry. We've been \u2013 we're right in line or in total, I'm not going to comment price versus cost versus \u2013 but I would say the price dynamics are right, are fine. No change. And in total, the acquisitions are \u2013 at least the two most recent ones in substance are running nicely ahead of our expectations.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just one last one on SCHROTH. You mentioned you had a buyer lined up. Is this a strategic buyer or a financial buyer?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I don't want to identify the buyer until we're closing it.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Lipke from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Drew Lipke - Stephens Inc.","Hey. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just piggybacking on a question from earlier. If we look at the interiors business and think about the consolidation there that was mentioned and thinking about the sales channel there and Airbus standing up their dedicated interior services division, has that been at all impactful for the trends that we've seen just in terms of the channel with interiors?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not seeing any real changes there. I could be wrong, but the guidance I have from the teams are that there really isn't any change. It's just the timing. And it's not OEM dependent. It's how the teams want to refurbish on what is a very much so a discretionary decision.","Drew Lipke - Stephens Inc.","Okay. And then if we think about business jet and you mentioned in the past that it's hard to determine what's OEM and what's aftermarket, just given the channel that it flows through. And we have seen business jet utilization up 3% in the U.S. and 8% in Europe over the last 12 months. And a lot of the OEMs are posting pretty strong aftermarket growth.","And so I'm curious has that \u2013 have you seen a change in the sales channel within bizjet, given more flowing through the OEM? And that's maybe part of what's impacting your bizjet aftermarket?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think so. The aftermarket for business jet always flows through the OEM. So we have varying degrees of visibility as to what's happening. I would love to see it up more, but we forecast a flat market there for business jet and helicopter into 2018. I think, I alluded to maybe business jet would be a little bit better, but it would be offset by not a great helicopter market, I believe. So, that is what we see. I would love to be wrong about that. We've discussed that amongst ourselves that eventually you hit the bottom and you start to come out of it, but so far we're not seeing a lot of that.","Drew Lipke - Stephens Inc.","Okay. So fair to say, you don't think the channel has been impactful like as we think about, and you mentioned Aviall, lot of your sales with Boeing go through Aviall, and I think, you had some instances where they've required a pound of flesh in terms of distributing more with like Whippany through Aviall, that hasn't been impactful on business jet or interiors?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, not at all. We don't distribute that way in those markets anyway, so we don't go through Aviall for or Satair, you know, the big distributors for business jet, that largely goes through the OEMs.","Drew Lipke - Stephens Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And interiors largely go direct.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Go direct.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Direct to the airline.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Drew Lipke - Stephens Inc.","Okay. All right, thanks. And just last one, I know, your ability to comment here is more limited, but just regarding the Inspector General Audit, your comments previously alluded to the audit being focused only on contracting procedures for certain TransDigm awards. And if you look at the DOD memorandum, it states a much broader objective. I'm curious could you reconcile that for us just in terms of the potential scope of the audit?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know what I'm reconciling. It's hard for me to answer that. These -- we've had these before and it seems to be following the same path and the same kind of path, I see when I read the other ones on the IG website.","Drew Lipke - Stephens Inc.","Okay.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Liza Sabol from Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. I would like to thank you all that have called in today and welcome you to TransDigm's fiscal 2015 first quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley, Chief Operating Officers, Bob Henderson and Kevin Stein and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. Replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that the statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC. These filings are available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley","Good morning and thanks again to everyone for calling. As usual, today, I will first review our consistent business strategy then I will go through our financial performance and some market summary for Q1 2015 and then just a few comments on our guidance for the full year.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize a few of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary engineered products and around three-quarters of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the downturns. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has, year in, year out, generated very strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structure flexibility.","We follow a very consistent long-term strategy. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy focused around our three value driver concept. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system with executives and senior management who think, act and are paid like owners. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as another means to create shareholder value.","To reiterate, we basically have four alternatives for capital allocations. Our priorities are typically as follows. First, invest in our existing businesses, second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy, these two are almost always our first choices, third, give the extra back to shareholders either through a special dividend or stock buyback and fourth, pay off debt, though given the low cost of the debt, especially after tax, this is likely our last choice, particularly in current capital market conditions.","With respect to financial capacity, we have a little over $1 billion of cash, roughly $ 400 million in unrestricted undrawn revolver and additional capacity under our credit agreement. We ended the quarter with a net leverage of 5.9 times EIBTDA, well below our credit agreement limit. At 12\/27\/14, or the end of the quarter, based on current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $2 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for 2015. We did not purchase any additional shares in Q1.","Now turning to our Q1 2015 performance. Remind you, this is the first quarter of our fiscal year 2015. Our year started October 1. Q1 was relatively quiet. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in the OEM aftermarket mix, large orders, transient inventory fluctuations, modest seasonality and other factors. But in any event, total GAAP revenues were up about 11% versus the prior Q1. Organic revenues were up about 3% on a first quarter versus prior year first quarter basis. Fiscal year 2015 Q1 revenues were right in line with our expectations of roughly similar percent relationship as 2014, that is about 23% of actual full year revenues. I would remind everyone, there are less shipping days in Q1 than any other quarter.","Now, reviewing the revenues by market category on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q1. By pro forma, I mean, if we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial markets, which make up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 6% versus the prior Q1. This is primarily driven by commercial transport OEM revenues, though a modest part of our business, our BizJet OEM revenues were up about 11% year-over-year, a bit higher than we have seen. I think this is just mostly timing.","After a red-hot last six months of fiscal year 2014, total commercial aftermarket revenue growth slowed down some in Q1 of 2015. On a Q1 versus prior year Q1 basis, revenues were up 5% after year-over-year increases of around 16% in the second half of 2014. The revenue growth in Q1 versus the prior year was reduced about 1.5% to 2% by some distribution inventory movements. We could see a little more of this. Bookings for the quarter were modestly ahead of shipments in the commercial aftermarket.","The defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenues. Defense revenues were up 2% versus the prior year first quarter. The revenues were spotty by operating unit with no clear trends. First quarter defense bookings were up 23% versus the prior year Q1 and ran well ahead of revenues. The primary contributors were two large airborne specialty parachute orders. As always, we remain somewhat cautious about trends in the military market. All-in-all, we had no substantive variation from our revenue expectations for Q1.","Now moving on to profitability and on a reported basis, again I am going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q1 were quite modest, made up of non-cash compensation expense and some acquisition costs. Our EBITDA As Defined of about $270 million for Q1 was up 11% versus the prior Q1. EBITDA As Defined margins were about 46%. The Q1 margins, without dilution from the impact of two acquisitions purchased in 2014, that is Airborne and EME Holding, was approximately 48% or up 2% versus Q1 of 2014 for the same mix of business.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue actively looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is active with a fairly broad range of deal sizes. The closings have been slow. We have seen reasonable amount of activity recently but closings are always difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Now moving on to the 2015 guidance. Based on our current view of the markets we are not changing our full year guidance. We believe there could be some organic upside in the EBITDA. But we prefer to see a little more market strength before we make an adjustment. As usual, our guidance does not include any new acquisitions. To confirm the original market growth assumptions for year-over-year growth, commercial aftermarket, high single-digit percents, commercial OEM, mid single digits, defense about flat. In total, with some puts and takes, our markets look about as we anticipated three months ago. As usual, we will look at this again next quarter and update it if we see any changes.","And with that, I will hand it over to Greg.","Greg Rufus","Okay. Thanks, Nick. Good morning. As we have said in the past and just to remind you again, all of my comments are on a GAAP reported basis, where Nick's comments were mostly on a pro forma basis. Sometimes, we do have minor differences in our explanations.","As disclosed in this morning's press release, our first quarter sales were $587 million and 11% greater than the prior year. Our organic sales were 3% higher than last year, driven by growth in commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM offset with a modest decline in GAAP defense sales. Our first quarter gross profit was $321 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year. The reported gross profit margin of 54.7% was one margin point higher than the prior year. A decrease in non-operating acquisition related cost versus the prior year contributed to the higher reported gross margin.","Margins in the current quarter were also negatively impacted by approximately two margin points due to acquisition mix from Airborne and EME. In other words, excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margin in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved approximately two margin points. The base businesses continued to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure.","Selling and administrative expenses were 11.5% of sales for the current quarter compared to 10.8% in the prior year. The current quarter was running a little higher than the prior period, primarily due to higher run rate as a percent of sales from our recent acquisitions. Interest expense was $99 million, an increase of approximately $18 million or 23% versus the prior-year quarter. This is a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $7.5 billion in the current quarter versus $5.7 million in the prior year.","The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the amount borrowed to fund the $25 per share special dividend paid in Q3 of last year. Also, in conjunction with the dividend, we refinanced $1.6 billion of existing notes at a lower interest rate. This refinancing helped lower our weighted average cash interest rate to 5.1% compared to 5.4% to the prior year.","Our effective tax rate was 32.6% in the current quarter compared to 33.6% in the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter was primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. We still expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be around 33% and our cash taxes to be approximately $180 million.","Our net income for the quarter increased $9.4 million or 11% to $95.5 million, which is 16% of sales. This compares to net income of $86.1 million in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, the decrease in acquisition related costs and amortization expense and a lower effective tax rate. These items were offset with the higher interest expense just discussed.","GAAP earnings per share was $1.63 per share in the current quarter compared to a $1.44 per share last year. The current earnings per share growth of 13% is higher than net income growth due to lower weighted average shares outstanding resulting from repurchasing over 900,000 shares last year and slightly lower dividend equivalent payments made in the current year versus last year. Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.80 per share, an increase of 8% compared to $1.66 per share last year. Again, please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP to adjusted EPS.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company's net debt leverage ratio was 5.9 times our pro forma EBITDA As Defined in gross leverage was 6.8 times pro forma EBITDA. We still expect to generate $475 million of cash in the current year and expect our September 30, 2015 year-end net leverage to be in the 5.2 times EBITDA As Defined or de-levering approximately one full turn on a net basis.","Before I hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A session, I would like to inform you that we will be filing our Q this upcoming Friday.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. Operator, we are now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from the Royal Bank of Canada. Go ahead, Robert.","Robert Stallard","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Greg Rufus","Good morning.","Nick Howley","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard","Nick, I was wondering if we could kickoff with your thoughts on the debt market here, whether you are seeing any opportunities to raise debt at more attractive rates than what you have seen in recent history? And then also your follow-on from that, your thoughts on deploying that as a special dividend?","Nick Howley","Yes. The debt market first. As I think you know, the recent history, the last round of financing we raised what was that? Nine months ago or something?","Greg Rufus","It was back in June.","Nick Howley","Yes. I mean that was pretty darned attractive rates. I think those, particularly the bonds, are selling actually at just a hair under par, which would tell me that the rates are very, very, very close to what they are now. That market got a little bumpy but I think it's reasonably stable now. So I think if we went out today, we could raise money today. I don't know what tomorrow would be, but I think if we went out today we could probably raise money at very comparable rates to what we did six or nine months ago. Let me just presume that we had roughly the same leverage levels.","As far as capital deployment, I think we will address that as the year proceeds. We have a fair amount of acquisition, I would say, activity we are working on and we probably will let them play out a little bit before we make a decision on capital allocation.","Robert Stallard","Great and then as a follow up, you mentioned about some issues in the distribution channel in the aerospace aftermarket. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you think might be going on there?","Nick Howley","I think they probably got a little held in terms of the ordering at the end of last year. You know that we ran 15% and 18%. We also moved a few distributors around which might have influenced it a little bit. I don't take a whole lot from that. But I just thought it was worthwhile data point to let people know.","Robert Stallard","Okay. That's great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Co. Go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Yes. Thank you. Good morning.","Greg Rufus","Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","I just wanted to ask if you could elaborate on the defense bookings comment. You mentioned the two parachute orders and what was the trend if you X that out? Was it a book-to-bill of around one? Or any comment there?","Nick Howley","I don't remember the book. There's a couple of things. If you want to normalize it, if you go into the previous first quarter, we had some of those big Tarian shipments, if you remember them. So you almost have to normalize them both out and I don't think if you normalize both of those, I don't think the organic growth is that much different, whether you put it in or take it out on sales, on revenues. On the bookings, the big difference is if you may or may not recall, the first quarter of last year, things looked pretty ugly in the parachute business. But that has really started the book up. We have got some quite big orders dropped in. We have some more just cooking away. So that business is whereas we were a bit concerned six months into it, we are starting to feel significantly better now about it. I hope that answers [ph] your question.","Gautam Khanna","Okay.","Nick Howley","So I think when you normalize the revenues, the answer doesn't change a whole lot. If you normalize it for things in both quarters.","Gautam Khanna","Okay and could you give us -- you mentioned this pipeline of opportunities being active in the M&A pipeline? Can you give us some sense for what kind of things you were seeing international versus domestic whether you are seeing more in defense or commercial and relative sizes? Any way to kind of?","Nick Howley","I would say, the sizes are roughly comparable to what we have seen before, though I have to say we have seen a few of little more sizable. I don't mean in the $3 billion, $4 billion range, but a little more sizable. If you pull those couple out, the rest are more in the normal kind of things we see. We clearly continue to see more European activity than we have in the past. And I would say most of what we are looking at, not all but most, is commercial rather military.","Gautam Khanna","Okay and are most of these privates? Or are they --","Nick Howley","Range, the usual range of suspects. Private, strategic and PE","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Thanks a lot. I will get back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is actually Joe, on for Rob. Thanks for taking the question. Nick, I wanted to ask on BizJet OE and recognizing it is a small part of commercial OE but what's driving that big uptick in BizJet OE? Are there any particular platforms where you are seeing that strength?","Nick Howley","First of all, it is pretty broadly distributed across the platforms. I wouldn't draw much from that, other than it is just timing. You know, as everybody knows, the bigger, more expensive ones are doing a little better than the lower priced ones and we are reasonably represented in that. But I don't mean to imply anything as far as the production rate forecast for business jet OEM. I think it is just timing, just when the shipments happen to fall.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. I will jump back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Greg Rufus","Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","I wondered if you could maybe help us out with how aftermarket averages something greater than 10% the rest of the year to get to your full-year guidance, just because the quarter at 5% and it seemed like end market conditions were reasonably strong in the quarter. I know you pointed out the distributor item but even if I adjust for that.","Nick Howley","Yes. That's not a lot.","Noah Poponak","Not a lot. So help us out with what changes in that growth rate through the rest of the year?","Nick Howley","I believe, Noah, that's a leading question. I believe to make it through the year, we will have to see pickup in the back-half of the year, to state the obvious.","Noah Poponak","So what changes in the actual end market? Because the comps get more difficult. It doesn't seem like traffic would accelerate. IT seems like you would almost have to be counting on airline inventory restocking or some deferred maintenance opening up or something else idiosyncratic to the company.","Nick Howley","I would say, as I said, if you look at the balance of the year, if I had a handy cap or guidance, I am going to take our guidance on EBITDA, which all of you know is the bps guidance too, I would say there's probably some uncertainty around the commercial aftermarket. Clearly, it has to pickup in the second half of the year.","We were sort of halfway through the year last year with the same concern and then in the last six months we got pretty strong. I am not prepared at this point to say that the numbers we have been using are not good. I think there is some reasonable chance. But it clearly is a little bit of a stretch each quarter that goes by.","On the other hand I think the defense, we probably could be conservative and I think we could be a little conservative on the margins. So sort of like the putting them all in the stew, it looks to me like there's probably a little more up and down at this point in the guidance. But I can't tell you I am absolutely sure about one segment versus the other, but hopefully you have got the sense.","Noah Poponak","Okay and then maybe following on that, Nick, I wondered if you might provide your view on what you think lower oil means for the industry? It would seem like that could potentially help the aftermarket, but it sounds like others are saying, at least, that it's not quite yet? And it seems like it could potentially stretch out the replacement decision for an airline. Anything you are already hearing and seeing or anything you think could happen as a result?","Nick Howley","I think, Noah, probably the same things you hear and see and surmise. First I would say, I think the oil prices have to stay down for a longer period of time to change anyone's behavior substantively. They have got to work out through the hedges or buy them out or something. And I don't think this is enough time to change people's thought patterns or behavior patterns.","Now if it does, there are two schools of thought. As you know, on the one hand, if you fly all planes all the planes longer, that's better for the aftermarket. If you pull them out of the desert or if you keep flying them more hours, which you would tend to do, if you have lower prices, that's good. On the other hand, I will say, historically if fuel prices go down, then the airlines get profitable. Right or wrong, historically, when they make money, they start buying new airplanes.","So that's sort of the counterbalance. At this point, I don't know how to call that, other than to say, it's something we have got to watch closely. But I suspect it takes a longer period of time for anyone to change their thought pattern.","Noah Poponak","So you haven't actually yet seen any real behavioral change?","Nick Howley","No. We have not.","Noah Poponak","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, sir.","Lou Taylor","Yes. Hi. This is actually Lou, on for Myles. How are you guys doing?","Greg Rufus","Okay.","Nick Howley","Good.","Lou Taylor","Just a quick question. The cash flow was very strong in the quarter. Anything in particular to drive that? It's not usually the strongest quarter.","Greg Rufus","You are right. In the first quarter, first our quarter effectively ended December 25 and we didn't have any principal and paid almost no income taxes. So it was timing. That's why in my comments, I said we still expect to get the same amount by the end of the year because we have little bit of outflow for those payments in the second quarter.","Lou Taylor","I know it looked like working capital was a boost as well?","Greg Rufus","Well, I don't know what you mean when you say a boost. Can you expand on that?","Lou Taylor","It was $65 million. Prior years it was more of a use of cash.","Greg Rufus","Okay. Well, when I look at the working capital, when I look at operating, I look more at my DSOs and my inventory turns and they were well behaved versus our expectations. Sometimes when you look at the GAAP numbers it can get distorted with some acquisition accounting.","Nick Howley","The big numbers, Greg, are the timing.","Greg Rufus","The timing.","Nick Howley","So you didn't have an interest payment there.","Greg Rufus","That's right. There was a cutoff of it.","Lou Taylor","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Go ahead, Ken.","Ken Herbert","Hi. Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Ken Herbert","I wanted to first ask about Airborne and EME. It's been over a year for Airborne and almost a year for EME. Are these following sort of a trajectory in terms of margin improvement as you expected? Or is it maybe a little slower than expected, considering still sort of a two point of gross margin impact we saw from acquisition? Did I get it? It's all the related expenses, but how are these tracking relative to your expectations?","Nick Howley","Let me deal with them in two pieces. Airborne first. As you probably know, for the first year of ownership, Airborne was, frankly the revenues and bookings were lower than we expected and concurrently the EBITDA was little lower. However in 2015, it's starting off well. Our present expectation is that for this year, it will be at or above our expectations at the time we bought it. I remind you that both Airborne and EME, as we said when we bought them, we sort of had to buy these right. These are not businesses that are going to get the typical TransDigm margins. They will move up. And they are moving up, but they won't get to those kind of margins. We bought them at substantially below the margins we typically buy things. But we saw plenty value there.","EME is again moving up. We bought that at a sub-20 or significantly kind of EBITDA margin. That is moving up reasonably nicely. Again it will never get up to full year 50%, but it's moving up significantly. It's a small business. So it's never going to move the average much. Dollar wise, it's also going to be impacted by the exchange rate situation. It's a Euro business. So the actually dollars have been knocked down on the conversion, though the margin is moving up reasonably well.","Ken Herbert","Okay. That's helpful.","Nick Howley","That was never going to move anything. That's never going to move anything.","Ken Herbert","Yes. It's a smaller deal. I guess, with EME in particular, being obviously based in Europe and in Germany, in particular, currency risk aside, because who knows about that, but has your experience with that acquisition changed your appetite at all for European transactions? Maybe you opened it up a little bit? Or is there anything we could infer from just your experience now almost a year in with EME that might alter your thinking as you review European --","Nick Howley","We feel okay about that. I think we feel okay about it. We see acquisitions with the right value proposition. We feel fine about them. I would remind you, we have a business in Belgium. We have a business in Germany now. We have a couple of businesses in U.K. that were operating. So we have, I would say in general, not 100%, but mostly our experiences has been positive.","Ken Herbert","Okay. That's good. And then just finally, just to follow up on the commercial aftermarket discussion. To your comment, Nick, that in an environment like this when the airlines have better visibility on profit, you are maybe not seeing utilization change in terms of the older aircraft or pulling them out of the desert or anything. But does their willingness to spend on new aircraft translate to the aftermarket environment either in terms of, maybe they might take a different approach, the airlines, different approach to their own working capital, their own inventory levels, their safety stocks, et cetera? Do you expect, perhaps, to see that as we go through the year, assuming ongoing lower crude prices?","Nick Howley","Typically, we have. Typically that's what happens, as you know. When they start to be profitable and they get money, they start buying more. Start buying more everything, airplanes, parts, everything. I can't say we have seen it yet, but that would be a not atypical pattern. As I said before, I don't think this situation of these low significant drop in fuel prices has been in there long enough that it's changing people's behavior yet.","Ken Herbert","Okay. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli from KeyBanc. Go ahead, sir.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick, maybe just back on defense. It clearly sounds like you have got some, the orders you were waiting for on the Airborne side and I am just curious, were you guys expecting those orders to come in when you laid out your initial guidance? I know you talked, maybe there was potential upside to defense this year, but I am trying to get a sense of whether or not the Airborne order flow was baked into this year's outlook.","Nick Howley","We definitely had an increase in this year's outlook for Airborne. We expected a pickup.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay.","Nick Howley","And at least first, one quarter end, it's looking quite strong and the pipeline looks strong.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay.","Nick Howley","I don't want to start to pull out our full year's guidance between operating units, but it surely makes us feel better rather than worse.","Michael Ciarmoli","Sure and then what about just broad commentary about your remaining traditional military aftermarket activity? Are you seeing any movement there? I know there are some other companies expecting aftermarket to begin picking up here. Are you seeing any changes in purchasing pattern from the DoD or any discernible trends?","Nick Howley","I honestly can't say we have. I also am getting a little resistant to predict this. The only thing I can say with certainty is every time I tried it, it was wrong. By the way, we are on a little on the upside, thank God, but I can't say. It's mixed. If you look across our operating units, it's mixed.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay.","Nick Howley","I don't know that I can give you a clear pattern or region for that. Other than in the parachute business, we know we had some big international orders [indiscernible].","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay. That's fair and last one. I don't know if you have color on this, but now that the A350 has been delivered, any kind of change in the view there on initial provisioning? I know there probably aren't too many airlines getting that platform this year, but any color on that? Could that be additive to this year or is that more going to be a --","Nick Howley","Yes, Michael, we are not figuring on any. Could it be? Yes, yes, maybe.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay.","Nick Howley","But we are not figuring it in our guidance or numbers. We are not figuring.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay. Perfect. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Go ahead, Joe.","Joe Nadol","Hi. Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning, Joe.","Greg Rufus","Good morning.","Joe Nadol","I had a question. You mentioned that you didn't buy back any stock in the quarter and the last few quarters you have been buying back some stock. What caused you to hold back in the quarter?","Nick Howley","What caused it? I don't know anything particular. We sort of bought up what we planned to buy up and we reauthorize more, but we just decided not to do it. I don't know that there's -- I wouldn't take too much out of that. But we bought quite about 900,000 or so shares.","Greg Rufus","More unusual if we bought.","Nick Howley","Yes. It was more unusual if we bought them. We didn't buy. So we sort of bought up about what we had in mind to buy and we stopped.","Operator","Joe's line has disconnected.","Nick Howley","Is that the end? We cut everybody off?","Liza Sabol","Operator?","Operator","No, it's only Joe's line.","Nick Howley","Okay. So we lost him.","Operator","Liza Sabol","Okay. If there are no further questions, we thank you all for calling in today and look for our 10-Q to be filed on Friday, as Greg mentioned. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today, Ms. Liza Sabol, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings conference call. With me on the line this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Skulina.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. Replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com. Please note that we should file our Form 10-Q no later than Monday, May 7, and also will be found on our website.","Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that the statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC, which will be available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","We would also like to advise you that, during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks everyone for calling in. Today, I'll start off with a brief overview of our recent organizational announcement and comments on our consistent strategy, a quick summary of second quarter fiscal year 2018, and a quick overview of the new acquisitions. Kevin will then review the company performance for the quarter and the year, and Jim will run through the financials.","As you may have seen, we recently announced an organization change. Kevin Stein has been elected by the Board of Directors to be our new CEO with responsibilities for all operational and financial matters. All our operating execs as well as the CFO will report to Kevin. I have become Executive Chairman and I will continue my duties with respect to overall corporate strategy, capital allocation, M&A, investor interaction, board management and similar matters. As part of this transition, I extended my employment contract by five years or through 2024. Kevin's contract was also amended and now runs through 2024.","We have been working on this transition for almost four years now. Kevin has done an excellent job learning our culture and processes. He has also contributed substantially to the significant value created over that time. He clearly understands and embraces our long-term value generating strategy. He is a good choice and I'm confident he will do a fine job.","Now to reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry both in its consistency and its ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize why we believe this? About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and over three quarters of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues historically produce higher gross margins and have provided relative stability in downturns.","Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. One, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Two, we have a simple, well proven value-based operating methodology based on our three value drivers. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns our management with the shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit our focused strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And fifth, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. We basically have four. Our priorities typically are as follows; One, to invest in our existing business. Second, to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy and return requirements. These are almost always our first choices. Our third is to give money back to the shareholders either through special dividend or stock buybacks. And our last is to pay off debt, but given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in current capital market conditions.","In the last three years, we've seen significantly different business conditions and have allocated our capital accordingly. In March of fiscal year 2018, we announced two acquisitions for about $575 million that both fit our consistent strategy. We expect these deals to generate solid PE-like equity returns. We'll see how the rest of the year proceeds and as always, allocate our capital in a way we believe best maximizes the return to the shareholders. We continue to be reasonably active in the M&A world with a decent pipeline but, as usual, I can't predict or comment on any potential closings.","To quickly review the two recent acquisitions, Kirkhill and Extant, are both primarily, proprietary sole source aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket. Kirkhill's annual revenues are about $90 million and almost all of this comes from aerospace. The transaction closed on March 15. The business is about evenly split between commercial and military revenues. The company's elastomer products are used on a broad range of commercial and military platforms, including most major new platforms. The profitability of this business has been problematic. We see a clear path to substantially improve the profitability, but it may take a little longer than usual.","Extant is an attractive and unique business model. The company acquires and\/or exclusively licenses mature products at or near the end of their new platform production cycles and provides the products and related aftermarket services for the remaining useful life. This can often be 30 years or more, particularly for the military products. Extant's revenues are about $85 million. Again, this business is primarily aerospace, with a very high, that is, 80-plus-percent of the revenue in the aftermarket. The business is a mix of defense and commercial, but is more heavily weighted towards defense. This transaction closed on April 24.","We will also launch a new debt offering this afternoon. The market continues to look strong and accommodating. Our current intention is to raise about $1.2 billion of new money. This is to replace the money we recently spent and also add a little more dry powder. As usual, if we don't see good accretive acquisition uses in some reasonable timeframe, we may well return some of the money to our shareholders.","Additionally, the call protection on about $5 billion of our floating rate debt is due to expire at the end of May. As a result, we will also reprice this debt in order to reduce the spread over LIBOR that we currently pay. This should help to mitigate any future increases in LIBOR rates. We expect that we can lock this in well ahead of the call protection expiration date.","Now to quickly summarize Q2 and year-to-date fiscal year 2018. Kevin is going to address this in more detail. On a Q2 and year-to-date operations, that is revenue and EBITDA As Adjusted were strong, a little ahead of our expectations and up over last year. EBITDA As Adjusted margins on both a quarter and year-to-date basis were up about a point. Our year-to-date Q2 earnings per share, both GAAP and As Adjusted are up significantly, both impacted by the new tax and improved operating performance.","In the commercial aftermarket, revenues were strong, both against prior year Q2 and year-to-date. Freight related aftermarket was up very substantially. Commercial OEM revenues continue mixed, but overall slightly soft. Defense revenues were up modestly. However, incoming orders in both OEM and the aftermarket defense areas were quite strong. We feel good about the first half of 2018, especially with respect to the commercial aftermarket revenues and defense orders.","Excluding acquisitions or capital structure activity, we still expect to generate about $1 billion in cash from operations after considering the impact of the new tax law. As I mentioned, Kirkhill and Extant use up about $575 million of this $1 billion.","Based on the solid first half results and recent acquisitions, we are adjusting our guidance for the year. Our midpoint revenue guidance has increased by $95 million, reflecting both the recent acquisitions and our improved base business performance. Our midpoint EBITDA As Adjusted has increased by $25 million, reflecting the same factors as above. About two-thirds of this increase is due to the new acquisitions. We do not expect Kirkhill to contribute any substantive EBITDA in 2018.","Our midpoint EPS as adjusted has increased by $0.40 a share. This is primarily the result of the improved EBITDA I just mentioned. In summary, the first half of fiscal year 2018 was a good start to the year. So far the balance of the year looks positive. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent, value-focused strategy and strong mix of businesses we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors.","And now let me hand this over to Kevin, who'll discuss more detail of the operation.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter and an encouraging first half of fiscal year 2018. Now, let's review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide colored commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period and 2017, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.","In the commercial market, which makes up close to 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. In our commercial OEM market, Q2 fiscal year 2018 revenues decreased approximately 2% when compared with Q2 of fiscal year 2017.","Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the majority of our commercial OEM business, were down slightly in Q2 when compared to the prior year period. The vast majority of this softness is attributed to weakness in wide-body build rates at both Airbus and Boeing, and the impact these reductions or delays have on the extended supply chain. As was the case in previous quarters, commercial transport OEM sales can fluctuate from time to time, but at its core, our shipset content remains robust, so any softness is simply timing related.","Business jet and helicopter OEM revenues make up about 15% of our commercial OEM revenues. In total, year-to-date revenues in this market are up mid-single-digits compared to the first half of fiscal 2017, driven by stronger growth in the business jet market offset by weaker performance in the helicopter market. Bookings versus shipments year-to-date were up even more. A welcome change from past quarters and similar to what our peer group is seeing in this market segment.","Our total commercial OEM market year-to-date has grown slightly slower than we originally forecast due to our aforementioned wide-body softness. We're now lowering our commercial OEM full year revenue guidance to grow in the low single-digit percentage range from our previous guidance of mid-single-digit growth.","Now, moving on to our commercial aftermarket business. Total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 15% in the quarter. Commercial transport aftermarket, which makes up about 85% of our total commercial aftermarket, revenues in Q2 fiscal year 2018 were up 15% over the prior year period and up 13% year-to-date. This revenue increase was driven by very strong performance in the freight aftermarket, offset by slower growth in the discretionary interiors aftermarket.","In general, continued global revenue passenger mile growth and slower retirements of older aircraft seem to provide a backdrop of improved market dynamics.","Finally, for the business jet\/helicopter aftermarket which accounts for the final 15% of revenue in our total commercial aftermarket, sales were up in the low double-digits in Q2 of fiscal year 2018. Business jet takeoff and landing cycles and used business jet inventories continue their modest improvement from previous quarters, albeit still well off of their peak performance.","The aftermarket in this segment tends to go through the OEM and as such we do not have the same level of insight into this market segment, so cautious optimism remains for this market segment.","Since we're halfway through our fiscal year 2018, I wanted to update you on where the commercial aftermarket submarkets are compared to the original guidance we gave you back in November. The passenger segment, we're slightly better than our original guidance. For the freight segment, we're performing well above. Discretionary interiors are at guidance, but this market remains difficult to predict. And then finally, business jet and helicopters are nicely higher than our original guidance.","In total, our commercial aftermarket is running better than our original expectations of mid-single-digit growth. So we're raising our full year commercial aftermarket guidance for growth mid to high single-digits. Given the weaker comps from the first half of 2017 and the variability observed across the industry and the commercial aftermarket quarter-to-quarter over the last few years, we have elected to take a more cautious tone until we see more in reference to aftermarket growth across TransDigm for the balance of the year.","Now let me speak about our defense market, which is just over 30% of our total revenue. The defense market which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues was up approximately 5% over the prior year Q2. Strong defense aftermarket revenue growth was tempered by slower defense OEM shipments. The vast majority of the defense OEM market softness can be tied to declines in A400M build rates.","Total defense bookings continue to provide an encouraging narrative as bookings are up close to 20% for the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to prior year, with strength in both OEM and aftermarket. Year-to-date, bookings have outpaced sales by an even larger percentage. Year-to-date total defense market segment sales and bookings are well distributed and appear to be coming from most businesses that support defense-related platforms.","Due to the exceptionally strong year-to-date bookings, we're increasing our defense full-year revenue guidance to grow mid-single-digits from our previous guidance of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth.","Now, moving on to profitability and on a reported basis, Jim will provide more on the numbers, but let me touch on operating margin for TransDigm. The EBITDA As Defined margin for continuing operations came in at just under 50% of revenues for Q2 of fiscal year 2018, an improvement year-over-year of just over 1 percentage point for the same period. Margin improvement progress is always important to us and indicates that our base business continues to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers.","Finally, let me touch on our two recent closed acquisitions. Kirkhill, headquartered in Brea, California is a leading supplier of highly engineered aerospace elastomers, used primarily as seals. Kirkhill employs about 800 people with annual revenues of about $90 million.","Extant located in Melbourne, Florida employs more than 170 and expects to generate revenue of approximately $85 million from the fiscal year ending September 2018. Extant provides a broad range of proprietary aftermarket products and repair and overhaul services to the aerospace and defense end markets.","It is too early in our integration process to provide any specific color on these acquisitions. However, we do expect both of these businesses to create equity value well in line with our long-term private equity-type return objectives. Initial thoughts at this point. While Extant's only been in the fold for a few days so not much to say there. However, for Kirkhill, our initial value thesis looks solid, validating our acquisition model.","So let me conclude by stating, all in all Q2 of fiscal year 2018 was another solid quarter for TransDigm, focused on our value drivers of profitable new business, productivity and value pricing, and the successful integration of our recent acquisitions will set us up for a strong second half of 2018.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Skulina.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. Good second quarter. Now, I'll review the second quarter financial results. Second quarter net sales were $933 million, up $64 million or approximately 7% greater than the prior year.","Organic sales made up the majority of the increase and were up 6.6%. This does not include any Kirkhill activity. TransDigm purchased Kirkhill in Q2 and the acquisition closed on March 15th. We've only owned Kirkhill for two weeks and did not include any sales or profit in our Q2 results.","Our first quarter gross profit was $534 million, an increase of 9%. Our reported gross profit margin of 57.2% was about one margin point higher than the prior year, primarily due to the strength of our proprietary products and the favorable product mix.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.5% of sales for the current quarter, compared to 11.6% in the prior year. Interest expense increased by approximately $13 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter. This is a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt of $11.8 billion in the current quarter versus $11.2 billion in the prior year as well as increasing LIBOR rates.","During the quarter, we successfully repriced approximately $1.8 billion of our term loans to take advantage of better rates, by decreasing from LIBOR plus 3.0% to LIBOR plus 2.5%. The expected annualized interest expense savings before fees is approximately $9 million related to this repricing.","We are now assuming an average LIBOR of about 1.8% for the full year with LIBOR rates approaching 2.4% by the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, once rates hit 2%, our credit swaps start to kick in. We still expect our full year interest expense to be approximately $650 million, assuming no change in our current debt structure.","The savings from repricing the $1.8 billion term loans along with our credit swaps offset the increase in LIBOR. However, as Nick mentioned, we are in the process of acquiring additional debt. We did not include any of the new financing activities in our interest guidance.","Now, moving on to taxes. The U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, 2017 that significantly reduced our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018. As a result, the effective GAAP tax rate was 18.3% for the current quarter, compared to 27.7% in the prior quarter.","We are still estimating our full-year GAAP tax rate to be around 6% to 7%, the adjusted tax rate to be around 9% to 10% and the cash tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.","Our net income from continuing operations in the quarter increased $46 million or 30% to $202 million, which is 22% of sales. This compares to net income of $156 million or 18% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the lower effective tax rate and increasing net sales partially offset by higher interest expense versus the prior period.","GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $3.63 per share in the current quarter, compared to $2.79 per share last year. Our adjusted net income from the quarter rose 24.5% to $210.8 million or $3.79 per share from $169.3 million or $3.03 per share in the comparable quarter a year ago.","Adjusted earnings per share in the current fiscal year includes $0.41 of favorable impact from the enactment of tax reform. Excluding this favorable tax impact, current earnings per share of $3.38 increased 11.6% over the prior year.","Please refer to table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity, we generated approximately $450 million of cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with just over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. As a reminder, during the quarter we paid $50 million for the acquisition of Kirkhill and received approximately $61 million from the sale of Schroth.","This quarter-end cash balance does not reflect the payment of approximately $525 million for the acquisition of Extant which occurred in April. Our net debt leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1x pro forma EBITDA As Defined and gross leverage was 6.7x pro forma EBITDA. However, we expect this to increase very soon because we're active in the credit market and expect to raise $1.2 billion in new debt. We currently have adequate capacity to make $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity. This capacity grows steadily to over $2.5 billion as the year proceeds.","With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $15.54. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $17.67.","The decrease in GAAP EPS was due to the increase in acquisition related costs for our Kirkhill and Extant acquisitions, offset by the increase in EBITDA As Defined. The increase in adjusted EPS was primarily due to the increase in EBITDA.","Please see slide 9 for a bridge detailing the $2.13 of adjustments between GAAP to adjusted earnings per share related to our guidance.","Now, I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Before we open the lines, I would just like to ask each of you to only ask two questions and then please re-insert yourselves into the queue in order to give everyone the opportunity to ask a question.","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Nick and Kevin, congrats on the position changes.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Nick, I wondered if you can actually just elaborate on it, I mean, you \u2013 the press release states what you'll continuing to do. You listed those items in your prepared remarks but, I guess it's somewhat unusual to see a Chairman remain as involved as those items sound. So am I reading that correctly and can you just elaborate on why that's the transition strategy and exactly what we'll see you doing?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Noah, I don't know that I can say a lot more than we said in the press release. We also have a \u2013 I am asking \u2013 Halle, is the contract online yet?","Unknown Speaker","Yes. It is.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. We also have a contract. My contract and Kevin's contract which is \u2013 you can get on the SEC website now which maybe gives a little more color, but by and large, Noah, what you see is what you get. I mean those are the issues that I intend to stay pretty involved in.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So in four years time we will see you discussing M&A decisions and we will see you speaking to investors.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know how long I'll speak to investors. I am only kidding there. If you look at the contract, what it anticipates is, Halle correct me if I'm wrong on this exact number, either roughly about three and a half years anticipates that I would change to a Chairman rather than Executive Chairman with somewhat reduced duties. But I think the involvement in capital allocation and M&A decisions type of thing, I would think I would be involved for a while, for a considerable time.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Got it. And then in the aerospace aftermarket, in the air transport piece, I guess, if freight is part of that and I guess it sounds like freight is the main reason that that's so far above trend, is that right? And, I guess, what are you seeing just in the pure passenger air transport ex-freight piece of the aftermarket business?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Noah, I tried to give a little color on that in my prepared remarks. The largest piece of commercial transports for the aftermarket is the passenger side. We've said that's about 60% of our revenue, freight is 15%. So it's a smaller piece. The passenger segment is performing slightly better than our original guidance. The freight is performing well above and the interior side is above what we expected. So that kind of gives you the color. The commercial transport passenger piece is performing very well in line with our three year average and slightly better than our original guidance.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Is there anything that's...?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So maybe just to clarify on that, Noah, just for \u2013 I'll give you the \u2013 the three, when he says the three, you mean the last three that we published.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That was about 10%.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think what we mean is it's a little better.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So that piece is relatively in line with air traffic growth plus price right now. It's not way off of that trend line.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I believe that's true.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay, thanks a lot.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Nick, I wondered if you could just expand a little bit on Extant and the thought process around that model? Is there anything else in the TransDigm portfolio that resembles how that business seems to work and how should we think about the difference between price and what I guess is a \u2013 I don't know how you would refer to it, a decay rate or something of that nature, I mean, presumably you get a certain number of those platforms that fall off. I mean, you said it's pretty military heavy, so I don't imagine that's a big rate. But, how should we think about how to translate that business model into the TransDigm that we know?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. We don't want to get too specific on individual operating units, but you're right, there is some rate of underlying decay. It's actually quite low. And you can guess why, it's a question of the platforms and there's a lot of military. We think it's a good solid proprietary aftermarket business with a very good margin potential.","I would say when you look at this business, you're buying two things essentially, you're buying a portfolio of product and licenses and you're buying a platform and that's the way you have to look at the value. And I would say if the portfolio of existing products and licenses would generate an okay return, but it wouldn't \u2013 we're paying somewhat for a platform that we think can continue to buy these small product lines and licenses.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Does your scale and customer reach help with that value proposition relative to where the business was before I would assume so.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I would hope so, but we didn't value any of that.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks for the color.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I would look that as maybe upside. But there is no value in there for that. As you know, Carter, we pretty well value what we see not what other things we might imagine.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Not what you can imagine? Okay. Great, thanks for the color guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. This is Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Kirkhill seems to be a different type of acquisition than what you've typically done. It's a fixer upper and has been a problem for Esterline. What makes you confident that you can turn this business around? And also should we expect to see you acquire more fixer upper businesses in the future?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Let me answer them in inverse order as to whether we acquire more fixer upper, as you know, if something meets our criteria, we look at it as deal at a time. If it's got proprietary aerospace with decent aftermarket, then the question is does the price justify the return, we think we can get there. So I don't know how to answer that other than we surely will evaluate them. We're not unhappy with low performing businesses that meet our criteria if we can get them at the right price.","As far as are we confident in it? Yes, we're quite comfortable that we get our PE-like return on it. As you saw, we bought a $90 million in revenue for about $50 million. That's a significantly lower price than you generally pay, but we're quite comfortable we get our PE-like returns out of this and I would think we could exceed that.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good morning. And, congratulations, Nick and Kevin.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I just wanted to first ask, on the commercial aftermarkets, there has been some discussion from some of your peers about a sense that airlines are maybe looking to or airlines are building inventory levels again on spare parts and not necessarily restocking aggressively, but they've highlighted a change in sentiment amongst airlines as how they view inventory and some of their purchasing patterns. And I'm just curious if you are sensing this, obviously the results you put up sort of double-digit for the passenger side are encouraging, but have you sensed a change in airline purchasing behavior that may be contributing to this?","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not that we've seen so far. It doesn't mean that it's not contained in the numbers, but I don't have any additional color on airlines and their purchasing habits and how it's changed or not and any inventory stocking. We don't track that necessarily. We only look at the distribution side and of course our total commercial aftermarket.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And just as a follow-up, obviously, with the announcement this morning on KLX and Boeing, I don't imagine that impacts your business too much directly, but if there's any impact there if you could comment? But then more importantly, it seems like you're reassessing some of your distribution strategy and if you could just talk a little bit about that and moving forward if there's any \u2013 does that represents any shift in how you think about distribution for the commercial aftermarket relative to direct sales?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. So with the KLX acquisition, KLX is not a significant partner of ours across the ranch. We do have some limited distribution business with them, but not a significant portion. As you know, they're more of a fastener and commodity supplier or distributor. So, it doesn't necessarily overlap with us. What was your secondary question on that?","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes. I was just curious if you're changing your strategy around distribution at all or how you look to partners with distributors to maybe just get a little better value in the marketplace?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","The way our model operates is we give autonomy to our individual business locations. So they are the ones who drive the relationship with distribution partners and they are free to reevaluate and look at options in the marketplace. We look at distributing a highly engineered sole source product is unique and brings special criteria along with it. So, we certainly look for opportunities and advantages in the marketplace. We have no ongoing strategy to evaluate and move from one distributor to another, but we let our individual sites make that decision based on what they think is best for their business.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Well, thank you very much and really nice quarter. Thank you.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And congrats as well from me.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So, two things. One on M&A. But, before I get to that, if we look at slide 6 and your slight changes to the expected growth rates for the three main end markets, so commercial OEM, aftermarket, defense, two of those are going up. Is that on volume or is any of that the effect of pricing from the recently acquired sales?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. It's not because of the recently acquired sales; it's because of true volume. We commented on the defense bookings being up quite a bit and that that we believe would help us in the second half on the defense side and the commercial aftermarket with a year-to-date up 13% as we've stated, it's hard to \u2013 we moved it up slightly because of that. But it's not because of acquisitions; it's because of what we're observing in the business, base business.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I guess I should also ask is...","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Let me just add, on the acquisitions Rob, that's not to say that there may not be opportunities there. It's just that, by the time you get them implemented and work through the backlog, you're not going to see much of a dip this year.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. But it's mostly volume driven whether it's acquisition or not?","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. I would say the change, in other words, there is no change in pricing philosophy or targets. So, I guess, you would say that's mostly volume driven.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Well, right. But I also know that in your compare when you do the pro formas, you put in last year's sales at the old pricing schematic under the prior ownership as though you had owned it and then this year...","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","What I am saying \u2013 for M&A \u2013 the impact of the M&A there, whatever we might do, by the time you work through the backlog it likely doesn't impact this year much.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, fair enough. That makes sense.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We didn't take them over until \u2013 you're into April already, so by the time you get around to doing something and you're past that...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Year end of fiscal 2019.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, okay. And then the other question is just with regard to what's going on, the changes to the supply chain being imposed by the OEMs. Does that in any way, shape or form \u2013 it's a little bit like a question that was asked earlier, change the M&A opportunity set? In other words, are there more Kirkhills out there because those businesses won't be able \u2013 those management teams won't be able to comply with what Boeing is asking them to do and so maybe they are better in your hands or the opposite? I'm just wondering how much of this changes your M&A opportunity what's going on in the industry right now.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't have an answer to that Rob. I doubt it makes much difference, but we'll have to see what unwinds and how it evolves. It would surprise me if it makes a lot of difference, but we'll see.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Would you say there are more properties becoming available?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I surely haven't seen that yet and that's hard to predict.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. Well, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks so much. Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First of all, on the wide bodies, it seemed like it came in a little bit below your expectations for the quarter. Is this just timing or is there anything unusual there with regard to destocking perhaps from Airbus and Boeing?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I believe it's timing related. We haven't seen any appreciable changes in our shipset content. So I think it's just timing of the changes that have finally rippled through the supply chain to us. I would say that what I've seen on the bookings as well as on the sales side, we see the same weakness in bookings on the wide-body side as we have in the sales. So this is \u2013 it's a wide-body phenomenon tied to production rates and timing of programs. This is not a long-term problem for our shipset content.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, secondly on the aftermarket, you mentioned you are being conservative. It's not got the best visibility, the aftermarket in the second half of the year. But is there any sort of, again, sort of unusual one off things that you might want to call out with regard to what the growth rate could be in the second half?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","There is nothing specific that comes to mind. This is business that's largely book and ship within the quarter so it depends on the need in the market. I will say that as we look at customer or our distribution pass-through sales what we call POS or point-of-sale information, that is up about low double-digits just like our aftermarket is year-to-date. So it seems to go hand-in-hand that the demand exists for our product in the aftermarket and we're servicing it. So this is book and ship business. Largely within the quarter you don't get a lot of visibility out many quarters on the aftermarket side, but it is encouraging. Now that POS information I just gave was, that is for about 30% of our aftermarket business, about 25% to 30% of our commercial aftermarket goes through distribution, the rest of it is direct. So it's a nice leading indicator of what's happening in the market.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes, thanks. Good morning and congrats to both of you, Nick and Kevin.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","I was hoping you could elaborate on what you're seeing on the defense side. I thought I heard you say that bookings were exceeding sales year-to-date by over 20%, maybe I misheard that. But if you could elaborate on what you're seeing, is it broad-based, is it kind of confined to one or two major product categories? I remember, in the past you've had like these episodic parachute sales or what have you that...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. We've seen some episodic parachute sales in the past. We've seen specific strength out of a few large programs. So I anticipated this question and went and looked, and we have some large bookings for the future for some businesses. But I would tell you there is strength across the board. I think this is coming not from one or two businesses due to strength in parachutes or a specific program, it's general defense market strength both on the OEM and aftermarket side.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And is it about equally \u2013 is it about equal across OEM and aftermarket in terms of the rate of bookings growth versus sales or is it more keyed to the aftermarket? (00:45:21)","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","They're both in the same range of north of 20%.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, wow. And then just as a follow up on the discretionary interiors market, that's been lagging for a while. Do you have any better sense as to what is driving that and what is going to drive a turn in that? Like what's going on...?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I have some thoughts on that. I think, we look \u2013 number one, we look at the peers in this sector, and the peers that we follow are seeing something similar. I think there was a lot of rebranding and consolidation in the industry that drove some interior \u2013 discretionary interior spend. It was very strong a few years ago for a three-year period, and then we saw weakness as we discussed last year.","We are seeing something around guidance which we gave was flat \u2013 more or less flat, up a little. That's the guidance we gave and that's what we're seeing. So I don't have any additional color on that. It is also being hit by some wide-body business here as well. But in general, the interiors market, we're performing much like our peers in the industry.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I might just add, if you remember we went through it last year and we posted this. It was running red hot for about three years...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...at an unsustainable rate of growth.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","That's a fair point. Maybe just one last one. I'm curious if you guys have seen any evidence of kind of increased second sourcing across your portfolio, where \u2013 whether it's an OEM or... (00:47:14)?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I have not seen an increase in second sourcing with our products. We hear about this in the industry as a whole, but I've not seen any change to the dynamics for our specific industry, highly-engineered sole source products. We're not seeing a change \u2013 noticeable change to that.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks, guys. Best of luck.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Wanted to ask about the adjusted EBITDA margin. So in the quarter they were up around 100 basis points. I would have thought actually, given the mix, the strength in the aftermarket, you would actually see more of an increase. And then it looks like you \u2013 if you take the midpoint of your adjusted EBITDA guidance, it looks like you've actually lowered the margin outlook for the year. Is that just layering in Kirkhill?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. The margin decrease in the guidance is a reflection of the Kirkhill and Extant. Those margins are substantially lower than the TransDigm, and they have brought it down a little less than about a point (00:48:34)","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","As far as the mix...","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, go ahead.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","As far as the mix, with our margins, it's kind of hard to move the needle. So, it takes a substantial mix shift up to change our margin numbers.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So they were in line with what we thought they would be.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I guess another one for you, Jim. Tax rate, I know you commented on this year. Any thoughts on what your go-forward rate in 2019. When you have a full year of tax reform, what that could look like, given the interest rate deductibility cap?","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. We think that's going to get basically closer to where we've been historically, not this year but previous years, all right; maybe slightly better, but pretty close to where we've been historically. But we get a nice bump this year with the tax reform, but once the tax law changes take effect next year, I think we're going to get back to where we've been historically.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So around 30% you're implying?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, no, no. Closer to \u2013 no, closer in the 25% give or take.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","A couple of points.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right.

Did you say, Extant's margins were substantially below the TransDigm average...","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm looking at both combined.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And the Kirkhill one is what's giving the dilution there.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's what I thought just wanted to clarify. Then just a follow up on the OEM wide-body slowdown. I guess, it's been a couple of quarters of this kind of timing in inventory issue. So, are you assuming that concludes and what else gets better? I think you're implying OEM growth in the back half of the year. So I guess, what changes worth what you've seen recently.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not positive what changes except that the slowdown will \u2013 we will start to lap it year-over-year. So, you will start to see some changes in the comparables. As we look at the OEM order book, we still see some softness due to wide-body. But believe that, the industry as a whole will start to recover in the second half and that we should see some subtle movement there .So, that's all we're looking for. I don't have any better guidance than to say, I \u2013 that's what the market would seem to indicate to us.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Drew Lipke from Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure. Good morning.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","I was curious as we see greater use of flight hour agreements with airframe OEMs and component OEMs at a fixed cost to the airlines. How do you guys think about the impact of TransDigm over time from this kind of evolution that we're seeing?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not sure what the question is.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Can you repeat the question; we were having a hard time hearing the beginning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Yes. So, as you see greater use of flight hour agreements with both airframe OEMs and component OEMs, where we're seeing fixed cost to the airlines under these fly hour arrangements, what do you expect the impact to be on your business? Are you seeing greater sales directly either to a tier 1 on an airframe OEM on new generation aircraft because of these agreements, and how do we think of that evolution?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're not seeing any changes to the market dynamics or anything dramatic in the channels that we would sell through to reach the airlines and the end customers. So, no changes that we've seen and I don't know how to speculate on how that will impact us. I just fall back on highly-engineered sole source products that have significant aftermarket, parts need to be repaired, they wear out. I don't see any changes to that fundamentally yet in anything that we're observing.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And as we look at vertical integration, Boeing is looking to take or make laboratories on their own for the 737. And as we see moves in-house like that, how does that impact operations such as Adams Rite and your water faucets and systems business? And how do you guys think about that threat of vertical integration?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not sure I see a threat to us necessarily in that. There is always going to be opportunities in the aftermarket and on this vertical integration. I'm not sure I see \u2013 we will respond to it as we see it .Right now, I'm not seeing any changes. Again, sole source highly-engineered products they have to get them from someplace. We'll be ready to supply as the market needs dictate and will respond to it as we see it. I don't know how \u2013 without wildly speculating on things that I don't really understand or know how they will change, I don't know what to say beyond that.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Nick, just a quick one; and congrats to both of you also. Nick, any changes in kind of your discussions with Boeing on their partnering for success, or any update there you could give us.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It continues. The discussion continues. We're moving along in sort of a typical kind of negotiation. I think whatever concludes, it's unlikely that we'll say anything about it as we did before. These typically conclude with the confidentiality agreement.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I suspect this will be the same.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick one, just we've heard some other suppliers talking about the impact of higher commodity prices. Could you just remind us how that \u2013 how the price cost mix? I assume a lot of it's pass-through for you, but (00:55:32)","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","A lot of it is pass-through, and we've seen some commodities moving price and others go in the opposite direction. I think we're not observing across the board a runaway on commodity prices. Again, we are in a highly value-add environments with our highly-engineered products. So, we tend to see commodity changes and then \u2013 of course, that is an opportunity to value price as well, as you go forward. But we're not seeing runaway prices on the commodity side driving any change in behavior internally for us or with our customers.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think just mathematically, given the diversity of our products, I don't think there's any one commodity that can materially impact that \u2013 can (00:56:32) make a material impact on it (00:56:33)","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I agree.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. Nice quarter, guys.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Look, when you guys talk about a tax rate in the 25% range, does that include the foreign direct intangible credit?","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the answer to that question.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Last quarter we said that our tax rate is going to be with the impact of tax reform, somewhere a little bit higher than the statutory rate of 21%. We didn't give an exact range. But depending on \u2013 we're intending to do a new (00:57:28) financing and we'll see what that impact is. But it will definitely be lower than what our historical rate had been, but just slightly above the 21% range.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So closer to the 21% and 25%.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","In somewhere within that range, 21% to 25%.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Plus state. You got to add a little bit more for the state tax. That's just a final (00:57:52)","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Excellent. Great. Thanks. And then, just one follow up, something I've been curious or probably should have known already. Kevin, in the operating model when you guys operate and integrate decentralized way, do you guys spend much time focusing on trying to leverage the information about customers that you have in one part of the business to use another parts of the business, to go out and find opportunities for sales?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Leverage is maybe not the right word. We share information as is necessary to help develop products and respond to the needs of our customers. Leverage isn't the right word there; necessarily, it has other connotations. But yeah, we work together, we share information, we have quarterly meetings where people address what they're seeing in the marketplace and request from specific customers that might be of interest. That's what we do. We definitely share information. We're not trying to reinvent the wheel as you go site-by-site.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Just was curious about a few other things. Going back to Kirkhill, the seller there specified kind of in detail that the reason it was loss making was, there was a decent amount of competition, there was a decent amount of bill to print work, and there wasn't very much aftermarket. And so, are your comments that are pretty counter to that, that you can change those things or are you actually just disputing that assessment of the business?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We just have a different view of that, Noah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I guess, I just leave it at that.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Of the business as it is today.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. On the interest expense guidance reiteration, is that margin to market for LIBOR today, and the reiteration is just the changes you've made to structure and rate?","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. Yes, that reflects the current LIBOR rate.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Didn't you step it up some? I remember... (01:00:13)","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We stepped it up. Yeah, yeah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It steps up through the year.","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. We are averaging 1.8% LIBOR is what we have in our guidance.","(01:00:22)","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Last quarter we said 1.7%, it's going to step up to 2.4%","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's where you figure it will be by the end of the year?","James Skulina - TransDigm Group, Inc.","By the end of the year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Interesting.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And Noah, as Jim mentioned, the hedges kicking in too.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Right. Okay. Great. And just one other, if I could. In the defense business, the bookings strength that you've noted, what kind of conversion time do you expect from that booking strength?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We allow our businesses to book out a year and a half to two years. So it takes a little while. It's all program-specific shipments and orders, so it could take a little while to see all that convert.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's kind of interesting because you've raised to mid-single-digit growth for the year, so you'd have to be kind of through \u2013 kind of above 5% in the back half of 2018 to be at, call it, 5% for 2018. So you're sort of guiding to an acceleration in the growth rate back half of 2018 versus second quarter, but it sounds like that's despite this booking strength really being more of a 2019 event. Am I calculating that right?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think some of the bookings could be in 2018. Certainly, most of them will be in 2019. That's the booking profile that you have on the defense side. It tends to go out a little further. We will believe in raising our guidance to the mid-single-digit range. We anticipate some strength in the second half, that's right.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's just math.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Great. Thanks so much.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you, and I'm showing no further questions at this time, and I'd like to turn the conference back over to Liza Sabol for any further remarks.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'd like to thank you all for calling in this morning again.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you. Welcome to TransDigm Group, Incorporated third quarter \u2013 excuse me \u2013 thank you for calling in today, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie. A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. Details are contained in this morning's press release on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, we would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to our latest filings with the SEC, available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","We would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release or a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks everybody for calling in. Today, I'll start off as always with some comments about our consistent strategy. I'll give a little color on our commercial aftermarket business and a few other topics relating to Q3. I'll summarize the Q3 2017 performance and give some color on the guidance. Kevin will then give a significantly more detail on the operations in Q3, and Terry will run through the financials.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and about three-quarters of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Over half of our revenue and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced higher margins and have provided relative stability through the cycles. Our long-standing financial goal is to give our shareholders, over time, private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To meet this goal, we have to stay focused on the details of operating management and value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet and allocation of our capital.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our three value driver concept. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that is closely aligned with our shareholders.","Fourth, we acquire a proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to PE like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our effort to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely in our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have four and our priorities are typically as follows. First, investing in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy and where we see our rigorous return requirements are met; third, give the money back, extra money back to the shareholders either through special dividends or stock buybacks, and lastly, pay-off debt. Given the low cost of debt, especially after-tax, this is still likely our last choice in today's capital markets.","Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner that we think has the best chance to maximize the return to the shareholders.","To the point of capital allocation, fiscal year 2017 is a slower year for acquisitions. As a result, with our financing announcement of today, we expect to give back to our shareholders in fiscal year 2017 almost $3 billion or between $50 and $55 a share through a mix of special dividends and buybacks. This is almost 20% of the market cap at the start of fiscal year 2017.","Our liquidity is strong and the credit markets continue to be very attractive. After this next anticipated payout, we will still have significant acquisition capacity and our acquisition capacity grows steadily through the year. Terry is going to give you a little more detail on that.","To update you on a few recent items of significance in the third quarter, first let me address the commercial aftermarket. Commercial transport sized airplanes make up over 85% of our commercial aftermarket. We saw a 7.5% pickup this quarter in our total commercial transport aftermarket, that is passenger, freight and interiors revenues. In spite of a continuing down drag from reduced interior retrofit, our revenues and our two primarily interior businesses.","The biz jet GA and helicopter aftermarkets were down significantly in Q3 versus the prior year. In total, commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 5% versus prior year Q3. Year-to-date total, in total commercial aftermarket bookings continue to run ahead of shipments.","For the full year, though we could get close, I think it's unlikely that we get to mid single digits full year commercial aftermarket growth. The combined commercial transport aftermarket will exceed the 5% full-year growth and if it was not for the softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits, it could be well above. However, the discretionary interior business continues to decline more than we expected at the start of the year or at midyear. Also the business jet and helicopter market is softer than we originally anticipated.","Kevin is going to expand on this in some detail. He's going to try a new format. We'll see how it works. This generally follows our recent presentation on real growth. We'll decide in the future whether to continue using this format.","As an update on our government business. To remind you, direct sales to the U.S. government make up about 7% of our revenue, that's both directly and through distributors or brokers. The IG or Inspector General office informed us and has now made public that due to congressional inquiry, they have initiated an audit of government buying agency compliances with contracting procedures for certain TransDigm awards. We will cooperate fully as we have done in the past with these. We have been in contact with the IG office to offer our cooperation.","As I mentioned last quarter, these audits are common in the industry and are typically audits of the internal government purchasing procedures. I can't comment any more specifically. These audits typically go slowly. This will likely take well over a year to conclude. I will not comment further on this unless we decide public disclosure is appropriate.","In Q3, we completed the acquisition of three product lines for a little over $100 million. These product lines are all proprietary aerospace products with significant aftermarket. All three will be relocated to existing TransDigm businesses. To give a little more color, the mechanical actuator product line will be moved into our AeroControlex business in Ohio, the quick disconnect product line will be moved into our AdelWiggins business in California, and the data bus product line will be moved into our DDC business in New York.","We anticipate all three of these should well exceed our acquisition return criteria. Our acquisition efforts remain active. The pipeline is, as usual, mostly small and midsize businesses and as usual closings are always tough to predict.","A quick overview of the third quarter. On a same-store basis and assuming we owned the same mix of businesses and both time periods, commercial OEM revenues were slightly down. In Q3 versus the prior year, commercial transport revenues were up a little, but the continuing soft business jet and helicopter revenues pulled the overall down.","As I said before, the total commercial aftermarket was up 5% in the quarter and is now up about 2.5% on a year-to-date basis. Defense revenues continued to be better than we originally forecast in both shipments and bookings. EBITDA As Defined operating margins were strong and up in both Q3 and year-to-date. We are leaving our full-year guidance unchanged. So far this year, we have increased EBITDA As Defined guidance about $20 million since our initial guidance. This was primarily due to improved operating performance.","The midpoint of the 27 (sic) [2017] revenue guidance remains at $3.55 billion. The midpoint of the EBITDA As Defined remains at $1.7 billion and the midpoint of the EPS as adjusted remains at $12.21.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following slightly revised growth rate assumptions with minor puts and takes. The commercial aftermarket revenue growth is now anticipated to be in the low to mid single digits versus prior year. Again, the business jet and helicopter market and the discretionary interior retrofit is pulling this average down a bit. This is a modest decrease from our last quarter.","The defense and military revenue is up in the low to mid single-digit percent versus prior year. This is an increase in our assumptions from the last quarter. Commercial OEM revenue growth is now anticipated to be in the low single-digit percent. This is also down a little from our original assumption to start the year. The business jet and helicopter market continues down and the commercial transport is a little soft.","In summary, Q3 was a strong quarter and the first three quarters of 2017 were solid. It looks like for the full year, commercial revenues will be a little lower than we originally anticipated, but this will be primarily offset by higher defense revenues.","And with that, let me hand this over to Kevin.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone. As Nick stated, Q3 of fiscal year 2017 was a strong quarter. Now let me touch on the details of the quarter and provide some color where necessary.","For Q3, total company GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong, with revenue up about 14%, EBITDA As Defined up over 15%. EBITDA As Defined was strong at 49% of sales. The strength in EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of sales was due to the continued realization of our value drivers concept across our core or base businesses and the continued integration of recent acquisitions.","Now, let's review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide color commentary on a pro forma basis versus prior year Q3. In the commercial market which makes up about 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket.","In our commercial OEM market, revenues were down slightly, less than 1%, compared with Q3 of fiscal year 2016 and down even less year-to-date. Commercial transport OEM revenues which make up most of our commercial OEM revenue were up slightly versus prior year Q3 and by a similar amount year-to-date.","As we have said previously, inventory management by our OEM customers, much of which appears due to rate reductions on wide-body platforms, have created headwinds in the commercial OEM market. We will continue to watch trends for any indication of sustained weakness to further modify our cost structure as necessary. Business jet and helicopter revenues make up about 15% of our commercial OEM revenues. In total, year-to-date revenues in this market remain down mostly compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016.","No sustained recovery in this market has yet been observed. Although, new business awards and bookings continue for key future platforms such as Cessna Longitude, General Dynamics G500 and G600, and the Bombardier Global 7000 and 8000.","Now moving onto our commercial aftermarket business. As Nick has already summarized, total commercial aftermarket revenue and bookings expanded by about 5% in Q3 fiscal year 2017, when compared to prior year Q3.","Now, let me provide a little color on our commercial aftermarket business. As we have discussed recently, we split the total commercial aftermarket into four pieces in an effort to provide color and clarity on this important market for TransDigm. Please see the year-over-year commercial aftermarket revenue growth chart on page 6 in our earnings call presentation materials on our website.","Commercial transport passenger aftermarket revenue is the largest market segment in our commercial aftermarket revenue, at about 60% of sales. For the current quarter, this slice of the commercial aftermarket business grew by a robust 12% when compared with the same quarter in fiscal year 2016 and year-to-date have expanded at 8%. This compares similarly to our previous three-year average growth at about 10%.","Now for the commercial transport interiors aftermarket, which accounts for about 10% of our total commercial aftermarket revenue. Q3 revenues declined by about 19% when compared with Q3 fiscal year 2016 and year-to-date of decline by approximately 14% compared to a similar period in fiscal 2016. This discretionary interiors market has had a very difficult year-to-date after experiencing robust growth of 14% year-over-year average for the last three years. Softness in this market can be traced to a decline in various fleet refurbishment projects.","Although we continue to win refurbishment orders for the future, they are now getting rescheduled or delayed and it is still unclear how long this lull will persist. For the commercial transport freight aftermarket, which accounts for about 15% of our average revenues in total commercial aftermarket, Q3 demonstrated robust growth of 9% year-over-year. Q3 was our first good quarter so far this year in freight.","Bookings as well have started to accelerate as year-to-date we are up in the freight aftermarket by approximately 18% when compared with fiscal year 2016. This is encouraging, though too soon to tell perhaps the freight aftermarket is finally showing signs of a slow recovery. Our proprietary Telair products are very strong, but we still see weakness in our non-proprietary containers and nets businesses.","To clarify then, commercial transport passenger, interiors, and freight pieces make up the commercial transport sub-segment we have reported on previously on our commercial aftermarket discussions. Finally, for the business jet helicopter aftermarket, which accounts for the final 15% of our revenue of our total commercial aftermarket, sales are down about 9% in Q3 and down about 5% year-to-date compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016.","Year-to-date, our order book is about flat with the same period a year ago. There is some indication that this market could improve in the future given business jet takeoff and landing cycles improvement in recent months, but as of yet we are not seeing this takeoff, no pun intended. And the aftermarket in the segment tends to go through the OEM and as such we do not have the same insight into this piece of the market.","So to summarize on our total commercial aftermarket, first passenger segment is demonstrating continued strength. Our freight segment is now showing some solid signs of recovery for these proprietary highly engineered products. And finally, business jet helicopter and our discretionary interiors market show no clear sign of a recovery as yet.","Now, let me speak about our defense market, which remains relatively unchanged at about 30% of our total revenue.","Nick has already reviewed our total defense revenues for fiscal year 2017 Q3. Again, this includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, which were up about 8% versus prior year Q3 and greater than 4% year-to-date. A solid story in both OEM and aftermarket segments of the defense market, although this uptick is largely spread across TransDigm businesses. Two locations do stand out. Whippany Actuation Systems had some large shipments for a new confidential OEM, defense opportunity and Data Device Corporation DDC for aftermarket shipments across a number of key platforms.","Total defense bookings continue to provide an encouraging narrative as bookings have grown about 7% year-to-date, compared to the same period in fiscal 2016. Fiscal year 2017 year-to-date OEM bookings have been bolstered significantly by the aforementioned large multiyear new product booking for Whippany Actuation Systems on that confidential platform and for Airborne Systems North America in Q3 for a large order from the U.S. Army for an RA-1 special operations parachute. As always, lumpy bookings in shipments like these are common in the defense market and caution must be used in forecasting off of a few data points.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q3 were non-cash compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses.","Our EBITDA As Defined of about $443 million for Q3 was up greater than 15% versus prior Q3. The EBITDA As Defined margin of about 49% of revenues for Q3. EBITDA margin, excluded the dilution from the impact of acquisitions purchased since 2016, and it was about 50%. This indicates that our base business continues to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers and recent acquisitions are coming up the curve quickly.","Finally, I thought I'd provide an update to our 2016 acquisitions. And to remind you, those were Breeze-Eastern, Data Device Corporation and Tactair, as these have now been in the family long enough to show some results, specifically our value-driver concept focused around profitable new business generation, productivity and our operations and value-based pricing. We will update on the more recent acquisitions at a future date once they have more time in the saddle.","We acquired Breeze-Eastern in January of 2016 and have successfully implemented our culture and value driver strategy across the fiscal year. As a reminder, Breeze is a leading global designer and manufacturer of high performance lifting and pulling devices for military and civilian aircraft and has a standalone operation in Whippany, New Jersey.","We continue to see good progress this year on all three of the TransDigm value drivers. We have streamlined our price lists, while extending more value added services in our aftermarket repair and overhaul offerings. Our productivity initiatives continue to gain traction, as the cost structure is now aligned with our TransDigm business model and has included significant cost reduction actions at Breeze-Eastern since the acquisition.","Business unit teams have been formed at Breeze involving a cross-functional customer support team structure. Overall, Breeze-Eastern continues to exceed our acquisition expectations, as our margins have expanded with value generation and EBITDA above our acquisition model.","Data Device Corporation located in Bohemia, New York on Long Island was acquired by TransDigm in June of 2016. As a reminder, DDC is the world leader in the design, manufacturer of high reliability data bus, motion control and solid state power controller products for aerospace and defense vehicles.","This capability allows them to deliver the smallest, lightest and highest performing products in the most cost-effective packaging for these applications in the aerospace market. DDC consists of six global manufacturing locations today in the U.S., UK and Mexico, including the recent databus product line acquisition. To date we have aligned the DDC structure with TransDigm's operating strategy and culture and have created focused product lines.","Around our value drivers we have implemented a head count reduction to better rationalize our cost structure and have additionally conducted an extensive review of pricing, contractual opportunities, and new product initiatives to drive value generation. Recent product development design wins have seen the continued migration of the DDC family of products into commercial applications with new design wins this year for 777X, which augment prior wins on the 777X platform and the A350 platforms. At just over one year under TransDigm, the DDC team has done an excellent job of integrating into TransDigm. The business margins have now expanded with value generation and EBITDA again ahead of our acquisition model expectations.","And finally on Tactair, which is a world-class designer and manufacturer of electromechanical hydraulic and pneumatic motion and fluid controls for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine industries. Tactair was acquired in September 2016 and over the past 10 months the company has made significant progress integrating itself into the TransDigm culture and adoption of our value drivers. The strong pre-existing management team has organized the business within the TransDigm structure around focused P&L units. EBITDA margins since acquisition are up significantly as a result of the successful rollout of our value-based pricing strategy, a broadcast reduction effort reducing both product cost and non-production spending, including a significant reduction in head count and a focus on the introduction of profitable new business.","To date, this acquisition has delivered value generation in EBITDA ahead of our acquisition model. So let me conclude by stating, all-in-all, Q3 of fiscal year 2017 was another solid quarter for TransDigm and our acquisitions made in 2016 have met or surpassed our acquisition performance in value generation models.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I will now review our financial results for the quarter. Third quarter net sales were $908 million or approximately 14% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions represented $87 million of the increase in sales.","Organic sales were approximately up 3% for the quarter. Our third quarter gross profit was $522 million, an increase of 18%. Our reported gross profit margin of 57.5% was almost 2 margin points higher than the prior year, primarily due to the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.2% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.8% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock compensation, SG&A was about 10.7% of sales compared to 9.7% of sales a year ago. The higher SG&A was primarily related to higher selling and admin costs of the recent acquisitions.","We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $31 million, up 26% versus prior year quarter. This is a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $11.2 billion in the current quarter. We still expect our full-year fiscal 2017 net interest expense to be approximately $600 million.","Moving on to taxes. In Q4 of fiscal 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for share-based payments, including stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments. As a result, our GAAP tax rate will now generally approximate our cash tax rate during an entire fiscal year.","Our GAAP effective tax rate was 28.1% in the current quarter compared to 17.3% in the prior year. The higher effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to a lower level of stock option exercises in the current year quarter. We now estimate our full-year GAAP tax rate to be around 27%. Our effective tax rate excluding the accounting standard charge has not change and is still estimated to be around 31%. To remind you, this is the rate we use in calculating our full-year adjusted EPS.","Our net income for the quarter increased $8 million or 5% to $169 million, which is 18.6% of sales. This compares to net income of $161 million or 20.1% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales and improvements in operating margin, partially offset by higher interest expense and the tax rate versus the prior period.","GAAP EPS was $3.08 per share in the current quarter compared to $2.88 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $3.30 per share, an increase of 6.8% compared to $3.09 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Now, switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $971 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our cash balance was impacted by two items Nick briefly mentioned. First, we spent $50 million of repurchase, approximately 206,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $243 per share. Second, we also paid approximately $105 million for the acquisition of the three product lines during this quarter. We have $600 million in undrawn revolver, $100 million available under our AR securitization and additional capacity under our credit agreement.","The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter-end was 6.1 times our pro forma EBITDA As Defined and gross leverage was 6.6 times pro forma EBITDA. As announced in our earnings release this morning, we plan to raise $1.8 billion on new-term loans with the proceeds to be used together with cash on hand to repurchase $1.2 billion of our existing tranche C term loans due in 2020 and to fund a potential special dividend in the range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion.","At September 30, 2017, assuming the completion of these transactions, we expect to have dry powder between $1 billion and $1.25 billion available for acquisitions. This capacity increases each quarter ratably and we expect this to increase to over $3 billion by the end of fiscal year 2018.","We expect our year-end cash balance between $500 million and $750 million and our net leverage to be between 6.4 times and 6.6 times at the end of the year, depending on the size of the dividend. In addition, we are seeking to amend our credit agreement to give us the option to buy back shares or pay a special dividend for the upcoming next 12 months.","With regards to our guidance, we still estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $9.28 and, as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $12.21. Please see slide 11 for a bridge detailing the $2.93 of adjustments between GAAP to adjusted EPS related to our guidance.","Now, I'll hand the call back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terry. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, I guess, how sustainable should we view this 8% in defense to be, because on the one hand, it seems like a lot of the fundamental drivers of that business for you are picking up meaningfully; on the other hand, it sounds like you're calling out maybe some one-time drivers in the quarter?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I guess \u2013 Noah, this is Nick. I think the best we can do there is give you the guidance for the year. I don't want to start to forecast into 2018 at this point. Yeah, but I'll say, we feel better about it than we did a year or two ago.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","The parachute piece that you called out specifically, I mean, if you look at that budget for the army and you mentioned the army there, that had a much greater than 50% peak to trough on you and it looks like it's actually scheduled to pick up significantly kind of starting now. So was that a one-time thing or is that actually just the beginning of a recovery in that market for you?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not sure. No, I'm not sure of budget, you mean the parachute budget?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Yeah, if you look at the U.S. Army parachute purchases.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the answer to that, yeah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","They're fairly active. That business is fairly active in bidding, but I don't know how it compares to the government budget.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So it's fairly active in bidding, it's not like you just got that one order and then it flattens back?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right. But that doesn't mean you win them.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sure. Okay. And then just on the aftermarket side of the commercial business, commercial aerospace aftermarket, is it possible to lay out for us \u2013 I know you gave us a lot of detail there. I appreciate the incremental detail. But is it possible to lay out in the interiors business and then in the business jet helicopter piece, when they first started declining or said another way, when you annualize the sharp rates of decline there? That way we could better understand when they stop being at least the sizable headwinds that they are today.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know \u2013 Kevin, let me try and if you have a different \u2013 well, let me take the business jet and helicopter. The biz jet helicopter business, Noah, continues to surprise us, and it's declined.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So my sort of forecast on where I think it is, I would \u2013 if I were you, I'd take with a grain of salt. I would say we don't get \u2013 as Kevin said, more of the aftermarket in the business jet world goes through the OEMs than it does in the rest of our business. So, we don't get a whole lot of clarity on it. And it can at times get a little confused with the OEM buys, you have to sort of parse it out and make a judgment on it. I don't know, that doesn't help you other than to say, it \u2013 on the interiors business, I'd like to say, Kevin, I don't think we feel comfortable that we're seeing a bottom there yet.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's right. And I would say, Noah, that started to alter itself this year.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So that's a relatively recent, but the business jet, that weakness has been ongoing. We're on the right programs, we're winning as I listed, the list of the key business jet for platforms for the future, it's any recovery there we're just not seeing yet.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So, the business jet helicopter piece you show up 2%, 2014 to 2016, so maybe that started to bleed on you in 2016 or even 2015, so not insanely difficult comparisons there, but still kind of bleeding lower. And then the interior piece being up 2014, 2014 to 2016 and then down sharply. Sounds like that's only two quarters, maybe three quarters in, so it's still another one or two quarters before that annualizes?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That seems reasonable. That seems reasonable.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I think, as Kevin pointed out, we're still seeing projects and activity things just ...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Absolutely.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Things just seem to keep getting delayed.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Or moving out.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Right. Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Hey, can we have a clarification on the orders for freight first. I think you said bookings were up 18%. Is that year-on-year, and is that year-to-date or in the quarter?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. So that's \u2013 the 18% is year-to-date.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Year-to-date. Well, okay. All right. And then the other one, Terry, the EBITDA margins, I think you had on the last call implied and certainly the guidance would imply a bit of a tick down in EBITDA margins as defined. And obviously they're pretty strong here, heading into fourth quarter and implies a 100 basis point sequential decline. Is that looking like conservatism to just offset if the sales for some reason don't come through where they are, otherwise it looks like there is not a real clear reason why the EBITDA margins would sequentially drop.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Myles, I think that's right. As we look at the order book and the backlog, we could \u2013 we may be better than what the midpoint that suggests that it coming down, but the highest would suggest that it will continue to be in that over 48% EBITDA margin area.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then there is one...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","There is nothing systematically changing in the business. If the margin's down a little, it just happens to be the mix of product that goes out that quarter.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Okay. And then the only last one on the defense side. Within the seconds, I think Kevin you mentioned both aftermarket and now we were strong, anyway to clarify which was stronger and by how much?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","They are both- sorry, they're both comparable.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Terry, one for you. I didn't have a chance to work through all the math on the cash balance, but are you implying any sort of change in the underlying free cash flow guidance for the year, which I think you were targeting around $800 million?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, no, there is no change and we look at from a free cash flow is trying to hit 50% of our EBITDA after taxes, interest, and CapEx. The interest is running higher this year, we maybe a touch under that, but it should be pretty close to that 50% from the free cash flow standpoint, which gets you in that $800 million to $850 million range, as we kind of define free cash flow.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And thinking about the way forward, Nick, what would prevent you guys from being able to grow adjusted EBITDA leased in kind of the low double digit range on a go-forward basis?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think, David. I don't want to get backed in to next year's guidance, that's \u2013 I think we'll put that out when we put it out. We gave you in the last quarter our view of sort of a [long, four or five year trends in that, but I think next call we'll put the guidance out.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Last one, Nick. You've been pretty consistent and been a little cautious on the commercial cycle overall. Obviously, there is some destocking going on right now, but how are you feeling about kind of the sustainability of the commercial cycle at this point? We've obviously had really good traffic numbers here for quite a while.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, you know at the \u2013 this is always a risk. The absent of destocking, I think we probably feel better about it now than we did 18 months ago.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Whether that translates into anything, who knows, but.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thank you. Good morning. Nick, can you give us little more color, just a little bit on the discretionary interior stuff? It is presumably just an extension of some of the cabin aesthetics that you guys talked about last quarter. Is there a concern that this is maybe a leading indicator for airlines then, like what you guys have seen throughout the course of the history of your company you see, like it starts with discretionary and then usually the cuts and it's going a little bit deeper. How should we think about this patch of softness vis-\u00e0-vis, sort of I don't want to say canary in a coalmine per se, but is it a leading indicator for an expectation that maybe there is going to be more to come?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kevin, you want to take it?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Hunter, this is Kevin. So when we look at it, the OEM business and the repairs business continues to march along. It's really the refurbishment that a united continental rebranding sort of idea. And those tend to go through peaks and valleys. We've seen this when we evaluated businesses for acquisition that they go through peaks and valleys.","So we're still winning future refurbishment orders. I referred to that in the \u2013 in my words prepared, but we continue to win those. I don't see any reason why in the future those won't return. We are seeing opportunities though on refurbishments on some of the low cost airlines around the world, in the Middle East, Asia, India. So there is still opportunity there, I think which is going through a low timing right now.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, I apologize if I missed this in my last question. Did you disclose what underlying organic gross margins excluding the acquisition dilution?","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","He's talking about EBITDA.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think we said there about 100 basis points higher than the (43:41) average.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","100 basis points. Okay, great. Thank you. That's it. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Peter Arment with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Nick, just kind of a just high level question on kind of the M&A. You mentioned it's down, it's obviously down pretty considerably over the last several years, is it just purely timing, and this is M&A, or did you lose out in some deals, or your just not liking the properties that you're seeing, maybe just a little color on the M&A environment.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. One, I don't think it's down in the last couple of years. I think the year before was pretty heavy. I think we bought a ballot...","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right. No, no, I agree with you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","In 2017, my general view is across the industry it seems to be slow, the M&A activity. I mean, we have \u2013 we see things, but generally the things we like either have been small. I can't really say we didn't like the prices. I mean, we walked away from that region. I would say mostly the things that we haven't bought, it's because they weren't proprietary enough.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Just not fitting the business model.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Just not fitting the model, and we're \u2013 we ultimately will need to stretch it. I think we generate plenty of cash and capacity, and as we say, we don't see something that meets the model. We tend to give the money back to the shareholders, and we're pretty confident that if we need the money later, we'll have it and we'll find a way to come up with it.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just a follow-up there, Terry to that, could you just mention what's the pro forma leverage you expect after the special dividend?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","we'll be at probably just under 7 times gross and 6.8 net, and that...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That will be based on the 9\/30.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, September.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I mean June.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That will be at June and then at September, that will go down to, net down will between 6.4 and 6.6 depending on the size of the dividend.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Nick, I wanted to ask you something high level as well. With all the supply chain discussion and some of the pressure that Boeing and other OEMs are imposing on the suppliers, or on certain suppliers, how do you think this affects the M&A environment? And I say this in the context of very large deals being discussed out there in the media. Do you see more consolidation at greater levels and is TransDigm a buyer or a seller in this environment?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I would say, Rob, the reality is, we are either. We are \u2013 we're pretty commercial and mercenary, as we should be as represented in the shareholders' money. I would say as a \u2013 let me \u2013 I don't know where this goes. Yeah, I \u2013 you might think it would generate some more activity, but I can't say it has. We surely haven't seen it. I've seen the same room or this big deal that you have. I think when we see something with the right value proposition, we're a buyer. And I don't think we're necessarily particularly capital constrained. But we're constrained by that we have to see our kind of return and fit our kind of profile, which is a fairly tight restraint.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","But do you think maybe this loosens some larger pieces that might not have been in within your traditional aperture?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Rob, I don't know. I can say we haven't seen it yet.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Maybe it's a little early for that.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Second question, and this could be for anybody. But back to something we talked about earlier in last time. Just the bookings versus the shipments and the math behind that might have implied a little bit better commercial aftermarket. Are we going to see these bookings numbers come through or am I thinking about it wrong? Do I look at your slide 6, that Kevin spoke to, and are the bookings really specific to the passenger business and you do it differently in interiors, which is why we don't see the pressure on the bookings that's translating into the pressure on the sales?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know that I can answer that. I think the one take it into pieces the passenger business, I think we feel pretty good about. I think the Interior business, we don't believe we've seen the bottom of that yet. And I don't think our bookings make us feel great about it. The bookings in the freighter business were pretty good. And I would say the biz jet, helicopter sort of the incoming work is probably roughly consistent with the outgoing.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I guess, Nick, what I'm saying is that the bookings that you've shown us throughout the year would have suggested we would not have a 19% drop in the commercial transport interior business, unless those bookings are excluded from the number of bookings, from, what is included in your bookings number?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not sure I follow the question, Rob. Everything is in our booking number.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So it's all there? So, okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's all there, there's nothing excluded from any of our bookings or our total bookings.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. So it goes back to \u2013 I can't remember the \u2013 I don't know if you've given the number for this quarter, but you had been sort of at 1.1 book-to-ship, at least up through the last quarter, but we haven't seen that 10% type of overall aftermarket growth, that would be implied by 1.1 book-to-ship?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not sure we're apples-to-apples, Rob, and I don't think I can answer your question here.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. We'll take it offline.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not that I'm unwilling to, it's just that I'm not sure.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No. No. It's complex and I think what it has to do with what's included in the bookings versus what's included in the sales, in the growth numbers?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So Rob because we were strong with some bookings number last quarter, you're expecting higher sales?","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Well, and I think it was more than just last quarter, I think it was the prior quarter, I mean the bookings have been coming through it, I think at a stronger level than the aftermarket sale. So I was asking you is that because the interior weakness is the difference and those bookings aren't counted the same way.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. All bookings are counted the same. All booking are counted the same.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks for trying.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys. A big picture question that maybe a more detailed question. So I guess it was last week Boeing announced that they're opening this avionics business and they're going to be a supplier. How do you think Nick that, that changes the dynamics in the supply chain kind of broadly speaking, , if they start to do actuators and other bits and pieces of airplanes. I mean, I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how do you think about that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","The real answer is, I don't where they go with it. I don't know what the impact is. So far, at least in the businesses that we're familiar with, anything they've done that with has been make the print non-proprietary stuff. I think it will be a tough row to hoe if they start to move into the proprietary kind of content. They got all kinds of agreements they're tangled up in and the like. Now, where it goes? I don't know. We haven't seen. We haven't really seen anything in our business jet. In non-proprietary things, you are probably going to be at risk.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. If I just kind of can dig down a little further. Why is proprietary going to be such a tough row to hoe for them? I mean, why is that safe to assume?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's \u2013 look, nothing is impossible. It takes a fair amount of engineering, typically the supplier owns the intellectual property. The requalification is fairly lengthy. They're typically tangled up in agreements by platform that get pretty ugly if you start to try \u2013 somebody started to try and pull out of them.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. Got you. And then, maybe just a more detailed question. When we look at, specifically the refurbishment business, is that work, A, being delayed, rescheduled, deferred, and is it coming specifically from one region or fleet type? So I guess what I'm driving at, do you think a lot of this is coming out of the Middle East, on wide bodies, is there any way you can speak to that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kevin.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","There is some softness in the Middle East on that. Certainly, some softness on the wide-body side, but it's specific to refurbishments, rebranding, it's significant fleet-wide overhauls that we're seeing the weakness.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And then maybe one last question. With the fleet of 787s kind of getting bigger out there where there's over 500 or so flying around and they've been in the fleet for a while, when do you expect to see some aftermarket on those airplanes pick-up?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We see some now, but I mean you can almost do the math. This isn't exact, but you can almost calculate the rate, which I just don't know as I sit here.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You can calculate the rate at which they get beyond about their five-year life and that's probably going to be a pretty good proxy for the aftermarket pick-up.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. So just typical standard...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","...is the way to think about it, yeah. Great, cool. Thanks, guys.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a follow-up on your comments on M&A, you said you didn't see enough proprietary deals or deals that meet your characteristics. Is that \u2013 would you categorize that as kind of the normal lumpiness of deal flow on a year-to-year basis? Or if you think about the medium and long-term opportunity, are you still seeing proprietary assets that make you have a rich pipeline for the next couple years?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Matt, I think so, but I say I think. One thing I know is predicting the closure rate of deals is difficult. I mean there's, you can easily come up with a list of attractive, medium or decent size things you'd like to buy, but will they close, will they come up for sale? At least this year, no.","In the past, we've seen this. I would say probably three years ago, we did almost nothing and then we had big years in 2015 and 2016, and this year is a little soft. One of the, I believe, attractiveness of our capital allocation mindset model is that we try hard to get the return back to the shareholders another way if we can't get it by buying stuff in the year.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right, great. And then just on the commercial transport interior business. Are you sure that's a market issue, or has there been any change in the competitive landscape there? I mean, is somebody else winning that work, or is it \u2013 are you pretty sure it's just project deferrals?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kevin, you going to take that?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's project deferrals. We haven't seen any indication that any significant pieces of business went anywhere else. It's simply delays of what we had expected.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. Probably never expected to spend so much time talking about interiors, but I'll ask one more. So the declines that we're seeing, why isn't this to some degree \u2013 I mean it seems over the past three years, this business is up 50%. Why isn't this to some degree just some mean reversion on project work that should be kind of lumpy? And if it's not that, then should we think about the interiors business typically as something that should be one of your best businesses, and grow well above average?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'll try that. The retrofit portion of the interior business is, over time, tends to be more cyclical than our other businesses because it's more discretionary. Over time I suspect if you take a long enough period of time, 5 or 10 years, I suspect it has on average the same kind of patterns as the rest of it, but it definitely, you can be lumpier.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And so if that's the case, if we've been up 14% on average for the past three years, maybe it's not so surprising to see what we're seeing now.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, you're going to see a downturn sometime when you're running 14% or 15% a year.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right, right. Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think I would say it came on frankly a little suddenly.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, it sort of slowed down kind of quick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kind of quick ...","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...but that's, no one blows the whistle before you hit the top of the market.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And is your direct customer here the airlines or is it another manufacturer or an MRO shop?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","The answer to that is all of the above.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay, okay. Nick, and then maybe one more, based on some of the slides you guys have disclosed recently, it seems like your pricing over a period of years in the cargo freight piece of the aftermarket is essentially zero. Can you talk about how that business kind of fits into your model given that sort of unusual pricing dynamic for a TransDigm end market?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I have no idea where you're getting those numbers, other than I don't. I don't know because I don't know. I would say in that business the Telair which is the bulk of the business, the Telair United States, is proprietary staff stuff and does reasonably well. The containers and the net business is nonproprietary and doesn't do as well. But I don't think the average is up down or zero.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay, yeah. I was looking at some of the real growth numbers you guys put out in the May slides and then what you've put out today for the pro forma.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. There're different timeframes.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Right. Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Maybe just, Terry, point of clarity, I don't know if I missed this. The free cash flow this year, $1.75 billion to $2 billion, but I think you said looking at the capacity going up to \u2013 or I'm sorry not the free cash flow issue, I'm looking at the capacity you said going up to $3 billion in 2018 versus what you guys would have in terms of capacity of $1.25 billion at the end of this year. So, how do we bridge that gap to get the $3 billion? I think your free cash flow is typically 50% of EBITDA, So what get you to $3 billion of capacity if I heard that right?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You also have to look at the EBITDA of the target, right. We would be able to pick up 7 times their EBITDA as part of an acquisition strategy, and that's part of the \u2013 to build up into that \u2013 into that number.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That helps. Okay. And then just maybe, Nick, one more on this interiors. If I go back to Rockwell Collins, it sounded like they were starting to see some of their backlog build for retrofit next year, and I think you just said you provide to all of the big manufacturers' airlines, retrofits, what's sort of you lead time, I mean if they're starting to see their backlog build, I mean how soon do you guys get orders ahead of a retrofit project?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, probably, and this is a real guesstimate, but I'd say six months-ish. The problem is with these programs is they tend to stretch out.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's the delivery \u2013 when they slow down, is they're going to do them in March, so you we expect the order in September and then suddenly March becomes May and May becomes July, and that's what we're seeing some of now.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Best we can tell, we don't have any projects dying.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. To follow-up on Rob Spingarn's question earlier, in the aftermarket, what is \u2013 when we think about book-to-ship, what is your average lead time for aftermarket order-to-ship timeline?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think, I can give you an average. I mean, it's kind of all over the map. Retrofits are different than spare parts, and that sort of thing. But I don't think it'd be \u2013 the average is kind of a meaningless number with all our product lines but maybe three, four, five months, something like that.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Also Nick, I think I heard you say on the biz jet side, it's hard to parse out what's aftermarket and what is OE sometimes. Is that because the pricing is the same and is the profitability the same on those sales?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. It depends on part number in the account. So the frequently the biz jet manufacturers control more of it than in other sectors. So when they order, yeah, to your point, you can always tell exactly what it's for. So sometimes it's hard to parse out inventory fluctuation from aftermarket fluctuation at the OEM, if you follow me.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yep. I understand. And any sense for how much of the biz jet aftermarket is falls into that more amorphous category? Is it like half of it or is that...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's more than half. We make our best judgment, and we try and do it consistently. The aftermarket OEM split, we have a consistent way we do it quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter to try and keep some legitimacy code. But there is a little \u2013 as Kevin said, there is always a little bit of a gray in there. But I don't think it changes the fact. I don't think it changes the fact that it's soft, whether it's soft by 2%, 5% or 7% you might argue.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. It makes sense. One last one just on the M&A pipeline. Over the next couple of years, do you think there is going to be better pipeline for defense related acquisitions or commercial aero, and do you think the valuations will be much different between the two segments?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I obviously don't know the answer to that. I would say, if you look over the last few years, there shortly have been more defense stuff came up than it had come up in the two or three years before that, and the price has moved up. Whether that will continue, I just don't know.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Drew Lipke with Stephens. Please proceed.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the time.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","One question just on the interior, just to round that out. How much of that business do you view as traffic or usage or maybe spares driven as opposed to how much is rebranding or refurbishment or retrofit, is it all retrofit?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, no retrofit. There is a \u2013 there is an existing OEM content, there is the repairs of things that get damaged during usage, which is kind of when you're referring to and then there is the refurbishments, rebranding, which are esthetic and take longer to plan out. So what goes through the wear and tear, that gets repaired as usual and we might expect that to follow with usage of the airlines.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","And do you know the percent mix between those?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I would be speculating, but I would guess it's probably a third. A third, a third, and a third, but I'm -that's up for revision I guess, as I dig into that, but that's my sub-thought at the top of my head there.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then just second question, I guess the last couple of quarters, you'd talked about look through sales that the distributors being up I think double digits. And I'm curious what sort of sell-in versus sell-through component did you see at the distributor level here in the quarter and did you see any kind of inventory build in the quarter?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It was similar to previous quarter. So, it was up as before we continue to trend upwards on the look-through sales. I didn't call it out this time, but it continues to move in the right direction.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I think what he is \u2013 Kevin is it true that the \u2013 there the increase year-over-year in their shipments for this quarter look relatively close to our increase year-over-year.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's right. That is true.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So, now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations for some closing comments and remarks.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you for participating on this morning's call, and please look for our 10-Q that we expect to file tomorrow.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference.

We'll have a question-and-answer session later and the instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Now, I would like to welcome and turn the call to Ms. Liza Sabol, Head of Investor Relations.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Carmen. I would like to thank all of you that called in today. And welcome you to TransDigm's fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie. A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. Details are contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements.

Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning. And thanks to everyone for calling in today. It looks like we got a pretty good crowd here calling in now. Today, as always, I'll start off with comments about our consistent strategy. I then like to give some color on both our military business and a few other topics relating to Q1. I'll then summarize the Q1 performance and an update on the guidance. Kevin will then go through some of the operating specifics for Q1, and Terry will run through the financials.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both net consistently and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and about three quarters of our sales come from products, for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Over half our revenue and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales have historically produced higher margins and provided relative stability through the cycles. Our longstanding goal is to give our shareholders over time, private equity like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet.","We follow a consistent long-term policy. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses, with significant aftermarket content. We have a simple, well proven value-based operating strategy, based around our three value-driver concepts.","Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that's closely aligned with our shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to private equity like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have four and our priorities typically are as follows. Our first choice is always to invest in our existing business and our second is to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. These are almost always our first two choices. Our third choice is to give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through special dividends or stock buybacks. And our fourth is to pay off debt. Given the low cost of debt especially after tax, this is likely our last choice in current market conditions.","Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner, we think, has the best chance to maximize returns to the shareholders.","Now to update you on a few items of significance from the first quarter. Because we've gotten a number of questions recently, I'd like to give you a little color on our military business. In fiscal year 2016, military revenues made up 30% of our reported sales, a relatively small portion of this was sold directly to the U.S. government. I'll break the 30% down a little, based on our best estimates of the 2016 reported revenues.","About 12% of our total revenues were sold to the domestic defense OEMs. This is a mix of sales primarily for both new airplane build and aftermarket sales. These are companies like, Lockheed, Boeing, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, UTC, et cetera. About 6% of our total sales were sold to foreign defense OEMs. This is also a mix of sales for both new airplane builds and some aftermarket. These are companies like, Airbus Defence, Dassault, Saab, Leonardo-Finmeccanica, et cetera.","About 5% of our total revenues are sold to friendly foreign governments either directly or through broker distributors. These are generally users of U.S. equipment, some examples include UK, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Denmark, just to name a few. About 5% of our total revenue or about $150 million is sold directly to the U.S. Government through various agencies, the largest direct supplier by a significant amount is the Airborne military parachute business that we acquired in late 2013.","About another 2% of our total revenue or somewhere around $60 million is sold to the U.S. Government through various brokers or distributors. This is spread over many of our operating businesses and a number of brokers and distributors. A substantial part of this revenue is sold to small disadvantage and\/or women-owned brokers or distributors in response to government buys directed to the small businesses. We do not own a whole or in part any broker distributor. Our only relationship is as a supplier.","We've also added a number of questions about the impact of potential income tax law changes. We, of course, have no idea what if any tax changes may ultimately come to fruition. As I'm sure you all know, the rumors change regularly. However, based on estimates of both the so-called House and Trump plan, it appears to us that for our 2016 reported income tax, our income tax would be no higher and would likely be a bit lower under either plan, and Terry will give you a little more detail on this.","In any event, at least as we understand the various tax proposals today, I think it's very unlikely that any of these changes would materially impact either our business or our capital allocation strategies.","This quarter, we were pretty active in the capital markets. In Q1, we raised about $1.2 billion of debt to both partially fund the special dividend and also to refinance some of our existing debt. We paid out a $1.4 billion special dividend for $24 per share to our shareholders. We also plan to take advantage of a continuing strong credit market in early Q2 to refinance about $1.2 billion of our term loans.","Our debt was trading a little over par. The purpose was to slightly reduce interest rates and, also, to extend the maturity. We did not intend to raise any new money at that time. When the stock dropped 10% on Friday, January 20, the debt traded down to par or slightly below. As a result, the expense to do the refi didn't make any sense with no interest rate savings; so, we put the deal on hold and will review the status regularly. Access to the market was not, and has never been, an issue. We simply just didn't see any savings and it wasn't worth the expense.","As we've explained in the past, about 75% of our debt is either fixed or capped. The net result is to significantly reduce our exposure to interest rate movements through 2020, at least. Terry, again, will give you a little more detail on this.","We bought about $150 million of our stock back after the drop in price on January 20, at an average price of about $225 a share. Since we were in a blackout period, we were limited to this $150 million by the 10b5 plan we had in place.","On December 31, 2016, that's the end of the quarter, our liquidity was strong. We had slightly under $1 billion in cash, about $600 million of open revolver, and additional room under our credit agreement. We believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions at this time. This grows steadily through the year. This does not imply anything about likely levels of acquisitions.","We also announced two new key management changes in the first quarter. Kevin Stein was named President and Chief Operating Officer. Kevin is now responsible for most of our operating businesses. Bob Henderson was named Vice Chairman. Bob continues to be responsible for select businesses, but is also working with Bernie and I on business development and other issues.","Our acquisition efforts remain active. The pipeline is, as usual, mostly small and mid-sized businesses, and closings are always difficult to predict. Now, Kevin's going to review a little detail on Q1 operating performance. But just to give a few comments, first, keep in mind, as you look at the Q1 versus the prior year Q1 comps, there are about 3% less shipping days in this year's Q1 versus the last. Though it's hard to exactly quantify the impact, this likely impacts our commercial aftermarket revenue comps more than other sectors.","In total, Q1 organic revenue was up 3.5% versus the prior year Q1, roughly in line with our full-year guidance. The commercial OEM revenues were a little soft. Commercial transport revenues were down modestly. Business jet revenues were down more significantly. Bookings were up year-over-year in the commercial transport sector; were, again, soft in the business jet market.","Commercial aftermarket revenue was up modestly versus the prior year Q1; however, on a very positive note, commercial aftermarket bookings or incoming orders were very strong. Bookings were also up significant sequentially and ran well ahead of the Q1 shipments. This is a good sign for the balance of the year.","The defense revenues were up about 2.5% versus the prior year Q1. Bookings were down, but this appears to be timing. Operating margins were strong and up versus the prior year, and we continue to execute on our steady value creation process.","Based on the Q1 full year results, our 2017 guidance, assuming no acquisitions or additional capital market activity in the fiscal year, is adjusted as follows. The midpoint of the fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance is now $3.55 billion. This is a slight increase of about $5 million versus the previous guidance. The midpoint of the fiscal year 2017 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now about $1.7 billion, an increase of $15 million from our previous guidance. This increase in guidance is due to the slight increase in revenue and a modest upward adjustment in our EBITDA margins.","The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $12.16 a share, up $0.18 from our previous guidance. This increase in guidance is also primarily due to the same reasons as the EBITDA: slight increase in revenue and a modest margin improvement. Terry will go through that in a little more detail.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is still based on the following growth rate assumptions. These are unchanged from our original guidance. Commercial aftermarket growth in the mid to high single digits; the strong bookings here are very encouraging. Defense and military revenue, flat to slightly up versus the prior year as a percent. Commercial OEM revenue growth in the low to mid single digit percent range. We're still assuming commercial transport unit airframe shipments are up in the low single-digit percents for 2018. We remain cautious about 2018 rates. Business jet shipments and bookings bear watching. We have significant cash and available borrowing. These continue to grow through the year, and Terry will expand on that. In summary, Q1 was a good solid start to the year.","And now, Kevin?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. I'm going to provide a little more color with respect to Q1 fiscal year 2017 performance. First off, Q1 generally has about 10% less shipping days than the other three quarters of our fiscal year. But as Nick has stated previously, Q1 of fiscal year of 2017 had an additional 3% decrease in manufacturing days due to our holiday schedule and any planned plant shutdowns. As Nick stated earlier, the exact impact of this decrease is difficult to quantify across our operating units.","For Q1 details, total company GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong, with revenue up 16%, EBITDA As Defined up 21%. Organic revenue was up 3.5% for the quarter versus prior-year quarter, and EBITDA As Defined was strong at 47.3% of sales. The strength in EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of sales was due to a mix shift to a higher aftermarket sales content.","Now, let's review our revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus prior-year Q1; that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods, like the measure for same-store sales. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, our total commercial OEM revenues were down about 4% versus prior Q1.","Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the vast majority of our commercial OEM revenue, were slightly down versus prior-year Q1. Bookings for this segment, and by bookings, I mean, incoming orders, increased modestly for Q1 versus prior year and outpaced fiscal year 2017 Q1 sales.","Booking fluctuations in the commercial OEM market are most likely timing-related and have been recently impacted by the publicized wide-body rate reductions at Airbus and Boeing, and any related inventory management in the supply chain. At this point in the year, we remain comfortable with the assumptions that led us to low-to-mid single-digit commercial OEM revenue growth.","Business jet revenues make up about 15% of our commercial revenues. In total, revenues in this market continued their downward trend in Q1 fiscal year 2017, coming in well below prior year Q1. Given the performance of this market recently, this result was not unexpected. Bookings for Q1 fiscal year 2017 exceeded same quarter sales. However, any optimism for this sector is tempered by business jet OEM forecast.","For the quarter, total commercial OEM bookings were flat versus prior-year Q1 and nicely exceeded shipping levels in the current quarter. As we have said, inventory management by our OEM customers and rate reductions on some platforms have created some headwind in the commercial OEM market, but we believe this is all timing-related and will return in future quarters as our shipset content has not changed.","Total commercial aftermarket revenue was up approximately 3.5% for this quarter versus prior year Q1. Commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up 5%, but this was tempered by business jet aftermarket revenues, which were down a bit. On commercial aftermarket bookings, commercial transport aftermarket bookings grew at slightly more than 12% and outpaced current quarter sales by 12% as well. This was broadly based across most of our operating units.","Business jet aftermarket bookings were up modestly versus prior year Q1, but flat with current quarter sales. On the freighter market, the business appears to have stabilized and bookings are trending in the right direction. For our fiscal year-to-date and notwithstanding any inventory reductions in the supply chain or bookings timing, we remain comfortable with our assumptions for the commercial aftermarket segment of growth in the mid to high single digits.","Now, let me speak about our defense market, which remains relatively unchanged at about 30% of our total revenue. Defense revenues for fiscal year 2016 Q1, which include both OEM and aftermarket revenues were up slightly versus the prior year Q1. The story for Q1 is of strong defense aftermarket revenue growth combined, tempered by defense OEM declines due to program timing.","Additional fiscal year 2017 Q1 defense bookings were weak coming in well below prior year Q1 due to the timing of large defense orders in our Airborne Systems North America group. As you know, this business delivers parachutes to the U.S. military and other global customers. These orders are historically very lumpy. If you adjust for this, our defense bookings were modestly up year-over-year. We remain comfortable with our market assumptions that led us to a flat to slightly up revenue growth forecast for the total defense segment in fiscal year 2017.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q1 were refinancing cost, non-cash compensation expense, and acquisition related costs and amortizations. Our EBITDA As Defined of about $385 million for Q1 was up 21% versus prior Q1. The EBITDA As Defined margin was 47.3% of revenues for Q1, EBITDA margin excluding the dilution from the impact of acquisitions purchased in 2016 was over 48% or up approximately 2.5 margin points versus the prior period indicating our base businesses continue to find opportunities to drive improvements within our value drivers, and our recent acquisitions are coming up the curve quickly.","Finally, I thought I would provide a little color on one of our key value drivers for TransDigm, that a profitable new business growth. Frequently we update on key awards by business unit, but I thought I would provide a little more color on our engineering investment across TransDigm.","As a combined entity, TransDigm invests only 7% of our operating costs on engineering. For this purpose, we are defining operating costs as a total revenue minus EBITDA. We are evaluating as a percent of cost, as we believe comparisons to revenue may be misleading due to differences in profitability.","This investment level has been relatively consistent over time and compares favorably to others in our industry. This engineering investment drives our product development and cost reduction initiatives, and has allowed the following shipset growth on same-store comparative basis to ensure that the design awards rewards not acquisitions are driving this improvement.","For the Boeing 787 platform, our shipset content now has grown significantly when compared with previous platforms. So the Boeing 777X, Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320neo platforms, we are up modestly over prior platforms, as the OEMs desire to minimize design changes to the platform.","For the Airbus A350, TransDigm has nearly doubled its shipset content when compared to prior platforms. A400M has more than doubled shipset content when compared to competitive military freighters. And finally, the JSF program has also seen shipset growth over prior platforms. Let me conclude by stating, all in all, Q1 of fiscal year 2017 was a good start to our year.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to expand on a few items included in our quarterly financial results, and then provide some color regarding the impact from potential tax policy changes. First quarter net sales were $814 million, up $112 million or approximately 16% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions of Breeze-Eastern, DDC, and Young & Franklin\/Tactair contributed $88 million of additional sales for the period.","Our first quarter gross profit was $444 million, an increase of 19%. Our reported gross profit margin of 54.6% was 1.2 margin points higher than the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related non-operating expenses, our gross profit margins versus Q1 last year improved approximate 2.5 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure and favorable product mix.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.5% of sales for the current quarter, compared to 11.7% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock compensation, SG&A was about 11.2% of sales, compared to 9.9% of sales a year ago. The higher SG&A was primarily related to higher selling and admin costs related to recent acquisitions. We had an interest \u2013 an increase in interest expense of approximately $34 million, up 30% versus prior-year quarter. This is a result of an increase of 31% in the weighted average total debt to about $11 billion in the current quarter versus $8.4 billion in the prior year.","The higher average debt year-over-year was due to borrowing an incremental $1.9 billion in June 2016, and $1.2 billion in November to primarily fund acquisitions, pay off our 2021 bonds and pay the special dividend. Also during the quarter, we entered into a new $500 million interest rate swap, fixed at 1.9%, and a new $400 million interest rate cap at a cap rate of 2.5%.","Including all interest rate swaps and caps, approximately 75% of our debt is fixed or capped. We are currently assuming average LIBOR of 1% for the current year, which then yields at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5%. If LIBOR were to increase to 4%, our weighted average interest rate would increase 1% to 6%. This would increase our after-tax interest expense by approximately $75 million.","We now expect our full-year fiscal 2017 net interest expense to be approximately $588 million. Refinancing expense in the quarter was $32 million from the financing completed in November.","Now, moving on to taxes. In Q4 of fiscal 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for share-based payments, including stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments.","As a result, our GAAP tax rate will now generally approximate our cash tax rate during an entire fiscal year. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 14.4% in the current quarter, compared to 21.1% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the first quarter was primarily due to excess benefits from the dividend equivalent payments. We now estimate our full-year GAAP tax rate to be around 28%.","Excluding the accounting standard change, our effective tax rate is still estimated to be around 31%. To remind you, this is the rate we use in calculating our full-year adjusted EPS.","Our net income for the quarter decreased $11 million or 8% to $119 million, which is 14.6% of sales. This compares to net income of $129 million or 18.4% of net sales in the prior year. The decrease in net income primarily reflects the refinancing costs and higher interest expense, partially offset by the increase in net sales and lower effective tax rate. GAAP EPS was $0.41 per share in the current quarter, compared to $2.23 per share last year. The current quarter was significantly impacted by the $96 million of dividend equivalent payments or $1.70 per share paid in the quarter, primarily due to the $24 per share dividend. This compares to $0.05 per share paid in the prior period.","Just as a reminder, the accounting retreatment requires this payment to be deducted from the actual net income before earnings per share is calculated. Our adjusted EPS was $2.57 per share, an increase of 13% compared to $2.27 per share last year.","Please refer to table 3 in this morning's press release which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity, we generated $226 million of cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with $972 million of cash on the balance sheet. As Nick mentioned, in January, we spent approximately $150 million to repurchase 667,000 shares. As a result, we now expect our full-year weighted average shares to decrease to approximately 56.1 million shares. Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activities, we now expect our cash balance at September 30, 2017, to be between $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion.","The decrease from the last quarter's estimate is primarily due to the share repurchases, timing of interest and principal payments, and the escrow release on purchase price \u2013 of the purchase price associated with the Breeze-Eastern dissident shareholders.","We also expect that roughly $600 million in undrawn \u2013 revolver and additional capacity under our credit agreement. The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter-end was 6.2 times our pro forma EBITDA as defined, and the gross leverage was 6.8 times our pro forma EBITDA. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2017, will be approximately 5.6 times assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions.","With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP EPS to be $9.29, and as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $12.16. Increase in the adjusted EPS of $0.18 is primarily due to the increase in EBITDA as defined. The higher interest expense was offset by the decrease in weighted average shares outstanding.","Please see slide 10 for the bridge detailing \u2013 the $2.87 (31:07) of adjustments between GAAP to adjusted EPS related to this guidance.","In summary, Q1 was a good start for fiscal 2017. Finally, I would like to spend a few minutes to expand on Nick's comments earlier related to the future income tax changes under the House plan.","Again, to reiterate, we do not know what the ultimate outcome is going to be, but we wanted to give some perspective based upon our actual 2016 fiscal year as a reference point.","First, the statutory tax rate is expected to decrease from 35% to 20%. I think most people understand the potential impact of the interest on our debt not being tax-deductible. However, we suspect many people do not understand the impact of the border adjustment. As you may know based upon our disclosure included in our most recent 10-K, we have over $1.1 billion of sales to foreign customers, a good portion of these sales are associated with our U.S.-based businesses.","Based on our understanding of the House plan, the foreign sales from our domestic subsidiaries will not be subject to the U.S. income taxes. Based on the size of our foreign sales, you can see that the benefit will more than offset the loss benefit to our interest deduction.","In summary, we believe that the House plan as it's currently proposed, could be beneficial to the overall U.S. tax position of the company.","Now, I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Terry. First, I would like to ask everyone to please limit your questions to two and then reinsert yourself into the queue, so that everyone will have a chance and opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, all.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Nick, just wondered, I mean, we've gone through, now, several quarters on the weaker business jet, helicopter segment there. I just wondered if you could give us some color. Are you seeing any de-stock there associated with the kind of next leg down in rates? And when do you think, if we don't see another reduction in rates 2018 versus 2017, that that portion of the business reaches a bottom, sequentially speaking?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","The truth of the matter is, Carter, I don't know. The good news is it's not a very big part of our business. I look at all the \u2013 everything in the press, and I look at everybody. I look at the earnings releases and the statements by the business jet manufacturers. It's hard to get a lot of confidence in that.","We think, at least last year, it was down fairly substantially, and it's starting off this year down some. There is obviously some inventory draw going on there, but I am reticent to forecast when that ends. I have to admit we have been singularly unsuccessful in calling a turn in this for the last three or four years.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Were you down sequentially...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not confident...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...Q1 versus Q4?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't remember the answer to that. We have the numbers here. Was Q1 down versus Q4?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, in the OEM?","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Business jet...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah (34:57). Yeah, it is.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You'll always \u2013 frequently, you'll be down \u2013 you got the day issue between four and one, so you'll always be down some.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Absolutely. And on the days, you said 3%. That's two work days, correct?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Is it two?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, two days.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Two.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Just under two days, yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, it's like 2 on 61 or something; 2 on 61 and 2 on 63.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. It's both \u2013 yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And the weight is up \u2013 if you weight it by operating unit, you'd get about the same number.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, I know you said it's tough to size, but presumably, you catch up that 3% in one of these other quarters in the remainder of the year...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","At some point, yeah. Yeah. But Carter, I don't know what the exact quarter-per-quarter count is in each quarter going forward.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But as I said, it's hard to exactly pin that to what it exactly did in the quarter. But I would say it is more likely to impact the commercial aftermarket where the turns are faster, plus frankly, you have some buffer in distribution.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Thanks. I'll let somebody else ask.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, and good morning, guys.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Nick, just a quick question for you; it's something we have been asked. If you look at some of the more recent acquisitions, it seems like you've had a bigger skew towards defense acquisitions as opposed to commercial acquisitions. Is there a trend there, or is it just happened how they popped up? I mean, how do you think about the difference between making a defense acquisition versus a commercial acquisition?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. We haven't made any conscious decision to move more aggressively into the defense world. That's just what we saw. We go through the same process. We go through \u2013 we forecast. We try to see what we can do with the margins. We assume the capital structure just like a PE kind of buy. I would describe it \u2013 it's just the way we (37:03) over that period.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's not a conscious attempt to change the defense content.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then, one more \u2013 one last question, if I may. In the last month of the year, we saw air traffic surge. Are you seeing those kind of trends continue into the beginning of this year? Was that sort of just an end of the year make-up, or are we seeing a real pickup in air traffic?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I can't really talk about things in our business that went past the quarter, but I would say, as Kevin and I \u2013 Kevin pointed out numerically and I talked about it directionally, the bookings \u2013 the commercial aftermarket bookings are up substantially, both sequentially they ran above the shipments and up year-over-year; and, I suspect that's reflective of some of that.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, Robert.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So, Nick on \u2013 just following up a little bit on aftermarket. I wanted to peel the onion a little bit and maybe get a sense of your guidance bridge from really \u2013 from this first quarter plus 3.5% to the mid to high single digits for the year. So, let's throw out a couple things. You've said that the commercial transport was stronger in the quarter than the average at about plus 5%. Business jet, obviously, is still week, holding that back. Fewer shipping days in the quarter, so it seems like we should add about 3% to all these numbers. But doesn't the second quarter have a tough comp and also fewer shipping days with leap year last year? And so, does this mean that all of the real strength is in the second half of the year Q3 and Q4? How do we think about the cadence on aftermarket growth as we go through the year?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I would say that the quarterly days for the balance of the year comp the other, I just \u2013 I'm sure if you counted them, Rob, that's probably right. I just don't know the answer to that. I'd say, the main thing that gives me comfort, one, it's not unusual to start off a little slow in the first quarter. But I mostly take comfort from that the bookings are so strong. The bookings are up very substantially, and that's what gives me the best comfort.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","But don't those only give you about a one quarter look? What you \u2013 in other words, what you saw in the December quarter...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, something like that...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","... is going to give you a sense for the March quarter?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I don't know that that's an exact cutoff. But that's \u2013 I think, three or four months is probably a reasonable number. So, if your question is, do I know what's going to ship in the fourth quarter? I do not. I don't \u2013 we don't have the backlog, yet. But if I look at the metrics we see, which is air travel, which is we don't see distributor inventories out of whack \u2013 that's not to say there couldn't still be some at airlines; we don't see it at distributors. And we see the incoming bookings in coming quite strong; that gives us the comfort. Obviously, we don't know, yet.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then, just as my follow-up, what's the latest on the M&A side? How does the pipeline look? How, if at all...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Pipeline is decent. Pipeline is decent. I mean, I think pretty good. It is \u2013 it \u2013 as usual, it \u2013 usually, it's small and midsize stuff. We'd always like bigger things, within reason. We don't want them too big, because we don't want to place all our chips on one bet. But I would say it's reasonably active, Rob; reasonably active if I look at it versus other time frames.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","And from a number of properties out there versus pricing, again, has that changed at all?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think the pricing has changed, at least \u2013 the next thing that closes, of course, I don't know what the price will be. But I don't see any indication that the pricing has changed.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's \u2013 good proprietary sole source stuff with a decent amount of aftermarket is pricing.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks, Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Nick, last year, I think you had a 350-basis-point headwind in your aftermarket from business jet, helicopter and freighter versus air transport. And I think in the quarter, you said it's about 150-basis-point headwind, what's baked into the full year in that mid to high single-digit growth? Does the headwind dissipate through the course of the year, is this, kind of 150 basis points, going to be with us for the duration?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We did not forecast any significant growth in that in our base forecast. I don't remember whether it was a little lower or not. But it wasn't a significant \u2013 it wasn't significantly up or significantly down. I just don't remember whether it was zero or minus 1, or something like that. We weren't figuring on anything here in the business jet world.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. I'm just kind of curious, the underlying growth last year in air transport was 9.5%, just curious what your assumption is for underlying air transport in the aftermarket for this fiscal year is. Did you have that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think we told you, right \u2013 oh, I see, you're trying to pull them out, right?","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You're trying to pull them out. Yeah, yeah.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, you could probably look at it \u2013 I'd probably figure, commercial transport's probably 85% of the volume.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And figure there, business jet is maybe zero, 1, maybe down 1 or 2 on the low side, up 1 or 2 on the high side, somewhere around zero, when you kind of back into it.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, the other question I got asked recently a fair amount was, maybe your sales in the military channel, how much is on commercial terms versus straight-up military terms, do you happen to know that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the exact number there, and one of the reasons I don't know the exact number is it's sometimes a little informal rather than \u2013 the bigger the order gets, the more informal that gets. And the smaller ones are a little more informal, but I would guess, I would guess, if you took all of our sales to the military \u2013 to the U.S. military, direct them to the brokers, I think you're probably in the 20% to 30% range, could be a little plus or minus on that.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Nick, just as a follow-up to that last question there, are your margins different when selling through a distributor versus direct in a sort of all-else-equal or like-for-like sale?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I know \u2013 the answer is I don't exactly know that answer, Noah, but I do not believe there's any substantial difference. I mean, we essentially sell for the same price usually, in the vast majority of the cases.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, I...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","(44:46).","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Makes sense. In the commentary about bookings being substantially ahead of revenue in the aftermarket, can you quantify that, like how fast did bookings grow year-over-year, or how much further ahead of revenue were the bookings?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","The \u2013 I'm not \u2013 the answer, as I said here is that I don't know that. Let me take a look. I'm going to look now at our magic cheat sheet here. And can you \u2013 can you give that number, Kevin? Yeah.","(45:21)","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","12%.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","12%.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, about 12%.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So \u2013 sorry, bookings grew 12%.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","In other words, if you \u2013 if you ship the $100, we book $112.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thereabout.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Okay, great. And then, just one last one. Obviously \u2013 or seemingly, if you were to lose interest expense deductibility on new debt, that would come \u2013 that would be an offset to a lower corporate rate. But if I just ask you hypothetically, if you just lost interest expense deductibility on new debt and that was the only change to your tax policy, would that change how you run the business?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. No. I don't \u2013 no, if you hypothesize that interest rates went up to 20%, I might answer that differently. But anything \u2013 any realistic range or rates that I see, I do not \u2013 I don't see that changing anything we do. I don't see anything that we've seen talked about here that would change our fundamental business or capital market strategy.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And is that just because for every dollar of additional debt you take on, the accretion from deploying that towards an acquisition is a much larger number...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right. That's right.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...than the loss of \u2013 okay. Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right. And \u2013 or conversely \u2013 or another way, not conversely, but another way of putting that is if we used it to buy stock or pay out dividends, I would look at it as the cost of our equity is 15% to 20%. And that's after tax, and there's almost no interest rate I can think of that would make that a bad swap.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","I was just wondering, can we follow up on the M&A question just because it's been asked a lot, you'll have about $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of cash at the end of the year, how are you thinking about that, deploying that a little bit more shorter term? And then, over the long term, is there any way you could quantify or talk about your addressable market, and how you think about attractive deals out there?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, on the \u2013 what do we do if we have $1.5 billion or $1.4 billion at the end of the year, I really don't want to speculate on that. I mean that's a long way off, we'll do what we always do, we'll look at our borrowing capacity, and we'll look at the backlog at deals, and we'll look at the credit market and the equity market, and we'll decide what to do with it. I mean, basically our choices are, right, hold it for some future acquisitions that we haven't seen yet, maybe, or start to pay back out to the shareholders. I mean that's pretty much what we always do. And as I sit here today, I just \u2013 I don't have to speculate on where we go, other than I think you can \u2013 I think you know pretty well how we think about this, and I don't see any change in our \u2013 in the way we look at it. And what was your other question?","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Just on the longer term, addressable market, has the size of deals changed or the number of deals being offered changed?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think so. I mean, as you know, this is a big market. There's lots of companies out there. The problem, it's not identifying companies we like, it's finding ones that are willing to sell, and that's just a continual sort of churning and then beating the bushes effort.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then, if I could ask one more on the pro forma revenue growth versus the organic growth for the quarter, could you maybe recap how that works and just the delta between the two of them, and with the commercial OE being down 4%, aside from business jets, were there specific platforms that are driving the softness and where do you expect to pick up?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I'm going to \u2013 I'm going to pass to Terry on the pro forma versus the GAAP growth because I'm not sure I'd understand that if I use same-store.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","(49:35) the way I always look at it.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. What we do from a pro form standpoint is we look at the businesses, assuming that we've owned them for 12 months. So, we'll go back on acquisitions and look at their sales in the past, and add that in, and the growth of that \u2013 our pro forma growth was 3.5%. The GAAP number, I'm not sure, if you have that yet, that was GAAP...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That was GAAP.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","GAAP...","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","GAAP was 3.5%, yeah. We haven't given pro forma on that number, but it's pretty close to the same.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, simplistically, the GAAP number only reflects the portion of the year that you own the business. The pro forma number assumes we own the business as the whole year.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Right. So the underlying business was essentially a little bit better. I was just wondering what the drag was, if there was one, but maybe the difference is irrelevant?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the answer.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just a commercial OE pick-up throughout the year?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You mean, what is the growth?","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. What's starting pick up?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. It's a reflection of our shipset content. I mean, ROE forecast is pretty simple. I mean, we know our shipset content. We know the production rates for 2017. There's a little bit of an estimate because you don't know what's \u2013 if there's a cut in 2018, it could start to ripple back in to 2017 and you have little bit of guess where there is going to any inventory movement. But I mean, our shipset content hasn't changed. The production rates, we think, we were conservative going into the year, we still think we're conservative. So that's our logic.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question come from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey.","David E.

Can you compare how that looks commercial versus defense, what the overall competitive environment looks like in commercial relative to defense?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","David, I don't think it's materially different. I'd use roughly the same percent.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess the question I always get, why do you think your view on why you don't generate more in the way of competition given the returns that obviously you guys put up over time, I guess both on the commercial side and the defense side?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, if you're not already in this business, it's just tough to get in. As you know, it's a pretty long gestation period to get into this. And product per product, they're pretty small market segments. So I think you know developed from scratch, it's relatively almost very small risk. I mean the other is, do you mean in the M&A world?","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, exactly.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. In the M&A world these \u2013 they tend to be smaller businesses. So one by one they get, where I'd mostly think of is PE, they tend to be small so that they're not as exciting for the other bigger PE firms or even the mid-size ones when they first come up. Frankly, it's tough to compete against us. If you're a PE firm that is looking in a proprietary aerospace business and you're outbidding us, you got to be pretty worried, right, because the only way you're going to do that is to be making a higher bet on the margin improvement. And the other thing is a couple have started it and frankly, we bought them. Odyssey started a roll up and we bought it. McKechnie, JLL started a roll up and we bought it with McKechnie.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then a follow-up, the bookings rate that you saw in the aftermarket side, any way, Nick, you can slice and dice that, discretionary, non-discretionary, how much might be a boost from initial sparing on the A350 or MAX or?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think there is \u2013 as I said, I don't know the exact number on the provisioning but I do not think it's very significant. We didn't see much for the Boeing 787 and I don't believe there's much to it there. I think if you look at the details, it's a pretty broad based booking pick-up across the vast majority of our businesses.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Please go ahead, Ken.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, Nick, I just wanted to follow up. I just wanted to confirm for your military business, it's about 55% aftermarket, 45% OE, is that, oh, I'm sorry?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Something like that. Something like that.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I mean, that's the total average. I don't think the military is way off of that, I don't have the exact number here. Actually, excuse me, it's a little higher. It's more like 60%, 30% or 65%, 35%. Close to that.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah. Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, everybody is waving their hands at me.","Unknown Speaker","55%","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay. So still 55% like I thought. When I said 55%, Ken, the whole place started to waving their arms.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","So about two-thirds, about two-thirds, one-third, then aftermarket versus OEM?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. No. No. No. Rough 55%, 45% just like the overall business.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then on the \u2013 I appreciate the comments that Terry or color on sort of your shipset content changes on some of the programs. Can you just provide any color on for these increases, I'm assuming obviously, the organic and factoring acquisitions, but how much of these any color on the price versus volume shift or how do you think about sort of your additional content on particular programs? And maybe, a little bit behind what's helping you win some of that in the marketplace?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","First, just I'm not sure I got the question right. But just the numbers Kevin gave they were like-like same-store.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","They were organic growth. It's not \u2013 the 787 content didn't go up because we bought the content. We compared it before and after with the same mix of businesses, so if you follow.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So it's like-like same-store. Why does it go up? Because I think we do a good job. I think we service the account. We're all over the engineering department. I think we are reliable deliverers, the stuff works and we chase it pretty aggressively.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. I mean, I guess...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sort of the same reason you sell anything. I think the \u2013 you're asking me how much is pricing, how much is units, I think?","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Well, that's not much to \u2013 sorry, not so much units, maybe the share gain, obviously, share gain versus price?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the answer to that. I can tell you it's not a whole lot of price because it's tough to get price at the OEM. I mean, it's some, but it's not a whole lot. So presumptively, that means there's some share gains, but I have to admit I don't know what the number is.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, thank you. Nick, I saw in the proxy filed last month that your board extended the deadline for naming Kevin CEO from I think December 2017 to December 2019 along with a few other changes to his comp metrics. Can you talk about what drove that change, and maybe the timing of it? Thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, yeah, nothing changed with my contracts, as you may or may not know. My contract presently runs through 2019, and my contract presently anticipates that, at some point, I could become an Executive Chairman. I think we changed it because Kevin became President and CEO here, as you know, and I think it more likely fits with our current thinking, though it mostly just gives us more optionality.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Good. And then, in terms of the bookings, is there anything \u2013 you said you're obviously bullish about the outlook for the year based on the strong bookings, and I get that, but is there anything that you're seeing in terms of the nature of the bookings that are changing? Like, are you seeing airlines buying things maybe like a little bit further in advance, maybe in fear of like limited parts availability or just better demand trends overall, if they're seeing that at all? Anything that gives you even more ...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think so. I can't ...","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","No?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","There's nothing that I could really point out that I have any confidence in in that. And I just want to be sure, I'm not \u2013 we're saying, we feel comfortable now with our forecast, our guidance for the year, which is the same as we started the year off with. So, we're not suggesting it looks far more bullish, just the strong bookings give us additional confidence.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Okay. And then, one point of clarification. That 12% bookings over revenue, that's on a year-over-year change basis, right?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","On a what?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","When you said bookings were 12% ahead of sales, that was on a year-over-year change basis, right?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. That's correct.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you very much.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we're mixing questions.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, we're mixing questions.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're mixing questions. If you compare the bookings....","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, let me say it in case I got them mixed up. If you look at the bookings this quarter against the bookings last quarter, in the commercial transport and aftermarket, they're up about 12%. Just coincidently, coincidently, if you look at the bookings this quarter against the shipments this quarter, they also are up somewhere around 12%. So, it's to say coincidently around the same number, which may be a little confusing.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure. So, what are bookings up year-over-year, then, if that makes...?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","12%.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Oh. I thought you just said sequentially. All right, that's fine. 12%, got it. We'll follow up later if I need to. Thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","...getting me on here. Nick, can you just talk about \u2013 pricing is obviously one of the value drivers. Have you guys seen any change in the marketplace in regards to your pricing? Obviously, we've got some OEM involvement. The airlines are always looking, I guess, to get a better price. And then, just in addition to that, is there any difference in your pricing policy when you're selling a product exclusively through a distributor or direct to a customer?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Let's see. Let me answer that in a couple of ways. I could say, in total \u2013 that's not to say it couldn't be account by account, but when you roll the thing up in total, the pricing dynamics and the pricing numbers have not changed substantively for a number of years. It's still roughly we get the same answer. Maybe one unit this year is a little better than another one, but they all tend to put and take and weight up to about the same number, which is one we track very closely.","The other question was the distributor versus direct?","Michael F. Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","In the military, we sell to the distributors and brokers where they get the same price. There is no difference there. In the commercial, I'm not sure of the answer to that. I think it's pretty \u2013 I don't think there's a material difference.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then, just a last one, still some conservatism on the OE side. Have you guys made any changes, or do you plan on, to head count for your overhead?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think, as you know, we sort of preemptively adjusted the head count about a year ago. I think we may have moved it down a little this quarter, but not by \u2013 Kevin, is that right? I think it was down a little.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But not on across the board, just units adjusted as it looked to them like they were a little softer or not a little softer. I think, right now \u2013 and this is mostly around the commercial transport cycle and when it might start to soften up, I think, right now, we think we've made about what adjustments we think are appropriate, but we'll keep watching it.","Our concern is, how long does the commercial transport OEM cycle hold up. When does it start to soften? And when it does, how does that reflect back into this year? So far, we see no indication and we think, frankly, the numbers we used, which we think are still conservative.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, good afternoon.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hi, and welcome, welcome.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. I appreciate it. So, following up on a prior question about margin improvement on deals, how much of that comes from price changes and what are the other key levers for profit improvement besides price when you're integrating a business?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I mean, it's essentially \u2013 it's not consistent across deals. I mean, it's essentially, we get the margin improvement essentially three ways: some price adjustment; some cost adjustment; and, hopefully, if we bought in to something that's growing, we get a little bit of operating leverage by the business growing. If not, the other way we can get it is by looking at the product lines and seeing if we want the profitable ones and the unprofitable ones. But the vast majority of it typically comes from natural market growth, price adjustment and cost adjustment.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay, great. And then, so you bought back a bunch of stock at $225. Should we assume that was just one-time opportunistic or what are the expectations here now that you're after the quarter out of a blackout period?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, we'll decide that \u2013 the capital allocation is something we'll decide based on how things look when it comes time to make that decision. I'd say the buy through the quarter, frankly, we would have bought more, but we were stuck with the 10b5 plan that, essentially, you have to put it on automatic pilot. And it was on automatic pilot when we made the buys and at what amount we could buy. If we had it to reset, we frankly would have put more \u2013 we would have set more in it.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay. All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for your time. Nick, just a quick question, and thanks for all the color on the military side. Just in general, with your guidance flat to slightly up this year, and you have \u2013 again, I think you mentioned 55% tied to aftermarket, any thoughts on the sensitivity around if readiness spending really ramps up and how that impacts your business?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Oh, yeah, ramp-up in readiness spending is good. At this point, I'd be very cautious about predicting any significant change in this year. They got to get the budget. They got to place the orders, then it takes a while to ship it. It's always hard to guess when the military starts to buy, but I'm being reticent. In the near term, which I'd define as this year, I'd be cautious about assuming any significant change just because of the inertia and time lag.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. But over the longer term, you obviously would see something?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I would think so, readiness is a \u2013 typically readiness means buy more repair parts, buy more services, buy more repairs, all that sort of thing, which is generally good for us.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Terrific. Thanks for all the color. Thanks.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes, thanks. Good morning or afternoon, I guess. A couple of questions. Nick, you've remarked about the Brazilian portfolio and it has been. I just wonder, do you see any increasing risk of maybe non-economic motivated actors kind of coming in and trying to second source? And specifically, I think of folks like Boeing or the DoD where maybe an immediate profit motive isn't a desire to kind of second source more. Obviously, you have not been hit by PMA parts in a big way, so it's not economics that would drive disruption.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I can't \u2013 I mean, obviously, I can't \u2013 I don't know what somebody might do in the fullness of time. I can say it's a long effort if it was to happen and we haven't seen it. And at least typically with the OEMs, in our contracting basis that looks similar to what it has been in the past generally. But I mean, I just \u2013 I don't know what someone might do. We have not seen it. I don't think the math works. I think, it's unlikely but I can't be certain on that. But I'll say again, I don't see it and I haven't seen any significant sign of it.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on that. We understand your strategy post acquisition, some of the spot sales get re-priced higher and the like and the contracts as they roll off. How much remaining pricing power is there in years two, three, four post an acquisition? I mean, I just wonder like have you \u2013 do you still have more price inelasticity that you could exercise as this actually became a threat so that in year two and three, you just don't have kind of modest inflation type pricing adjustments but rather more significant ones? Do you have unexploited pricing power within the portfolio still?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I can't answer that generically. I mean, that's very fact and circumstance specific. When I think if you particularly as we get bigger, this gets \u2013 when you roll everything up, overall prices are pretty consistent \u2013 are consistently above inflation, not miles above or the bottom.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Terry maybe, if you could give \u2013 thanks for the information about the tax law changes, do you guys have significant sourcing that comes from outside of the U.S. or is there any light that you can shed on that?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's quite difficult. We're decentralized. We have 33 business units. Where they get their source from, it's difficult to estimate it at this point in time. We haven't got gotten that level of detail, but we're just taking this at a very high level, we don't want to spend a ton of time analyzing something that certainly is going to be debated for a long period of time, as they put the new law, if they haven't changed the tax law in place. So, we haven't gotten at that level of inputs, but the exports are pretty significant to us.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I think, Terry, it's safe to say that when you did the calculation, you assume the reasonable deduct for that?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. Absolutely.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","All right. So, if you take the $1.1 billion, and what's the interest, it is about $580 million? Interest is about $580 million ...","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Last year it was under $500 million, but this year it was ...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, it's $580 million. If you take the $1.1 billion, and I'd also say depending on how they treat distributors, that could be higher. You can deduct the fair amount from that and still be at above $580 million.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's correct.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, as a follow-up, do you guys expect at some point for F-35 to become one of your top 15 programs and if so roughly when?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's a good platform. Top 15? I don't want to answer that because I don't \u2013 I haven't done the math. I don't know the answer, but it's a good platform. I would expect that someday, it would start to show up on our top 15 or 25, but I don't know when and haven't done the math on it.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for the time. Just a simple question for you, really the organic revenues. If you look over the last couple of years, what's been the breakdown between volume and price?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we don't disclose the price. Look, we just don't disclose our price.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just directionally, like are we seeing volumes down?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We just don't disclose the price. As I told you, the prices \u2013 the weighted up prices are higher than inflation. We will think of inflation is 3%, but it's not miles higher.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Helpful. And then another just relatively quick question for you. As we look forward and to the extent that aircraft retirement start to pick up or even go down, how does that impact your business, if at all? Is that a risk? Is that an opportunity?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, you ought to think of us as we're \u2013 when you look at our aftermarket, the commercial aftermarket, which I presume, which you're mostly talking about, you can pretty well think of us as market weighted. So, different people have different definitions with legacy aircraft and what the retirement rates are, but you can almost think of us like the market. That's about how we're weighted. So, if you think 727s are going run off of at a certain rate, that's how we'll run off.","Now, remember, we're interjecting new airplanes into the mix every year or two. So as that runs off, something else moves into that old window, as long as the shipset keeps going. But that's the best way to calibrate it, figure were about market weighted.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very, helpful. Thank you, sir.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter K.

My name is Erica, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Liza Sabol","Good morning, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2014 second quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Ray Laubenthal; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus.","The company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC, available through the investor section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures.","Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, please let me now turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley","Good morning. Thanks, everybody, for calling in again this morning to hear about our company. Sorry for the couple of minutes delay. We are technology challenged and our Internet's down here. So that means no hard questions, by the way.","Anyway, today I'll start off with the comments about our consistent strategy, update on the commercial aftermarket, an overview of the financial performance and a market summary for what this quarter looks like and an update on our full year guidance.","To restate, as I say each quarter, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. Why we believe this? About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, and around 3\/4 of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Excluding the small non-aviation business, over 1\/2 of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and provided relative stability in -- throughout the cycles. Based on our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditure requirements, TransDigm has year in and year out generated strong free cash flow.","We have a well-proven, value-based operating strategy, focused around what we refer to as our 3 value drivers: New business development, continual cost improvement and value-based pricing. We also maintain a decentralized organization structure with operating unit executives who think, act and are paid like owners. We stick to these concepts as the core of our operating management methods. This consistent approach has worked for us through up and down markets, while allowing us to steadily invest in new businesses and new platform positions.","We have also been successful in regularly acquiring integrating businesses. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have been able to acquire and improved such businesses through all phases in the cycle. We pay close attention to our capital structure and capital allocation. We view this as another means to create shareholder value.","As you know, we have in the past and continue to be willing to lever up when we either see good opportunities or view our leverage as suboptimal for value creation. We typically begin to delever pretty quickly.","As this year proceeds, we continue to look at our likely needs for acquisition, internal investment and cash and\/or debt capacity, as well as the capital market situations, all in context of our near-term outlook or needs.","The current credit market situation, by almost any historical standard, is favorable. From a longer-term perspective the after-tax cost and the terms for debt capital are intriguing, especially when compared to our stated equity return goals. In light of these conditions, we are, as usual, evaluating the capital market conditions and how best to maximize our equity return in this market.","At the end of our second quarter, after closing the Airborne and EME acquisition, and based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $2 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity. This capacity continues to grow. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated levels for fiscal year 2014.","Overall, through our consistent focus on our operating value drivers, a very clear acquisition strategy and close attention to our capital structure and allocation, we have been able to create intrinsic value for our shareholders for many years through up and down markets, and we anticipate continuing to do so in the future.","With respect to the commercial aftermarket status, as we reported in the past, we began to see signs of a modest recovery at the end of last year. This has continued and grown in the first half of fiscal year 2014. The second quarter of fiscal year 2014, commercial aftermarket revenues on a same-store basis were up about 8% versus the prior year Q2, and are now up about 7.5% for the first half of this year versus the first half of last year.","Our bookings or incoming orders are up about 20% on a Q2 versus prior year Q2 basis and 17% on a year-to-date versus our prior year-to-date basis. We also saw meaningful increases in sales and bookings in a number of our more discretionary products.","This aftermarket recovery may not be linear, that is, there may be quarterly ups and downs, many forecasters believe, and our data seems to indicate even more strongly now that the commercial aftermarket is now expanding. If the worldwide economy holds up, we would expect this to continue.","Turning to our Q2 2014 performance. I'll remind you, this is the second quarter for fiscal year 2014. Our year began October 1. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons could be significantly impacted by differences in OEM and aftermarket mix, large orders, trends in inventory fluctuations, modest seasonality and other factors. I also want to point out, the EME acquisition had no impact on the income statement in Q2.","The second quarter of fiscal year '14 was generally a good quarter for TransDigm. GAAP revenues were up 27% versus the prior year Q2 and 25% on a year-to-date basis. Bookings continue to run ahead of revenues. Reviewing the revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q2 and year, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.","In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 11% versus prior Q2 and about the same on a year-to-date basis. This is primarily driven by the commercial transport OEM revenues, which are up 14% year-to-date. The business jet revenues were up much less at 6% on a year-to-date basis.","The total aftermarket revenue comps, as I said before, so I won't repeat, were up about 8% versus prior Q2. Our individual operating units continue to be a little spotty, but most operating units are up.","The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenue. Total defense revenues are up about 1% versus the prior second quarter and about the same 1% on a year-to-date basis. These numbers now include our Airborne business and their revenues in all periods.","The Airborne revenues and bookings tend to be more lumpy than our base business. Without Airborne, our underlying defense revenues were up 3% versus the prior year Q2 and 8% on a year-to-date basis.","Year-to-date total defense bookings are just about equal to shipments in spite of delays in certain large parachute orders. We did receive the first $8 million release on one of the large delayed GPS-driven cargo parachute project, in early April. This was about $8 million. It's the first release on a large program, but it was too late to book for this quarter. We remain cautious about trends in Military.","Moving on to profitability and on a reported basis, I am just going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q2 were primarily due to acquisition-related costs and noncash stock option expenses. Our EBITDA As Defined of about $263 million for Q2 was up 20% versus the prior year and year-to-date, the $507 million is up about 21% versus the prior year-to-date.","The EBITDA margin As Defined was about 45% of revenue on a year-to-date basis and roughly the same for Q2. The Q2 margin was reduced almost 2% by the inclusion of Airborne. There seem to be some confusion over this dilution in Q2. Our base business EBITDA margin, excluding Airborne and the 3 2013 acquisitions is running at about 48% on a year-to-date basis. This is up about 1% versus the prior year-to-date.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue actively looking. The pipeline of possibilities is reasonably active, about the same mix of sizes, as usual, closings are always difficult to predict and as you know, we don't comment on anything. We remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Moving on now to our updated guidance for 2014, and I believe this is on Slide 6. The military spending is still unclear. The rate of recovery in the commercial aftermarket seems to be proceeding nicely and the underlying EBITDA margins are running slightly ahead. We are reflecting the recent EME acquisition in this revision. This is our best current estimate. As usual, we will let you know if our views change one way or another.","Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions in 2014, the guidance is revised as follows. The midpoint of the revised revenue guidance is now $2.34 billion or up about $29 million versus the prior guidance. The revenue increase is primarily due to the EME acquisition, with some modest operations pickup.","The midpoint of the revised 2014 EBITDA guidance is $1.06 billion or 45% of revenue, up $7 million from our prior guidance. This margin includes 1.5% of dilution from Airborne and EME. The dilution, as I mentioned, began to show in Q2 for Airborne, and both Airborne and EME for the balance of the year.","The dollar increase in EBITDA is from both the EME acquisition for 6 months and some improvement in the base business EBITDA outlook. We are anticipating our base businesses, excluding Airborne, EME and the 2013 acquisitions, to again run at about 48% EBITDA margin.","The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $7.58 a share versus the prior guidance of $7.50. The range on this is plus or minus $0.12 a share in either direction. This change is primarily due to the increase in the EBITDA I described above.","At this time, our 2014 guidance is still roughly based on the market growth assumptions we gave with our original guidance. We feel a bit more positive about the commercial aftermarket now than we probably did at the beginning of the year and a bit less so about the defense markets. We'll look at this again next quarter.","In summary, the first half is about order expectations. Hopefully, the strengthening market conditions continue. But in any event, I'm confident that with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors.","And now, I'm going to pass this on to Ray, who will talk a little bit about some recent acquisitions and new business.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thanks, Nick. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good second quarter and finished up a busy first half. The consistent application of our operating value drivers and the successful integration of our recent acquisitions continue to add solid value to TransDigm. Let me explain in a little more detail our second quarter operational value creation.","In late December, we acquired Airborne Systems Inc. Bob Henderson, one of our Executive Vice Presidents, is working the integration and transition of this business. To date, the transition is well underway and progressing as planned.","Bob split this business into 2 separate operating units, one based in North America and one based in the U.K. The North American unit is the larger of the two, and we've moved 2 experienced TransDigm executives into this unit. Bryce Wiedeman is the new President of Airborne North America, and Kevin McHenry is their new Director of Sales and Marketing. Their new assignments will greatly expedite the integration transition and accelerate value-creation efforts.","60 days ago, we acquired Elektro-Metall Export or EME for short. Pete Palmer, one of our Executive Vice Presidents, is taking this German actuator business through the early stages of our acquisition integration process. Both Airborne and EME are applying our proven value-creation processes by restructuring the business in the product line focus groups and implementing our value-creation metrics. They're focusing the engineering and new business efforts on winnable and profitable new business, and they're tightening up the cost structure.","Now I'd like to switch gears and talk about our existing businesses. We continue to invest in new business solutions for our broad-based customers. Our operating units have successfully expanded our platform content with significant new business in both the commercial and military markets.","In the commercial market segments, we have developed many new applications. Here are some recent examples. On the A350, we continue to win new business applications in addition to those I mentioned on prior calls. Recently, Hartwell has been awarded additional exterior door decompression panel hatches; Adams Rite is developing the secured cockpit door module, along with the interior luggage bin latches; AmSafe Nets has been awarded the A350 cargo net; Champion recently developed and was awarded the ignition system for the Rolls Royce train engine; and Dukes is providing the temperature and vibration sensory memory module on the A350 APU.","In addition to prior content on the A320neo, MarathonNorco was awarded the hold open rods for the engine fan cowl. Aero Fluid Products is developing the lubrication system oil control manifold and the trim check valves.","On the new Airbus X4 helicopter, MarathonNorco was awarded the nickel-cadmium main battery. AeroControlex was awarded the air data pitot tubes. And Aero Fluid Products is developing the hydraulic system pressure-reducing valves.","On the new Bell 525 Relentless helicopter, Aero Fluid Products is supplying the loop pump valves and oil system check valves. Adams Rite Aerospace is supplying the door bolting system for the crew door, the passenger door, the baggage door and the nose compartment access doors. And Dukes is supplying the engines' bleed air valves.","And on -- lastly, on the Embraer E2 aircraft, Arkwin was awarded the flight control hydraulic system reservoir, and our AvtechTyee unit was awarded the PA communication system.","We're also quite active providing the airlines with cabin interior OEM and aftermarket upgrades. Schneller continues to provide decorative engineered laminates for the OEM and aftermarket first class and business class seating applications and most recently for American Airlines, Qantas, China Eastern, Air France, Japan Airlines and several others.","And AmSafe restraints is now providing their reduced-weight seatbelts to American Airlines, Japan Airlines, Aegean Airlines. Other airlines such as Air France, Virgin Atlantic and American are also specifying AmSafe's airbag enhanced seatbelts for some of their premium seating configurations.","Adams Rite Bruce lighting product line has won contracts to provide energy-saving LED cabin lighting to various airlines such as Air Canada, Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas, Air Astana, Neos Air and Germania.","And in the military market segments, we've also been active developing new products and application. AmSafe Nets has won a large multi-year order to supply the French government with their new QuickDrop cargo release actuation system, which allows military helicopters to automatically quickly release underslung cargo loads remotely from the cockpit, and this reduces ground crew risk and it speeds military operation tempo.","Airborne secured a large order from the U.S. Army for their advanced RA1 ram-air parachutes, and they also secured orders from Israel and India for their new T11 personnel parachutes. Avionic Instruments was awarded the AC\/DC power distribution system on the new Sikorsky S-97 RAIDER helicopter. They're also awarded the main auxiliary power regulator transformer rectifier unit on the CH-53 helicopter. Arkwin also, on the CH-53, was awarded the ramp door actuator. And Aero Fluid Products has developed and was awarded the upgraded oil cooler actuator on the C-130. A lot of product applications.","These new engineered solutions and many others not discussed continue to expand our profitable product offerings and add to our future growth. Now let me hand it over to Greg who will review our financial results in more detail.","Gregory Rufus","Thanks, Ray. Please reference Slide 7 of this morning's press release. I'd like to expand on a few items included in our quarterly financial results. Sales were $591 million and 27% greater than the prior year. Our organic sales were 6% higher than last year, driven by growth in commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket.","Second quarter gross profit was $308 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year. The reported gross profit margin of 52.1% was 3.6 margin points less than the prior year. This quarter's margins were negatively impacted by the current year acquisition of Airborne and the acquisitions of Arkwin, Whippany and Aerosonic in the prior year.","The dilutive impact from acquisition mix and acquisition-related costs was approximately 4.5 margin points at the gross profit line. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins and the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved approximately 1 margin point. The base business is continuing to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure.","Selling and administrative expenses were 12.1% of sales for the current quarter, compared to 11.9% in the prior year. Excluding stock comp expense and acquisition-related expense, SG&A was 10.5% of sales in both periods. This quarter was sequentially higher than quarter 1, primarily due to additional acquisition-related costs and noncash comp expense. We expect SG&A to average approximately 11.5% in the second half of our fiscal year.","Interest expense was $82 million, an increase of approximately $18 million versus the prior year quarter. This was a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $5.7 billion in the current quarter versus $4.3 billion in the prior year.","The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the amount borrowed to distribute $1.8 billion of special dividends last year. Our weighted average interest rate is 5.4%, compared to 5.5% in the prior year. One-time refinancing costs of $30 million were booked in the prior period in conjunction with the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility in February of last year.","Our effective tax rate was 33.7% in the current quarter, compared to 31.9% in the prior year. Last year's rate was primarily reduced by the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit at that time. We still expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be around 34% and our cash taxes to be about $175 million.","Our net income for the quarter increased $22 million or 33% to $90 million, which is 15% of sales. This compares to net income of $68 million in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the absence of the refinancing charges booked in the prior period and the growth in net sales, partially offset by higher interest expense and acquisition-related costs.","As I discussed in the past, our EPS was calculated under the 2-class method versus the more commonly used treasury method. We are required to use this method because of our dividend equivalent program.","As you can see on Tables 1 and 3 of this morning's press release, our GAAP EPS was $1.49 per share in the current quarter, compared to $1.25 per share last year. The current quarter was impacted by dividend equivalent payments of $5 million or $0.10 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $1.87 per share, an increase of 8%, compared to $1.74 per share last year.","The 8% increase is lower than the 12% increase in adjusted net income due to the higher weighted average shares in the current period, resulting from the accelerated stock option vesting that occurred primarily in 2013. Again, please reference Table 3 of this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP to adjusted EPS.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity. After the purchase of EME, we ended the quarter with $476 million of cash on the balance sheet. The company's net debt leverage ratio was 5.1x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined. We now expect to end the year with approximately $700 million of cash on the balance sheet, assuming no other acquisition activity. Absent any changes to our capital structure, we expect our net debt leverage ratio to be approximately 4.7x EBITDA As Defined at the end of the year.","Now let me hand over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to talk about the bookings and aftermarket and the strong level you've seen here in the first half, outpacing the growth in sales, and why you might not expect that sales increase to rise into the teams given the bookings. I heard you say it's not linear, but maybe you could flesh that out a little bit more for us.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. We've got -- one, we have some step-up in the second half, and the percents aren't always exactly comparable. When we go through -- let me just look at the quarterly numbers there.","Gregory Rufus","I just want to see what the -- I want to quickly look at where the quarters are.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, there's a step-up in the second half of last year, Rob, so the percents aren't exactly comparable, if you follow me, when you compare them to the subsequent quarters. But as I said, we shipped roughly 8% in the first half of the year. We have to be getting up somewhere in the -- right, 12% or so in the second half of the year, and we think there could be some upside there, Rob. I mean, I don't know how to tell you. We told you we think there should -- could be some upside there, and we're a little concerned about the defense world.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I was going to ask you on the defense. And this is my other question, Nick. Have we not seen -- just based on your numbers and the trajectory here, is that [ph] wave of aftermarket maintenance that we thought would come out of the budget resolution, is that just very shaky at this point?","W. Nicholas Howley","I can't say, Rob. I cannot say we have seen any substantive amount of that.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And is it just that the guys in Washington aren't getting to the orders? I mean, do you -- can you tell what it is?","W. Nicholas Howley","I really don't know the answer, Rob, other than it's not -- there's not a big rush of stuff as I -- that's what I know. I can't -- and I can't say its specific to one program or one operating unit either.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So there are no pockets of weakness that you can identify?","W. Nicholas Howley","The only one it is, as I think I mentioned, the parachute, some of the big parachute orders are -- have been delayed. Now that's a mix, that's all around the world. The one significant one from the U.S. that we've been sort of hanging fire on got delayed. It got awarded right after the -- right at the beginning of the next quarter, but it doesn't show up in the numbers. But we've seen some delays for the parachute upgrades in some other foreign countries too. That's the only place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Just to clarify, Nick, with respect to Airborne and the performance there, was that slide out of the DoD order really the only differential relative to your expectations? I caught a little comment you made about the inclusion of Airborne causing some confusion on the margin front. I wondered if you might just elaborate there, how the business performed in total relative to what you were expecting.","W. Nicholas Howley","The margin is -- I think, I know the style [ph] of different comments about the earnings, about the softness of the margin. The margin is what we expected. We expected the margin to step down as we included it. It was not included in the -- so that wasn't a surprise at all and the volume wasn't particularly a surprise. What's a little, frankly, slower than we might have hoped is the rate of bookings, and there were -- there's 2 or 3 big orders, a couple outside the U.S. and one inside the U.S. The one inside the U.S. is subsequently dropped, but we -- I know as we've guided. With the others, the others have not. They're still stretched out some. The other thing we see in that is that's a lumpier business than some of our other businesses, and pushing some of the foreign orders through the hoop is a longer slide than we might have hoped.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And then just as a follow-up, I know you said no hard questions, so I'll try to keep it as easy as possible. I...","W. Nicholas Howley","Because our Internet's not working, and we actually don't know any answers on our own.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Without Google, I know you're struggling. So this is the time of year where you guys usually begin to gear up for your sort of annual planning cycle, and I know last year that, that affected -- it's seen in your capital deployment decision and the leverage decision and the dividend payout. I wondered if you might kind of step through not only how debt markets and the openness that you referenced are influencing that planning, as well as the end market conditions that, I recall the last couple of years you guys have been pretty conservative or cautious about headcount additions and whatnot. How is that planning cycle shaping up this year with these conditions relative to what we've seen in the past couple?","W. Nicholas Howley","I don't think -- Greg, let me state this and you correct me if I'm wrong. We are not slamming down on the hiring or the headcount. We are -- by and large, view this, at least at this point, with the exception of the defense business, which isn't that big a part of our business, as -- that we are still -- we are in an expanding market now. I don't know how much more the OEM has, but I don't think it has -- I don't think it's near the top. I think the aftermarket is expanding. As long as the economy keeps coming along, that will come along okay. So I mean, we are -- I would like to say we're fairly balanced on where we are with adding headcount. When it's needed, we're adding it. We're not trying to -- we're not as -- I would say, we're not being as rigid as we were probably a year ago or 6 or 9 months ago, right? Is that a fair assessment?","Gregory Rufus","Yes. And the OEM backlogs are pretty long, so you can see them turn up from far away and you can see them turn down from far away. So right now, our backlogs for next year are filling in like they have every year and...","W. Nicholas Howley","Maybe even a little better.","Gregory Rufus","Yes, so we don't -- we're going to...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And with respect to the credit market conditions and all that entails in terms of capital deployment, M&A competitiveness. How does that shape up?","W. Nicholas Howley","I think as usual, Carter, our first choice of use of capital is going to be support our existing business and to buy accretive acquisitions that meet our criteria. I can say the stuff on the horizon in general in size isn't much different than we typically see, and the credit markets are very, very positive. I mean, we are -- as we do every year, we're going through the process of trying to decide what makes sense for capital allocation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss at UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, on the EBITDA margin side, you highlighted Airborne, 200 basis point margin hit. As we think about EBITDA margins -- adjusted EBITDA margins, through the rest of the year, your midpoint is roughly -- the midpoint of your guidance is roughly in line with what you've done in the first half. If we think about getting to the high end of your adjusted EBITDA range, what's the biggest driver of that, Nick or Greg? Is it improvement in Airborne underlying margins, is it the aftermarket coming through? Just kind of what gets us to the high end of that EBITDA margin range?","W. Nicholas Howley","On the margin or the dollars?","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the -- well, however you want to comment. I mean, I'm thinking more on the margin side, but however you want to go after it.","Gregory Rufus","I'm just looking at the numbers here. There's nothing much different, is it?","Liza Sabol","Yes, but...","Gregory Rufus","[indiscernible]","Gregory Rufus","I think the margins are pretty close in the range.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, I think -- if I look at your -- the midpoint of your adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, it's around 45.2%, which is in line with what you've done year-to-date, thinking from the high end [ph].","W. Nicholas Howley","David, I'm just looking at the numbers.","Gregory Rufus","Hopefully, that's the same guidance.","W. Nicholas Howley","There's a couple of things happening, obviously. Airborne did a lower margin. With EME, I'll start [indiscernible]","Gregory Rufus","Just [ph] casually. The range of the -- we have the same margin at the high end of the range for sales and the low end of it. [indiscernible] because [ph] that's why it was disconnected, David. I was disconnected. I mean, what moves the dollars, essentially the revenue. Now the practical matter, what will move that -- the actual, what will move the margin is [indiscernible] aftermarket [ph] shifts. We're light on -- if we're right on the commercial aftermarket assumption, the margin will probably move a little bit.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, okay. And then Nick, just thoughts on leverage. I know you -- in the past, you've been comfortable going up to kind of 6x. You're at 5x now. Is 6x kind of the right way to think about the high end of where you're willing to go to or...","W. Nicholas Howley","What did they do last year for the dividend?","Gregory Rufus","We went up just a little over 6 net.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, we're up to 6, net. What was the gross last year?","Gregory Rufus","About 6.5.","W. Nicholas Howley","About 6.5. I wouldn't want to -- I don't want to speculate on that. The -- I would say typically, it's been 3.5 to 6.5 kind of numbers, but the credit markets are pretty attractive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Nick, you started to talk about the M&A pipeline a little bit. I wonder if you could just maybe provide a little bit more color in terms of how many good opportunities you see, what valuations are like. And I'm kind of curious, actually, also more broadly, if you have any thoughts on why it seems like activity is picking up broadly in the space. Is it just more executive confidence in the system? Are people worried about the cycle? Nothing specific, just broadly curious if you have any thoughts on that.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. I don't know -- I understand we had this announcement from B\/E yesterday, but I don't -- or the day before or whatever it was. I don't -- I would say, no, in general, I can't say that the level of activity has changed a whole lot that we've seen. We see sort of a reasonable flow of small to midsized stuff generally. I would say prices, they're not getting any better, but they're -- I can't say they're -- of the stuff that's transacted that we know of, it hasn't -- I don't think the prices have moved a lot. I will say to get out of the aerospace business and the typical just industrial sort of PE world, those prices have gotten pretty tough with the -- and we're not in that, but we're just watching them from outside. As the capital markets loosen up more and more and more, that essentially moves up the PE by prices.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so it doesn't sound like...","W. Nicholas Howley","I can't say we've seen -- I mean, the prices are always higher than we want, but I can't say they're markedly higher than they were a year ago.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like on both your opportunity set and your pricing, nothing is substantially different today than 6 months ago.","W. Nicholas Howley","No, no. You're going to pay proprietary commercial stuff with a good aftermarket. You're going to pay a hefty multiple for defense stuff, you're going to pay less.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the amount of it that's available out there for you?","W. Nicholas Howley","I don't think it's disproportionate. I mean, I can't -- for a while, we were seeing a lot of defense stuff. I can't say we're seeing that now.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I also had a question on the margins. I wondered if you could parse out what drives the variance between the 47.5, 48 that you'd be at right now without the dilution from your most recent acquisitions, and the 49 to 50 with a handful of quarters over 50 that you were doing 2 or 3 years ago? What's -- now that you can look back at your actuals and things that have layered in, what's driving that differential?","Gregory Rufus","Well, the vast majority is acquisition mix.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, there's other acquisitions other than the ones we're excluding just on a year-to-year basis.","Gregory Rufus","Right, we [indiscernible]","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you can talk specific businesses and better diluting it.","Gregory Rufus","Well, yes, when we acquired AmSafe, we mixed [ph] out. In AmSafe, we had some good businesses, but we had some ones that we should -- look at our margins, AmSafe was a pretty big deal. And so that was one that [indiscernible] substantially, and depending what timeframe they're in.","W. Nicholas Howley","I don't want to start speculating on them and then add up the wrong [ph] details.","Gregory Rufus","But I'm very comfortable saying the EBITDA margins in the 50% ranges, that -- those core businesses are performing very well and the lower margins we're reporting now is entirely due to acquisition mix.","W. Nicholas Howley","We don't have -- there's no -- I don't want to say -- without thinking, I can't say there's no business at all with the margins down. But in general, there's no degradation of margins. Margins in the businesses we have continue to creep slowly up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So first, just to follow-up on the last series of questions. It appears that the valuation for EME was actually quite attractive, at least on a price-to-sales basis. It looks to be at about 1.2. Was just in the line with what you just said about valuations still being somewhat high for commercially levered companies. What enabled you to get such a good deal? Is there something about the margin profile of that business that allowed you to get it at a bit of a discount?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, the -- it's a little bit complicated for the size of it, which probably scared some people off. There's a little bit of concentration issue in Airbus. There was some in there, just -- there was some small part of it that's automotive that you have to be done that may have scared people off. And I think basically, it didn't get shot very wide. Those are the reasons I speculate, but the fact is we bought it for a pretty good multiple. I mean, good for us.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And in terms of the EBITDA margin, can you give us maybe a general sense of where it is now and where you expect it to go?","W. Nicholas Howley","No. We don't disclose that. We don't -- we're not -- we don't disclose EBITDA margin on any individual business.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Long term, is this consistent with the typical targets you have for your acquisitions?","W. Nicholas Howley","Probably not quite as high. We think the value creation opportunity is very good because it's starting low. We'll have to see over time. It's got some contractual LPAs that we're going to have to see how we can work that out. But I mean, it's plenty, plenty of value creation, easily meets our PE kind of return of up over 20%, easily meets that.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just one more, not to belabor EME, but you mentioned it had no contribution in the quarter, I think it closed about 3.5 weeks before the end of the quarter. Why did it not contribute?","Gregory Rufus","Their accounting systems aren't that sophisticated. It's rather small. So for the next several foreseeable months, they'll be at a one month of delay in closing.","W. Nicholas Howley","Which is another way of saying they couldn't get the numbers in time.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","As long as you got the cash, it's okay.","W. Nicholas Howley","We got the cash.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Nick, I noticed your biz jet OEM was up 6% in the quarter. Maybe give us some idea of what some of the drivers might be for that, because we're generally hearing the biz jet is pretty flat at the moment.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. I mean, it's the same as everybody sees. The small stuff -- the smaller stuff isn't doing so well, and the bigger jets are doing a little better, and that's essentially all we're seeing. And I think we may have a little bit just with the timing when the shipments were. I don't -- this doesn't -- I wouldn't change our fundamental view on the business jet market. I think the best days are still in front of it.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned last quarter -- well, you didn't really mention, about the Boeing partnering [ph] agreement. You couldn't really say anything about it. I was just wondering if everything has continued to track to your expectations on that new agreement.","W. Nicholas Howley","I still have the same issue I had before. We have a confidentiality agreement, and we sort of have -- we have an agreement on what we'll say, and that's what I've said.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a quick one. A lot of companies around the U.S. have comments about weather in the first quarter. Is that part of the impact on your business?","W. Nicholas Howley","Not substantively. I don't -- if it is, we didn't notice it. I don't -- I can't say there's any substantive impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about -- with EME, I think that was the first foreign domicile acquisition you've done. Can you just talk about that opportunity set? Should we expect to see more in terms of M&A abroad?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, we are -- interestingly enough, we didn't -- we now have 1, 2, 3, 4 standalone businesses in Europe. We have 2 in U.K., and we have one in Belgium and now one in Germany. We are -- now the others came with something else, but they were standalone operating units and we got pretty comfortable with them. I would say we are seeing more activity. What the rate of closure will be, I just don't know. I believe it's a pretty fragmented space, but we have to see one where we see the PE kind of returns on it. But I can say we're seeing more.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Seeing more that actually fit the filter, is that the criteria?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes. And some of that maybe -- we may just be digging harder, too. We had a pretty good guy retained over there that's pretty active.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just to follow-up on that, within what you're seeing, are any of these deals sizable, are they more of the EME size?","W. Nicholas Howley","I would say more in the typical size we see, the more -- more like that, $30 million to $100 million kind of thing. I mean, that's not to say we couldn't tomorrow morning see another -- a bigger one, but that's -- so far, that's sort of what we've been seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Canaccord.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the earlier commentary on the commercial aftermarket. Nick, have you seen any change in the last 1 to 2 quarters in airlines, comfort with their inventory levels? I mean, are we seeing any restocking. And is that maybe at all contributing to -- obviously, you see that ultimately on the sales side, but maybe the -- sort of the impact on bookings relative to -- the better number in bookings relative to sales?","W. Nicholas Howley","Possibly. I would say, in the -- and for restocking, for the revenues, I don't think so. In other words, if you take the sales and take out whatever price might be in there, I don't think they're running ahead of the RPM or however you want to look at it, consumption rate. So I don't see any signs of that frothing up yet. But I take your question, the bookings might indicate some of that. But when we lay out the shipments for ourselves, at least so far, we don't see it. But if the bookings continue to froth up for a couple of quarters, I would say we're going to start seeing it.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes, okay. And when do you -- I mean, what's -- historically, what's been the lag? I mean, is -- because I know obviously, your commentary and you're sounding a little more optimistic about the commercial aftermarket with your -- with the almost 10% better bookings number relative to sales number. Is that something that you, all things considered, you expect to see this year or is some of that maybe going to spill into fiscal '15?","Gregory Rufus","It starts kicking in, in the second half [indiscernible]","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. I mean, it starts kicking in, in the second half, the numbers are going up. But if we continue to book at this rate, probably we would ship more in the second half.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes, okay. Now, I mean, I guess, that question was it's not -- it's not all in the next quarter or 2. I mean, there's -- some of it could spill into '15. It's just hard to predict the timing on all of this, I would guess.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes, yes. But surely, increasing shipments and increasing order rate, you have to believe, is a good sign.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes, no, certainly. It's very positive. I'm just trying to get at how much we see -- obviously, this year -- to some of the earlier commentary, this fiscal year versus how much is this maybe even more of a positive implication for '15. And it's positive for both, obviously.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. I think it's too early for us to speculate on '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Nick, I think you mentioned, on the last call, you had about $1.5 billion of capacity for equity, and I think you mentioned this morning about $2 billion. You did a deal, small admittedly, in the quarter. But I mean, that seems like a pretty good growth in capacity sequentially. And I'm curious, is that credit environment relaxation? Is it just trailing EBITDA growth? Is it your look at the balance sheet?","W. Nicholas Howley","I mean, it's all of the above. The EBITDA is growing, the LTM grows a little bit, that gives us more capacity. Every quarter, we pile up a couple of hundred million or so more cash, and the credit market is a little better now. But at least -- it weren't better, it's been very good, but it's even a little better now. But I think we most -- I don't think, I know. We've been calculating that number under our current credit agreement. So we're not reflecting an improved credit market yet in that.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then you kind of commented in the context of EME about complexity of deals and kind of your willingness as a buyer [ph] differentiation. You have been more willing to swallow a pill and then regurgitate pieces of it you don't necessarily like. I'm curious, what's the size of the complexity you're willing to entertain when those deals are involved? I mean, McKechnie is I think the biggest that I could point to where you clearly had a large chunk of that, that you would look at as noncore and positioned it as such. I mean, are there big deals that you're looking at where that complexity makes you the preferred bidder right now?","W. Nicholas Howley","You wouldn't be asking me about B\/E Aerospace, would you, just by chance?","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You can answer however you'd like, Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley","Right. The answer is, I saw that one come out the last few days, just like everybody did. At least today, I don't know of any other big one [ph] that's in the middle or that's hanging fire [ph] anywhere. And I don't know where we are on that B\/E business. Prior, we -- I would say, in the past, with the oil well businesses and the distribution businesses, we had little, if any, interest at all. As they break it up -- if it's going to break up, I don't know, we may or may not be interested in some of the parts. I don't know enough about it yet to speculate.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then the last one, so maybe I had the numbers wrong, but Airborne, I thought, was about -- running about $40 million revenue a quarter. And so if it was -- if Airborne was a 3.5 point drag to EBITDA margins as adjusted, it kind of looked like it was kind of netting no contribution to EBITDA in the quarter. Was it running really light or were the margins, on an adjusted basis, out of Airborne really low in this quarter and then pop back up?","W. Nicholas Howley","Greg, can you...","Liza Sabol","[indiscernible] Airborne is almost 2.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, Airborne was just a little [indiscernible]","Gregory Rufus","It was 2, not 3.5, right?","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","To the quarter?","Raymond F. Laubenthal","To the quarter. Yes, to the quarter.","Gregory Rufus","On the operating side, that's excluding -- when I get my numbers, I put in my purchase price [indiscernible]","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, but everything I told him was [indiscernible]","Gregory Rufus","Everything [indiscernible] as adjusted.","W. Nicholas Howley","Airborne was about 2, and then pertaining [ph] to the margins [indiscernible] that we have. So I don't -- maybe it's 2 or 3.5 that's fouling you up.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So EBITDA As Defined would have been 46.5% in the quarter without Airborne?","Gregory Rufus","Yes, pretty close, yes. It's close to 44.5% [indiscernible]","W. Nicholas Howley","Exactly, right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Keybanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Nick, just to stay on that one line of questioning, you've obviously expanded your overseas footprint. Do you guys foresee any ability to reduce your tax rate or take advantage of any potential favorable tax treatment with that building base of business there?","Gregory Rufus","There is some, but it's not a material amount because this is a small acquisition. What was nice though was half the acquisition was paid with cash that was overseas, so that was a nice [indiscernible] good deal, but the deal is not big enough just to make a material difference in our tax rate.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then Nick, I think you called out, you're seeing meaningful increases in discretionary related products. That would seemingly imply, I guess, airlines getting a lot more comfortable spending a lot more. I mean, can you give us a sense of -- in terms of maybe your overall revenue mix? Are you more weighted or seeing your percent of discretionary increase versus, I guess, flight [ph] critical type revenues?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, first, the discretionary component in our aftermarket is relatively low. It's well, well under half. We've given out numbers at different times in the past, but it's way below half. So I guess obviously, if one grows a little faster than the other, the percent goes up a little bit. But it's not a particularly meaningful part of our aftermarket. More in the -- what numbers have we given out? I don't want to start -- okay, so I don't want to throw a number. But it's way, way less than half the volume.","Gregory Rufus","I don't think the percent's moved materially just because it's a small number.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. Last one, just on the kind of margins loosening [ph]. It seems like you guys have a significant amount of new product development efforts underway. Is elevated R&D creating any additional drag versus historic periods, or are you seeing more stringent pricing on some of these new programs that you're competing for, where maybe you're not capturing as much on the lower margin to OE side of the business with some of these new products or entry into service on new platforms?","W. Nicholas Howley","No, we...","Our R&D is well behaved. There's nothing [ph] really unusual with our fleet, and that's not moving around a lot. I mean, we also -- as we've said before, we tend to look at total engineering expense, which is divided between sort of above the gross profit line of growth and that tends to stay reasonably steady. And as a percent of revenues, sometimes, the accounts move around a little bit, but it stays reasonably steady. As far as the new platforms, the ones that -- all the ones coming out, our content is -- we've been -- and I think we've been through this a couple of times, our content is moving up reasonably well on all of the them.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Versus the predecessor.","W. Nicholas Howley","Versus the predecessor, so I can't...","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","How about the operating income or the margins? Are your margins changing at all on those, that new...","W. Nicholas Howley","I can't speak to platform by platform, but I would say, in the total context of the project, in other words we look at the upfront money, the OEM ramp-up, the aftermarket, the economics aren't changing substantively.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Nick, I wanted to ask a bit of a broader question on leverage. Now for years, you guys have demonstrated very strong operations, great M&A track record. You've done well for your creditors, you've done well for your equity holders. At what point do we revisit the historical leverage ranges that we've seen TransDigm operate at? And it certainly sounds like the market would give that to you.","W. Nicholas Howley","You -- I presume you mean higher, not lower?","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","W. Nicholas Howley","No. It -- I mean, I don't want to speculate on that. We have to -- we'll -- that will be a very fact and circumstance specific thing. I think generally, our target range is in the range we generally discuss. That's not to say as we've said in the past when we saw a particularly attractive credit situation or acquisition opportunity, we might not jump up above that, but we delever pretty quick.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. On defense, you mentioned a little bit more sort of risk to the outlook there. I think we all sort of expected to hear maybe more sluggish kind of risky commentary around defense, but what can you say just to get us comfortable that there isn't any kind of cliff that you're worried about?","W. Nicholas Howley","I guess, the only thing I could say is we don't think there's any kind of cliff we're worried about in the next 6 months. I don't know what to say about the next 18 months. We could -- we think we have given you a set of guidance numbers that we think are quite achievable. As I told you, if I sort of jumped ahead, 9 months and then looked back, it wouldn't surprise me if the commercial aftermarket was a little better and the defense might be a little worse. But I hope they're right on our expectation.","Operator","In next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Seth Seifman on for Joe this morning. Just following up on defense. You mentioned some of the lumpiness and timing issues with the parachute orders at Airborne. When those orders come in, do they typically convert into sales very quickly?","Gregory Rufus","No. They take -- Airborne has a longer lead time for [indiscernible]","W. Nicholas Howley","[indiscernible] but the -- and those big orders, they book out. And then typically, those orders span multi-year periods as we're finding, and so you'll give big order, they start to ship out maybe at the earliest in 6 months, but usually longer than that because the customer doesn't want it all up front and they don't want to pay all up front. They spread it over 3 or 4 years typically.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And so that order that came through at the beginning of, I guess, of your Q3, it fits that profile?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, similarly.","Gregory Rufus","But not [indiscernible]","W. Nicholas Howley","Of the $8 million we got, that's like going to be [indiscernible] But it's the first order on a big -- much bigger order that will stagger over [indiscernible]. Yes, and then I think I had mentioned some other foreign orders that came in and those are multi-year orders also.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on one last quick one about capital deployment. Nick, you've talked in the past about potentially one day sort of opening the aperture beyond the level of proprietary and sole-source content that you look for in acquisitions. As you figure it today, how do you think about potentially opening that aperture versus say, paying another dividend?","W. Nicholas Howley","I would say -- you mean, open the aperture for proprietary content or out of the aerospace industry or something like that?","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I guess more so probably the proprietary content, that seems like that's where your...","W. Nicholas Howley","We have little if any interest at all in stepping out the aerospace industry. I would say approaching none, unless we get there by mistake or something. I would say, as we sit here now, we're not -- we don't know that we feel the need to get very far outside of our proprietary envelope definition. That's not a hard black and white line. It has to be a lot of proprietary content, whether a lot means 92 or 81 or 75, I'm not so sure, but we don't feel any need to substantively change.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question which comes from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just on Slide 7, you have your forecast for the percentage contribution from commercial aftermarket and defense. It seems that, that's changed a bit from last quarter. I think defense contribution goes up, commercial aftermarket goes down. Is that just related to recategorizing where Airborne fall?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. Yes, Airborne wasn't in it last time.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over.","Liza Sabol","Thank you for calling in for our call this morning, and we plan to file our 10-Q sometime tomorrow.","W.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Allison, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2013 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Ray Laubenthal; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next 2 weeks. Replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com. It should be also noted that our Form 10-Q will be filed tomorrow and also can be found on our website.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements.

Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Good morning, and thanks again, everyone, for calling in to hear about our company. Today, I'll start off with some comments, as usual, about our consistent strategy. And then I'd like to talk a little about the status of the commercial aftermarket, our operating margins and then go into a review of the second quarter and an update on the 2013 outlook.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, and this is on Page 4 of the slides, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products, around 3\/4 of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Excluding the small ground transportation business, about 50% of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA as defined comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability in the cycles. Because of our uniquely high underlying EBITDA margins, somewhere around 50% of revenues and relatively low capital expenditures, typically less than 2% of revenues, TransDigm has year in and year out generated strong free cash flow.","We pay close attention to our capital structure and capital allocation and view this as another means to create shareholder value. In keeping with that philosophy, due to a combination of suboptimum capital structure, a hot credit market and significant liquidity, we declared and paid a $12.85 per share special dividend in Q1 and still maintained significant borrowing capacity post-dividend.","In Q2, we refinanced about $2.2 billion of senior secured debt. The goal and the net result was to reduce interest expense and to increase our flexibility under the credit agreement. As of 3\/30\/13, we have about $680 million of cash, $300 million in unrestricted and undrawn revolver and additional capacity under our new credit agreement. With no additional acquisitions or capital market activity, cash should be over $900 million at the end of our fiscal year, and net leverage a little under 4x pro forma EBITDA as defined. As usual, we will address our use of cash, borrowing capacity and capital allocation issues as the year proceeds to make a determination as to how best to proceed based on the factors that exist at that time.","We have a well-proven, value-based operating strategy focused around what we refer to as our 3 value drivers: new business development, continual cost improvement and value-based pricing. This consistent approach has allowed us to continuously increase the intrinsic value of our businesses while steadily investing in new business and platform positions.","We have also been successful in regularly acquiring and integrating businesses. We acquire proprietary aerospace products with significant aftermarket content. We have been able to acquire and improve such businesses through all phases of the cycle. Through our consistent focus on our operating value drivers, a clear acquisition strategy and close attention to our capital structure, we have been able to create intrinsic value for our shareholders for many years through up and down markets. In uncertain times like this, we focus on these fundamental elements of value creation as the things we can control.","In April, we announced an agreement to acquire Aerosonic for about $39 million. This is a small public company. So we have to get through the various steps that entails. The revenue is roughly $30 million. Hopefully, this closes in the next 45 to 90 days. Aerosonic serves the commercial and military aerospace markets. The products are highly proprietary with about 55% of the revenues from commercial markets and 65% -- 60% of the revenue from the aftermarket. This is similar to the Aero-Instruments business we bought in September. Since we don't own the business and it's a small public company, we can't say much more at this time.","I'd like to address 2 other issues: one, our thoughts on the commercial aftermarket; and two, some clarification of the EBITDA as defined margins. With respect to the commercial aftermarket, through Q2, we still have not seen clear signs of a sustained pickup. We, as many in the industry, are a bit surprised by how long this soft market has continued, especially in light of the decent underlying market trends. We are still hopeful of a pickup in the second half of the year, but suspect it may be more like the second half of the calendar year than the second half of our fiscal year.","As the commercial aftermarket softness beginning last -- began last summer, we hired SH&E, a well-known aerospace consulting company, to go through a rigorous analysis on a product line by product line basis of our commercial aftermarket revenues and outlook by platform and give us a second position or opinion on our market position. They completed this work during our first quarter of fiscal year 2013. There are a few significant findings, mostly good over the mid-to-long term, but a few not so good in the short term.","Specifically, I think the following is worth sharing. On the positive side, SH&E concluded that our mix of products and platforms were strong. As a result, over a longer period, say, 3 to 5 years, TransDigm's aftermarket revenue growth should outpace annual RPM or market growth by 1 to 2 percentage points per year if you include the new 787, CSeries and Airbus platforms and also should grow modestly above RPM growth or market growth even if you just look at the base fleet. That is excluding the new platforms.","For the near future, TransDigm will likely continue to use RPM as a base planning tool until we see more actual market results. But this generally confirms our view. We feel positive about this conclusion and its longer-term implications.","SH&E also noted that industry-wide, secondhand parts usage appears to be growing. However, due to the relatively low price points and lower percentage of rotable pool-type full assemblies sold by TransDigm, SH&E concluded that TransDigm's exposure to and risk from used parts and PMA is not a significant factor. This has generally been our view, but we're glad to have it confirmed. Of course, this bears continual watching.","On the less positive note, SH&E concluded that the near term softer market and aftermarket revenues at TransDigm and possibly many other component supplier is due primarily to: One, softer European carrier demand as a result of attempts to draw down inventory and defer maintenance in response to the poor economic situation; and two, softer Asian-Pacific market carrier demand. Asian-Pacific carriers hold inventories, according to SH&E, that are quite high by North American standards, and many Asian carriers are making a concerted effort to both draw stocks down and to more carefully schedule maintenance cycles.","SH&E also tended to be a bit more pessimistic on industry-wide longer-term RPM growth, more in the 4% range than the generally used 5% range. The net result of all this is it's hard to predict the inflection point with any specificity, but it's more likely later in the calendar year than earlier, and the European recovery at least could stretch into the next year.","To remind you, TransDigm's fiscal year ends on 9\/30. So on upturns, our fiscal year trend tends to lag the calendar year trends by a bit. Time will tell how accurate all this proves to be.","Now with respect to our operating margins. We use EBITDA as defined as our best measure of operating performance. You will notice the reported EBITDA as defined margin for the first half of 2012 compared to the first half of 2013 is down, from 49% to 47%. There is a fair amount of noise in the comparable period numbers, and I'd like to try and sort this out a little. I'm going to review the first half of 2013 versus the first half of 2012. The longer the period you compare for this, at least in my judgment, the less distorted things get by cutoff issues, onetime events and the like.","The comparable numbers are muddied by 3 significant items: one, is onetime scope change settlements in the 2012 period, mostly on the 787; two, differences in the mix of businesses owned in 2013 due primarily to the acquisition of the AmSafe businesses in February 2012; and three, product mix dilution with the slower commercial aftermarket revenues in 2013. As I believe you know, this is a high-margin portion of our business.","In our view, a more consistent comparison between the 2 periods of the fundamental operating performance is generally as follows. If you look at the first half of 2012, the reported first half EBITDA as defined margin is 49% -- about 49%. If you remove the benefit of the onetime scope change settlement, you reduce the margin by about 1% to 48%. If you look at the first half of 2013, the reported first half 2013 EBITDA as defined margin is about 47%. If you add back the dilutive impact of the acquisitions, primarily AmSafe, you increase the margin by about 2.5%. If you add back the unfavorable OEM to aftermarket mix to make it consistent, you add about another 1 point. So you adjust the first half 2013 EBITDA margins on a comparable or normalized basis, we view at about 50.5%. That is a normalized increase from operations of about 2.5% or 50.5% minus 48%. This is how we look at the business operations and track the results internally.","Interesting, on the same normalized basis over the same 12-month period, the older base businesses, that is pre-McKechnie margins, are up a little -- on the business we owned before we bought McKechnie, are up a little over 1%. And the recently acquired, that is McKechnie and forward business margins, are up between 4% and 5% over the same 12-month period. Hopefully, this is helpful. But in any event, it's the pieces we use internally to track performance, and you can shuffle them around however it makes sense to you.","Moving on to our most recent quarter. I'll remind you this is the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Our fiscal year began October 1. In total, the quarter, with market channel puts and takes, was roughly in line with our expectations. As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be impacted by a whole range of onetime events. But as you know, we began to see commercial aftermarket softness in the back half of fiscal year 2012. As I just reviewed, the softness has continued into Q2 of fiscal year 2013, and the market status is still not clear.","The total company GAAP revenues were up about 10% versus prior Q2 and 16% on a 6-month comparable basis. On a same store or pro forma basis, revenues, that is if we owned the same mix of businesses, was up about 3% on a Q2 versus Q2 basis and about the same on a year-to-date basis. Again on a same store or pro forma basis, year-to-date bookings continue to run ahead of revenues. Commercial aerospace OEM and defense are -- and total defense are booking significantly ahead of revenues. Commercial aftermarket is just booking slightly ahead, and our small non-aero business is about flat.","Reviewing the revenues by market category and again on a pro forma or same-store basis versus the prior year Q2, and this is Slide 5. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up about 3\/4 of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 6% versus the prior Q2 and 5% on a year-to-date basis. This is modestly ahead of our original expectations. As a reminder, commercial OEM revenues were up 36% in the prior Q2 and 28% for the first half of 2012. So the comps are tough.","Total commercial aftermarket revenues were about flat versus prior Q2 and up 1% on a year-to-date basis. Revenues per day in both periods are up a bit. To clarify this a little, on a Q2 versus Q2 basis, the actual reported revenues are down less than 1%. However, on a revenue per day basis, they're up about 2.5%. On a year-to-date basis, the actual revenues are up about 1%, and the revenues per day basis are also up roughly 2.5%.","This to me at least -- this is somewhat unclear picture, so I'm calling that roughly flat. The booking and shipment trends continue to vary considerably across product lines. Ray is going to give you a little more color on this, but our more discretionary products continue to be particularly soft, while the other less discretionary, which make up the bulk of our revenue, appear to show more signs of stability. As I mentioned earlier, the market situation isn't clear though, given the underlying economics, we'd expect to see some pickup soon.","In the defense market, which makes up about 1\/4 of our revenues, defense revenues continue significantly better than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Revenues are up about 8% on a quarter versus quarter basis and 5% on a year-to-date basis. Again, Ray is going to add a little color here.","The military and defense bookings and results are mixed by product line, but more are up than down. Military revenues are holding up better than we anticipated, especially in the aftermarket, but we remain very cautious about trends in this market.","Our non-aero business, though small, was down about 7.5% in Q2 and year-to-date. About 70% of the non-aero business is the ground-based seatbelt business.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis. I already reviewed our operating performance on EBITDA as defined. The as defined adjustments in Q2 were made up primarily of refinancing expenses and noncash stock option expenses.","Our EBITDA as defined of about $219 million for Q2 was up 8% versus the prior year and 11% on a year-to-date basis. The EBITDA as defined margin was about 48% for Q2 and slightly lower on a year-to-date. As I discussed earlier, adjusted for acquisitions, unfavorable mix and contract settlements, based on the way we look at operations that I described previously, we think the underlying margin is up around 2.5% versus the first half of last year.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue active looking at opportunities. The pipeline is still pretty active. Closings are difficult to predict, but we remain focused and disciplined on our criteria and our value-creation method of analysis.","Moving now on to 2013. The current economic and political environment is still unclear. Hopefully, it clarifies, but in the meantime, we remain cautious with our spending levels. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions, the 2013 guidance is slightly revised as follows. I'll note that the midpoint for revenue and EBITDA is materially unchanged or EBITDA as defined. The range again has just tightened a bit.","The midpoint of the 2013 revenue guidance is very slightly up at $1.86 billion or about 9% on a GAAP basis, up about 9%. The midpoint of the 2013 EBITDA as defined guidance is unchanged at $888 million or about 48% of revenues. This implies an EBITDA as defined margin approaching 49% in the second half of the year. EBITDA dollars are up about 10% on a GAAP basis. The midpoint of the EBIT -- EPS as defined is now anticipated to be $6.94 a share. That's up $0.08 from the prior guidance. This primarily reflects the lower interest expense as a result of our refinancing.","On a pro forma or again same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions. We'll continue to assess the impact of the market uncertainty as the year proceeds. We are reducing our fiscal year '13 full year commercial aftermarket revenue growth estimates. Due to the continued industry-wide softening in the back half of 2012 fiscal year and the continuation in the first half of our 2013, we are cautious here. At this time, it appears unlikely that we will get to the low end of our 5% to 10% growth range. The second half of the fiscal year is usually a bit stronger, but we'd have to see a pickup in the back half of our fiscal year, that's April through September, of close to 10% year-over-year to get to the lower end of the range. This is possible, but seems like a stretch at this time. We'll continue to watch it closely.","Based on the strong year-to-date revenues and bookings, we now estimate that defense or military revenues to be up in the low- to mid-single digits. This is an improvement versus our prior guidance. This assumes no cancellations or significant additional delays from sequestration in the balance of our fiscal year. Commercial OEM revenue growth we now estimate to be in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage growth range. This is also an improvement.","So in summary, for fiscal year 2013, we now see commercial OEM and defense growth a little better than we originally anticipated, and commercial aftermarket a bit worse than we originally anticipated. As I said before, without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have over $900 million of cash, $300 million in undrawn revolver. And assuming no acquisitions, no additional acquisitions, our net leverage is anticipated to be a bit under 4x EBITDA at the end of the year. We also have additional capacity under our agreement.","It's still not clear to me that the market's settled out. Hopefully, the economy will start to pick up and the political situation stabilize. But in any event, I'm confident in our consistent value-focused strategy and the strong mix of our businesses. In times like this, again, we focus on the things we can control. We think that way we can continue to create long term intrinsic value.","And for that, with that, let me hand this over to Ray, our Chief Operating Officer.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thanks, Nick. As Nick mentioned, in total, our second quarter was roughly in line with our expectations. However, the lingering economic softness still has us tightly managing our cost structure. We have not implemented an across-the-board headcount reduction, but we have, adjusting for acquisitions, steadily reduced our headcount each quarter during the last 6 quarters. Our overall headcount is about 4% lower than it was at this time last year. This tight control across is particularly challenging with the stronger OEM revenues and softer aftermarket revenue mix that we're currently experiencing.","Generally, our OEM sales are at a lower margin than our aftermarket sales. Therefore, this mix of sales requires more labor wages and effort per dollar shipped that makes improving headcount with regard to revenue particularly challenging. Despite this, we believe our operations are doing a good job of managing their cost structure during the current market conditions.","As Nick said, we have been looking closely at the prolonged softness in the commercial aftermarket and the unexpected strength in the defense revenue. We have over 50 different product lines, and bookings and shipments do vary quite a bit from one product line to the other, but we have seen some trends.","In the commercial transport aftermarket, we continue to see particular softness in the sales of discretionary spares items. We estimate these product sales make up in the range of 5% to 15% of our annual commercial transport spares revenue, depending on the different customers' definition of discretionary and their unique maintenance practices or procedures. These discretionary products are typically things like cabin interior cosmetic items or discretionary product upgrade. The discretionary cabin interior spares products would include items such as the refurbishment portion of our engineered laminates business and non-textile flooring, some lavatory faucet components, luggage bin latches and a portion of our lighting components.","As I said, sales of these discretionary products continue to be weak. And as Nick said, we still expect to see our second half commercial aftermarket improve. But operationally, we'll continue to proceed cautiously until the market recovers.","In our defense business, we continue to see stronger-than-expected sales. I remind you that defense sales make up almost 1\/4 of our revenue. Here also we see bookings and shipments vary quite a bit from one product line to the other, but we have seen some trends.","For instance, military spares sales, especially foreign military spares, continue to be stronger than expected. We estimate the foreign military sales to be roughly 25% of our total defense revenue. Of particular note, our foreign spares sales of our Patriot missile products, fighter jet products and C-130 spares are strong. Additionally, both domestic and foreign military helicopter spares continue to be strong.","Our defense OEM programs are also, on balance, more up than down. Our A400M component sales are starting to ramp up as Airbus increases their production rates. On the A400M, we provide a range of products including composite fuel isolators, the main and auxillary propeller feathering pumps, the engine ignition system, the landing gear kneeling manifold and flow regulator, a range of cargo area actuators and a variety of cargo-related products. Additionally, our Joint Strike Fighter and military helicopter OEM products are also seeing sustained solid sales. However, somewhat dampening the above OEM sales, for example, is the ramp down of the C-130 production rates and the related inventory drawdown associated with it. As we look forward, we're concerned that the military's reduction in aircraft utilization due to sequestration and the reduced operating tempo could reduce future demand for military spares.","Overall, the TransDigm operating units are performing well, given the uncertain economic environment. We continue to diligently control our entire cost structure. Our value-generation activities have continued to be effective across our businesses, and they also contributed to our first half results.","Now let me hand it over to Greg, our CFO, who will review the second quarter financial results in more detail.","Gregory Rufus","Thanks, Ray, and good morning again. I hope everyone had an opportunity to read our press release, which was issued this morning.","I'd also like to remind you that Nick's narrative of the business, including some of the financial results, is mostly on a pro forma basis, that is, assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods; while my focus is on GAAP results. So there may be slight differences in our year-over-year comparisons.","Before we begin, I want to remind you that we refinanced our $2.2 billion senior secured credit facility during the second quarter. We are happy that we were able to take advantage of a good credit market and make the following improvements: We reduced our total interest expense. We extended the maturity on $1.7 billion of the term loan and additional 3 years out to 2020, and we modified certain covenants to increase our overall flexibility, which aligns with our philosophy to also use our debt structure to help increase shareholder value.","Now let me review the quarterly financial results. Our second quarter net sales were $466 million, up $42 million or 10% from the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions, primarily AmSafe and Aero-Instruments, contributed the vast majority of the increase. Our organic sales growth was up about 2% over the prior year, primarily due to the commercial OEM and defense markets, which was already discussed in detail.","Reported gross profit was $259 million, up $23 million or 10%, which is in line with our sales growth versus the prior year. Gross profit margin is 55.7% of sales, which was flat when compared with the prior year. As Nick reconciled the few significant items impacting the EBITDA as defined margin compared to the prior year, these same items impact the gross margin between the 2 periods also.","The current quarter margin is closer to 58% after adjusting for the dilutive impact of the acquisition mix and unfavorable OEM to aftermarket mix. This 58% compares to a margin of about 54.5% in the prior year quarter when adjusted for the impact of inventory purchase accounting adjustments in the prior year and the onetime settlement for scope changes that Nick discussed. This comparative illustrates that the base business continue to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 9 point -- or 11.9% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.7% the prior year. This was a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter SG&A rate of 12.8%. We expect to run at a rate closer to 12% in the second half of fiscal '13 as we continue to pay close attention to our cost structure.","Interest expense of $64 million, an increase of approximately $12 million versus the prior year quarter. This is the result of an increase in our weighted average total debt to $4.3 billion in the current quarter versus $3.4 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt was due to the additional term loan of $500 million related to the AmSafe acquisition made in February of last year and the additional term loan and subordinated notes added to fund the dividend just paid in November, totaling approximately $700 million.","Our weighted average cash interest rate has decreased to 5.5% versus the 5.7% in the prior year. Refinancing cost of $30 million that was previously capitalized from our 2010 credit agreement when we acquired McKechnie were written off during the quarter in conjunction with the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility in February this year.","Our effective tax rate was 31.9% in the current quarter compared to 34.7% in the prior year. The quarter rate was primarily reduced by the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be between 33% and 34%.","Net income for the quarter decreased $14 million or 17% to $68 million. This compares to net income of $82 million in the prior year. The decrease with net income primarily reflects the onetime refinancing cost and the higher interest expense, partially offset by higher sales volume and the lower effective tax rate. Our GAAP earnings per share was $1.25 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.51 per share. The current quarter was significantly impacted by the onetime refinancing cost just mentioned, which is an impact of $0.38 per share.","Adjusted earnings per share was $1.74 per share, an increase of 6% compared to $1.65 per share last year. The increase in adjusted earnings per share was lower than the increase in sales, due primarily to the higher interest expense, partially offset by the lower effective tax rate.","The quarter adjustments to bridge GAAP and adjusted EPS are the following: The refinancing cost was $0.38 per share, the noncash compensation cost was $0.09 per share, and acquisition-related expenses were $0.02 per share.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity. We generated $240 million of cash during the first half of this year and ended with $680 million of cash on the balance sheet. The company's debt leverage ratio was 5.1x at pro forma EBITDA on a gross basis and 4.3x on a net basis.","As we expect, we continue to generate over $100 million of cash each quarter, and assuming no acquisition activity, we expect our debt leverage ratio to be 4.9x EBITDA on a gross basis and 3.9x on a net basis at the end of the year.","With regards to our fiscal '13 guidance, we have made some modest changes, which include slightly raising the midpoint of sales by tightening our guidance range and maintaining the midpoint of EBITDA. Our full year GAAP EPS guidance decreased to reflect the onetime refinancing cost, but adjusted EPS increased as a result of interest expense savings from the refinancing. The midpoint of our GAAP EPS is now $5.40, down $0.32 from the prior guidance, and adjusted EPS guidance is now $6.94, up $0.08 from the prior guidance. The $1.54 of adjustments to bridge GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS includes the following items: $0.70 from dividend equivalent payments, $0.38 from refinancing cost, $0.35 from noncash stock option expense and $0.11 from acquisition-related expenses.","With that, let me turn it back over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Let me -- this is Nick Howley. If I confused anybody, apparently once or twice, I used the wrong EBITDA margin for the second quarter. 47% was the reported EBITDA as adjusted margin if there was any confusion there.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Nick. [Operator Instructions] Allison, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Nick, could you comment on what the aftermarket growth second half over first half in fiscal '13 is now implied to be? And also the kind of how -- what's your -- it kind of sounded like you were counting more on the not this quarter recovery, but kind of a fourth quarter, your fiscal year recovery and then first quarter next fiscal year recovery. So just kind of -- so that our expectations are in line, how much of a hockey stick is it for this year still within that aftermarket guidance?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Let me start off, Myles, by saying, in case it's not transparently obvious, I don't know when the pick up's coming. I would say for the first half versus second half, as I think I said, I mean, it's essentially just math. We're up 1% the first half. To be 5% for the year, over 5%, we've got to be 9% or 10% for the second half.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry, I meant sequentially, second half over first half, not year-on-year.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Oh, yes, I don't know what that number is. I looked at it year-on-year is what I do know. But it's definitely up. It's got to be up to get there. The -- I guess we could -- Liza, we could figure that out. I just don't know the number as I sit here. What was your other question? Are you figuring to pickup more in the fourth -- our fourth quarter than our third quarter?","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, I don't -- I surely -- it feels to me like it's slipping out further. And I hear everybody else talking about the second half of their year, and the second half of their year starts in our fourth quarter. The further out I go, the better I feel about it. I think that's probably about the best I could tell you. I don't want to get into speculating about the next quarter yet.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the M&A pipeline, Nick, just maybe a quick comment on....","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, decent.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What you said was -- you said was active. But what -- I mean, what kind of size of deals are you looking at?","W. Nicholas  Howley","A range, a range. Not real big, but not real little ones either. We have some decent stuff in the pipeline.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just as a follow-up to the last question there. Last quarter, I think you pretty definitively said the M&A pipeline had picked up pretty noticeably, but I guess there's been -- I think there's been less activity than many of us would have expected. Can you maybe talk about where the breakpoints have been in conversations and what is it that's holding things up? Or is it just that the pipeline didn't pick up until 3 or 4 months ago, and it takes longer than that to make something happen?","W. Nicholas  Howley","I think it's more like that. I would say the things -- some of the things we've been working on, frankly, have been moving along slower than I might have hoped. You can't always control the speed of motion -- speed of movement on them. Well, I guess you can. You can give up on everything. But generally, we've seen some things moving. It's a little slower than we hope, but I just -- I'm very wary, and I'm very cautious about speculating on the rate of close on anything. But I would tell you, we're still pretty busy.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up on the margin detail you gave, which was very helpful.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess you've had AmSafe for over 1 year. I guess maybe the way to ask the question is, you talked about how you would be a little over 50%, call it 50.5% EBITDA as defined if you adjusted -- if you made all those adjustments. Maybe talk about when you think the timing is that you could crossover that on a reported basis.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Well, I think what we did tell you is, to meet our EBITDA goal for the year, we have to get close to 49% for the second half of the year. So that's, I would say, starting to get close to 50% again. I don't want to get into speculating what next year's quarters might look like, but I think we tried to give you a little bit of guidance in that our base business, the pre-McKechnie EBITDA margins if you would normalize for noise, in our view, are still moving up in the 1%, little over 1% a year. So you can almost take -- if you've got any -- wherever we stand, you'd expect, even it stopped sort of a significant improvement, you'd expect -- you could move the things 1 point a year. So 49% in the second half of the year starts to make you feel pretty good, all things being equal, and the next year you ought to be able to get there.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","And to put that timing in perspective, we closed on AmSafe in about the middle of February of last year. So when you look at the first half, we only owned them for about 40 days last year.","W. Nicholas  Howley","By the way, let me just back up on whoever asked me on the -- I think it was you -- I think it was Myles. The second half would have to be up. To get to the 5%, second half will have to be up 8% versus the first half. Now which I would say is not -- I wouldn't say that's impossible, but it's starting to feel like a pretty good stretch to me.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Nick, could you just clarify something you said earlier, which was about the pre-McKechnie margin expansion? You said it was up about 1%. Did I catch that right, and what was the time periods in?","W. Nicholas  Howley","The same 12-month period, first half '12 to first half '13, that's always what I'm talking about when I do that margin analysis.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And why might the pricing not have a bigger impact than that on those businesses?","W. Nicholas  Howley","I don't -- I'd have to think about that. The answer is a little over 1%.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","But you clearly still have the OEM aftermarket, and that's working against you.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Rob, I normalize that out, but I'm not sure we normalized all the pricing out of it.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But I figure this is mature business lines for you. You're very efficient. You get more efficient every year.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And you got pricing. So I just thought the 1% would be higher on the most mature stuff.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Well, it's a little over 1%. It's a little over 1%, but not -- it's a little over 1% is what I said, but that's about what it is, Rob. And I think an old business that we've had for a while, they're not going to hit infinity. So they're not going to hit 100%. These things are running at pretty high margins. It takes a fair amount to move them.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then is it fair just -- you've already talked a lot about the aftermarket trends and how this is pushing to the right, so you're not seeing any improvement in the bookings or the behavior very recently?","W. Nicholas  Howley","I don't want to get -- I don't want to talk about this quarter, Rob. I just don't -- I mean, I can't talk about this quarter and things that we haven't come out with yet. But I mean, you hear -- I guess you hear what I'm saying is, I hear everyone else talking about the second half of the calendar year, which is -- starts in our fourth quarter, and that sort of seems like it makes more sense to me.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right, and then you mentioned what SH&E told you, and they talked about Europe and Asia trends there. What's your relative exposure? I guess it tracks the fleet.","W. Nicholas  Howley","It tracks the fleet, Rob. We could take the installed base or the hours flown or something like that, and I would guess the 2 of them are -- I'm just going to say this from memory, 55% or something like that.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And have they given you some sense in doing this study, you talked about how you think Europe's recovery goes. What about Asia? What's the view on when you start to see that?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Their view on that, again, for what it's worth -- but I think, Rob, you probably know those guys. They're fairly knowledgeable. I mean, they do...","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I do know them.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, they do a lot of work on it. They keep a lot of track of it. Their general view for us was by next year, the Asian ones are pretty well sorted out and cranking along. They're a little more nervous about Europe.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. Just a last question for you on defense, with regard to the fact that you don't have sequestration in there, you've talked about the risk profile. But with the focus from DoD on maintenance and on pulling back flying hours and so on, don't you think you might be a little bit more conservative in the guidance there than what you're looking for here? It seems to me that could change sharply even in a quarter.","W. Nicholas  Howley","It could. Rob, I would say we are probably booked out now. Not booked out to the end of the year, but on defense, I'm going to say this. We're probably booked out more than 3 and less than 6 months, which doesn't get us all the way to the end of the year, but gets us close. Now they're -- as I said, there is always risk. Defense Department can cancel things. I'm assuming they don't cancel things. So that's what gives me a little more comfort. Usually, not never, but it's fairly unusual for them to start canceling orders they already placed.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of J. B. Groh of D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just playing off that last question, do you get a sense there's any sort of pull forward of aftermarket purchases, particularly in defense?","W. Nicholas  Howley","That's awful hard to know. It's obviously better than we expected. I would say that we're getting a pretty good pop from the 25% of our military business that's non-U.S. That's going along pretty well. But the orders are higher than we expected. So I don't exactly know why.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Does the profitability vary on the international business versus the domestic?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, I don't know that it's material.","Gregory Rufus","Not material, not material, yes.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then I just had a point of clarification. I think I heard you say, I was writing down, of 2% organic growth, but I saw in the press release it says flat. So what was the acquisition contribution?","W. Nicholas  Howley","This is -- you're talking about the aftermarket now?","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Oh, okay, that was just aftermarket.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Well, what I said about the aftermarket is it was on a reported basis for the quarter, the aftermarket revenues were down less than 1%, but there were less days than the previous quarter. If you adjusted it per days, it was up about 2.5%, and it was the same sort of relationship for the first half of the year. It's just -- it's the way holidays fall in our quarterly cutoffs.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Got you. But overall, organic was flat if you don't adjust for the days.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, definitely. So what I said, you've got one little up and the other a little down. I call that about flat.","Gregory Rufus","You were just talking aftermarket.","W. Nicholas  Howley","The aftermarket I'm talking about, commercial aftermarket.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Nick, to follow-up on the acquisition front, I was wondering if you could comment on what sort of prices you're seeing potential sellers are trying to get at the moment, but also if you're seeing any more competition for these assets than you'd normally see.","W. Nicholas  Howley","I really can't say I see a substantive change in the market dynamics, either people in or pricing levels. I mean, good stuff typically sells at a pretty good price, but I can't say I've seen some significant difference in market participants. Probably the only way that realistically happens would be to get a bunch of PE guys jumping in on the deals, and we haven't seen a lot of that.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the aftermarket. I was wondering if you could comment on your pricing environment if there's been any changes there, and if you strip out pricing that if -- whether your aftermarket volumes were actually down year-on-year?","W. Nicholas  Howley","No, there's no change in the pricing environment. If you strip out pricing, they are down.","Operator","And your next question comes from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So just a follow-up call on the work you've done to try to understand the weakness in the commercial aftermarket. You mentioned that you see a long-term positive in some of the new platforms you're on. Any findings in terms of weakness in some of the more important platforms for you today? In other words, is your platform mix an incremental headwind here?","W. Nicholas  Howley","No. That's what I tried to say, just to be clear. If you strip out the new platforms, which I'll define as CSeries, 787 and new Airbus A380, not too much A350 because it's not all defined yet. But if you strip that out, at least the conclusions that we got on the base aftermarket business was still that the positions were such that you could expect to grow slightly above the RPM growth rate, which says you have a pretty good distribution of parts. If you add the new ones on, the estimate was you'd grow a bit above the RPM rate. Now that says to me you've got a decent portfolio mix, and that was one of the main goals we gave them or a scope definition in the job, by the way.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. Got it. And then just a follow-up question also on the pricing dynamic. I know you're limited on what you can say about Aerosonic, but it does seem that, at least on the EBITDA basis, it looks pretty pricey. Maybe you can help us understand how maybe it's not as pricey as it looks.","W. Nicholas  Howley","It's -- I just simply can't talk about that. It's a public company. And they're going through the tender process, and I just can't say anything about it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Seth on for Joe this morning. Just had one question, maybe about commercial OE and the strength in the quarter on a very strong quarter last year and the increase in the guidance. Last quarter, you seemed quite concerned about the 787 inventory overhang and the flattening OE production profile. How's your thinking about the commercial OE market changed since last quarter?","W. Nicholas  Howley","I don't know that our view has changed a lot since the last quarter, and I don't know that I can make any judgment from one quarter on the OE production rates and inventory drawdown. That's more like a multiple year issue than a 3- or 6-month issue.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so you still have that similar outlook for flattening production and a lot of 787 inventory out there?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, I think we go through that sort of once a year what our view is of the subsequent year production rates. I think I will address that when we do the next -- when we do our next year's guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company.","Lucy Guo","It's Lucy in for Gautam, who sends his regards. I just have a follow-up on your defense business. What was the revenue trend sequentially and was there any change in the order trends in April?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Well, we can't talk about anything beyond the published information at the end of March. We'll talk about the next quarter when we talk about it.","Gregory Rufus","Sequentially.","W. Nicholas  Howley","Sequentially, I don't...","Liza Sabol","She's asking revenues, right?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, sequential revenues in defense I think she's been asking. I mean, generally, it's going better than we anticipated. I don't remember the exact number.","Lucy Guo","And then can you just refresh my memory on...","W. Nicholas  Howley","We did tell you that the bookings continue to run ahead of the shipments, and we're going to figure out the sequential number here in a minute. Go ahead.","Lucy Guo","And can you just refresh my memory on the contingency for sequestration, your outlook, your defense outlook?","W. Nicholas  Howley","We are assuming that -- the biggest assumption is that we will not get any cancellations. In other words, we are probably booked out for a good part of the year. It's more than 3 and less than 6 months we're booked out, and we only got 6 months left in the year. So I think we're pretty comfortable if we don't start to get cancellations or things don't just stop. I don't know if I can give you a number on that.","Lucy Guo","Okay, is there any cancellations that's out of the ordinary so far?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes. I would say I don't think -- surely, I can't tell if it's you 0 across the company, but I can tell you there has been no substantive or material cancellations from the government. We have not seen them do that. Generally, they do not, but they have the right to. Defense contracts can almost always be canceled for convenience, which means they have to pay you whatever money you have in it and a negotiated markup. They typically don't do that because they'd rather have the product and pay half the money and not get the product. Of course, they can do it, but they can -- they have the right to do it.","Lucy Guo","Right. And finally, just in broad terms can you talk about any discussions you may have with Boeing regarding their partnering for success initiative, and are the discussions on a business by business basis or a company-wide basis?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Both. And I really don't -- yes, we're a supplier like all other suppliers are to them. Yes, they're discussing with us also. I really am not willing to get into -- I don't want to get into details of our discussion with individual customers. By the way, what is it, sequentially that shipment? Defense is high-single digits increase sequentially. That's a percentage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Nick, going back to the margin discussion. I guess my question is around AmSafe and how AmSafe is doing. I think I would have thought even with the dilution from AmSafe and the aftermarket mix hurting going against you, I would have thought, given some underlying improvement in AmSafe, that the margins will be a little bit better than what we're seeing today. So can you just talk about how AmSafe is progressing maybe relative to what you saw with McKechnie.","W. Nicholas  Howley","AmSafe is -- you're not going to get as rapid an increase like McKechnie because you do have at least a net business. It's not going to change as much. It's not as good a business. The...","Raymond F. Laubenthal","The net and cargo.","W. Nicholas  Howley","The net and cargo business, which is the smaller, smaller portion. I would say the big chunk, which is the seatbelts, is moving along very nicely and is starting to look a lot like a TransDigm business. I think that's probably about the best I can tell you on it. That's the big chunk is the aerospace seatbelts, and that's looking very good to us. The net business is not -- is looking fairly good, too. It's just the margins that are low. So you're moving a -- you're trying to move a 10% margin to a 20% or something, it doesn't look as dramatic when you add it all up. And the ground business is about flat.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And at this point, you're still -- you're thinking that you're still going to hold on to that business or is it...","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, it'll be -- we're surely going to hold onto it for another year. It's really not a big enough business to make much impact on anything when you take the revenue times the EBITDA. So it's sort of a value call after a while. Does it make any sense to sell something if you have to substantially discount what the EBITDA is valued at? You know what I mean? Plus you get the tax leakage. Usually it's easiest to do them all bang, bang, bang right around the time of the acquisition.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And then cash. It sounds like the cash balance is going to be a little bit higher than what you were seeing earlier by the end of the year. I guess given this, what you highlighted slow progress on the acquisition side, I mean, how long do you sit around with this much cash on the balance sheet?","W. Nicholas  Howley","David, I think you've seen before, we don't sit around too long so.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. I guess typically when you paid special dividends have been end of the calendar year. I mean, could something happen earlier than that?","W. Nicholas  Howley","I don't want to -- now I'm being evasive, of course. I would say in the capital markets, something could happen whenever it seems right. I would suspect it would be more towards the back end of the year, though. I mean, I think we probably keep looking and wringing our hands for a while before we do it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of Imperial Capital.","Kenneth Herbert - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up specifically on the work that SH&E did. How is that perhaps changing 2 things, either your approach to acquisitions as you look at opportunities there or perhaps the existing product portfolio. And I'd expect maybe there's some rationalization or other output of that that may ultimately happen. But just a little bit on sort of how you're going to use that moving forward from those 2 standpoints would be helpful.","W. Nicholas  Howley","I wouldn't expect that to drive any kind of product rationalization or selling things off or anything like that. The main scope we were trying to understand is, is there anything, I'll say, discontinuous or unusual about our portfolio that's making this aftermarket stay down longer than we might have hoped? The biggest part of the scope was to go through and figure all our parts, which we thought we knew, and gave us a second set of eyes to figure out all our products on the chipsets, then extend that by the hours of flight and things like that on each of the chipsets, and tell us whether we have a portfolio that's better weighted, the same as or a little worse than the market. That was probably the biggest part of it. And the second was, can you give us any sense as to why this market's staying down? And those are the 2 things that I tried to talk to you about. I think the summary we got is, we feel pretty good about the portfolio of products we have. So I wouldn't see us doing anything significantly different with them. On acquisitions, we'll buy what we always buy. We'll buy proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We're not trying to fill a hole in or something like that. It's hard enough to find good ones without getting put too many boundary conditions on it.","Kenneth Herbert - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. So it's safe to say then that you didn't find anything in the research that was TransDigm-specific in terms of the impact right now?","W. Nicholas  Howley","No, no.","Kenneth Herbert - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","From a negative standpoint?","W. Nicholas  Howley","No.","Kenneth Herbert - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And then if I could just -- you've talked about, and I know you've mentioned the 4 count -- 4% headcount reduction and the puts and takes you're facing with better-than-expected strength on the OE side relative to aftermarket and implications for the resources you need to put in play here. If that continues, is that a significant barrier to your ability to continue to look at the cost structure? Or how should we think about the puts and takes of that as we go through the rest of the year?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Yes, we give you -- headcount is a sort of one -- it's a proxy for cost structure. It's not perfect, right, there's other things and specifically there's outside buys is the other thing. But if the OEM mix continues to get higher, this is just the same -- it's another way of saying that there's a mix impact. You need more people and more effort to produce a part for OEM than you do a part for the aftermarket per dollar of revenue just because they're priced differently. So if the difference kept going on for a period of time, it would get increasingly difficult to get the headcount balanced up with the revenue or the volume. We do not see that as a problem now. Historically, we have been able to -- it hasn't slowed so drastically that we have not been able to get the cost structure adjusted. And I don't see that in the foreseeable future right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe, Nick, just on the SH&E, did you guys learn anything regarding your pricing power or the pricing environment? Do you think that will be sustainable? And then I guess the other kind of part to that with SH&E is, they're forecasting some pretty big military headwinds on parts purchasing. How do you guys think about dealing with that headwind on the portfolio over the next, beyond sort of next 6 months?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Well, just to be clear, I only spoke about the commercial business. Anything having to do with SH&E, as I talked about, was only to do with the commercial business, not the defense business.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, so you didn't get an opinion on military. Okay.","W. Nicholas  Howley","What I spoke about was the commercial business.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you.","W. Nicholas  Howley","I thought they may or may not be on -- the defense business is separate from that. We didn't ask them to opine, particularly on our pricing capabilities, but we don't see nor have we seen any change in the dynamics there.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, just a couple of follow-ups. On the parting out discussion within the aftermarket specifically, is that something where you're able to actually locate in the customer data that that's not happening or where you have some hard concrete evidence that that's not happening, or is it just that the consultant agreed with your logic and intuition as to why that wouldn't happen to you?","W. Nicholas  Howley","Well, what they know is they have a pretty good idea of what is getting parted out, because people are forever hiring them to study that and study what they can part out and sell. So they know the kind of things that are. I can't tell you they know every part number, and they know sort of the dollar price points and the type of things people are buying, and their conclusion is somewhat the same ours has been. For relatively low dollar value items, people tend to not do it.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So they see the actual parts. It's not just -- they weren't just making it a higher level...","W. Nicholas  Howley","No. They got -- they see the prices, the unit prices and things like that for us when they go through it. And they don't meet their criteria for the kind of things they've been seeing parted out. Now the answer is never 100% or 0, but it's not a significant factor. Either the PMA stuff you can get a little bit better beat on because you can look up what's been or hasn't been approved by the FAA. So we have a pretty good idea that, that's de minimis.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then did you give your expectation for interest expense for the full year?","Gregory Rufus","The absolute dollar or the rate?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Absolute dollar.","Gregory Rufus","About $250 million for the year, yes.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it.","W. Nicholas  Howley","You woke Greg up with that one. He thought he was gone for the day.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Liza Sabol for closing remarks.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. That concludes our call for today.

My name is Colby, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. I would like to thank all of you that have called in today, and welcome you to TransDigm's Fiscal 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Ray Laubenthal; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus. A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next 2 weeks. Replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley","Good morning, and thanks for calling in to hear about our company again. I'd like to start with some comments about our consistent strategy, the acquisition of AmSafe, our current sense of the status of the aerospace market as it applies to our business and a few miscellaneous items.","To reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle.","To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, and you can look at Page 4 of the slides, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products, and around 3\/4 of our net sales come from products for which we are the sole source provider. About 60% of our revenue and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability in the downturns.","Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, typically about 50% of revenues and relatively low capital expenditure requirements, typically less than 2% of revenue, TransDigm's year in, year out generated very strong free cash flow. We pay close attention to our capital structure and view it as another means to create shareholder value. As you know, we have in the past and continue to be willing to lever up when we either see good opportunities or view our leverage as sub-optimum for value creation. We typically begin to delever pretty quickly.","We have a well-proven, value-based operating strategy focused around what we refer to as our 3 value drivers: new business development, continual cost improvement and value-based pricing. We stick to these concepts as the core of our operating management methods. This consistent approach has worked for us through up and down markets and has allowed us to continually improve and increase the intrinsic value of our business while steadily investing in new business and platform positions.","We have also been successful in regularly acquiring and integrating businesses. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We've been able to acquire and improve proprietary aerospace businesses through all phases in the cycle. Through our consistent focus on our operating value drivers, a very clear acquisition strategy and close attention to our capital structure, we have been able to create intrinsic value for our shareholders for many years through up and down markets.","The just-completed quarter was active. We closed on the AmSafe acquisition for $750 million. To remind you, the AmSafe price includes tax benefits over the next 10 years to TransDigm in the range of $70 million on a net present value basis. The tax benefits are front-end weighted with about $20 million of them accruing to us in the first fiscal year of ownership.","AmSafe is a good, solid proprietary aerospace business. It did about $260 million a year in calendar year 2011 with an EBITDA margin of about 25%. In the 7.5 months of our fiscal year 2012 ownership, we expect AmSafe to do about $175 million of revenue and about $50 million of EBITDA As Defined.","The commercial aerospace margins are higher than the average, and the ground vehicle margins are substantially lower. About 90% of its EBITDA comes from commercial aerospace and military markets, of which the vast majority is commercial aerospace. We find the low military content, about 10% of the revenue, and very high commercial aerospace aftermarket content particularly attractive. Excluding the commercial ground vehicle business, about 85% of the revenues are aftermarket, primarily commercial transport aftermarket.","The major AmSafe product lines are seatbelts and airbags for commercial aircraft, primarily commercial transport. They are qualified, usually exclusively, on all major commercial transport and regional aircraft.","After 2.5 months of ownership, we are very comfortable with our ability to increase the value through a mix of all 3 of our value drivers. Though I don't know that this business can achieve EBITDA percent as highest as TransDigm average, we see significant upside at least as good as our acquisition case assumptions.","We financed the acquisition with $500 million of incremental bank debt and from our cash on hand. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 3% with a 1% LIBOR floor, or 4% as of today. We also increased our revolver availability to $310 million as part of the process. We have now included AmSafe in our updated full year guidance.","At 3\/31\/12, we had about $200 million in cash and over $300 million in undrawn revolver. We also, on average, expect to generate between $90 million and $100 million a quarter in additional cash for the last 2 quarters of fiscal year 2012. We have additional borrowing capacity under our credit agreement. We estimate our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a pro forma basis at 3\/31 reflecting the AmSafe acquisition as about 4.7x EBITDA. Our net debt to EBITDA is about 4.4. As in the past, absent acquisitions or other capital market activities, we will soon delever.","Changing subjects a little, you may have seen we recently prevailed in the litigation against Eaton Corporation regarding improper retention and possible use of our intellectual property and nonpayment of certain aftermarket-related obligations. Just to make clear, we have here and will continue to vigorously protect our intellectual property. We have not included the litigation award in any of our guidance as we are unsure if or how much of it may be appealed, how we will fare on fee recovery issues and a number of miscellaneous peripherals.","We also settled 2 retroactive contract adjustments with key customers for a total of about $11 million. These have been booked about evenly in Q1 and Q2 as revenue and income.","Now with respect to our underlying markets and on a pro forma basis, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods, the markets are a little bumpy, but generally on track. We see continuing signs of strong commercial aftermarket. The defense aftermarket, though less clear, is so far holding up better that we outlined in our prior guidance.","Focusing a little bit on the different market segments. In the Commercial OEM, industry forecasters and airframe manufacturers continue to be optimistic regarding the commercial transport OEM production cycles. Rate increases are proceeding at both Airbus and Boeing. The 787 schedule is still unclear, but that won't materially impact fiscal year 2012. On a positive note, at least now there are some 787 airframe shipments. In total, our full year commercial transport OEM revenues on a pro forma basis are now expected to be up in the high teen percents versus the prior year.","In business jets, though the outlook is mixed by airframe manufacturer, we expect mid to high-teen percent growth year-over-year. In the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see growth in worldwide passenger traffic, though not as high as last year's growth. To remind you, last year, our commercial aftermarket was up almost 25% on a year-over-year basis. This was likely not a sustainable level.","This quarter, we saw modest increases over our prior Q2 in our commercial aftermarket revenue. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket revenues were about flat versus Q1 this year. On a positive note, incoming orders or bookings picked up nicely and are now running above our shipment levels on both a year-to-date basis and a prior Q2 basis, as well as sequentially. As I've said before, bookings can be lumpy. We are still guiding pro forma commercial aftermarket revenues to be up about 10% versus last year. We are watching this carefully. The revenue comps, I'll remind everybody, get tougher in the second half of the year.","In the defense business, though there are still major uncertainties around defense spending, we now anticipate defense revenues to be flat to modestly up in fiscal year 2012. Though Q1 and Q2 were better than anticipated, we remain cautious. As I mentioned before regarding the commercial aftermarket, the defense comps also get tougher in the second half of the year. Military revenues are tough to predict, especially given the current U.S. political wins and the worldwide geopolitical situation.","Now let me turn to the latest financial performance. I'll remind you this is the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2011. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by differences in OEM aftermarket mix, large orders and transient inventory fluctuations in the system, modest seasonality and other factors.","But the second quarter of fiscal year '12 was a good quarter. GAAP revenues were up about 39% versus the prior Q2. Organic revenues were up about 15% on a quarter versus prior quarter basis.","Reviewing the revenues by market category, again on a pro forma basis versus the prior year, and you can see this on Slide 5, this is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both quarters. I will note that these pro forma comps do not include the 2 most recent acquisitions, that's Harco and AmSafe, as we're still syncing their market reporting up with TransDigm's.","In the commercial market, which makes up about 75% of our revenue, Commercial OEM revenues, as I said, were up 36% versus the prior Q2 and 28% on a year-to-date basis. Commercial transport OEM and biz jet OEM revenue growth were about in the same range. Excluding the impact of the retroactive contract settlements, the increase in revenues was a little over 20% on a year-to-date basis in the Commercial OEM sector.","In the commercial aftermarket, revenue was up about 7% on a Q2 versus Q2 basis and about 13% on a year-to-date basis. Though the specifics are unclear, anecdotally, there seems to be indication of some inventory trimming at certain airlines and a generalized economic concern by European airlines. I can't at this time quantify this much further. As I mentioned, bookings are now running ahead of shipments on a year-to-date basis. We are watching trends here very closely, and we'll update you as we proceed through the year. But so far, the commercial aftermarket is about what we expected.","In the defense markets, which make up about 25% of our revenue, the defense picture was again better than we expected. As an aside, I should probably stop forecasting this before I embarrass myself further but on the other hand, I have to say something. The revenues were up 10% on a Q2 versus prior Q2 basis. On a year-to-date basis, we're up about 3.5% versus the prior year, the full year average run rate. Incoming orders ran ahead of shipping again in Q2. We'll see how this plays out. As I've said, the military picture is not clear. For obvious reasons, we remain cautious. In total for the quarter, our revenues were a bit better than we expected.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The major As Defined adjustments are made up of acquisition and stock option expenses, Greg will review various other items on the income statement also. For Q2, our EBITDA As Defined of $203 million was up 39% versus the prior year Q2 As Defined or EBITDA As Defined. The EBITDA As Defined margin is 48% for the quarter, the same as the prior year Q2. The year-to-date EBITDA As Defined margin is roughly 49% of revenue.","Now there are a number of moving parts that complicate the EBITDA margin event, and let me try and clarify that a little bit, at least on a year-to-date basis. If you break out the EBITDA margins a little more finely, if you take the base business including McKechnie, our EBITDA revenues, again EBITDA As Defined, was about 50% of revenue. This is in spite of an OEM aftermarket mix down. The Schneller, Harco and AmSafe acquisitions combined diluted the EBITDA margin about 2% or 2% down, and the impact of the 2 retroactive contract settlements moved the EBITDA margin up about 1%. And I think that comes to the 49%.","With respect to M&A activity, as I said we closed one acquisition in Q2 2012, that is AmSafe, for about $750 million. We continue looking at opportunities. Al's been pretty busy working the AmSafe deal and various follow-on items, and the pipeline's a little light at the moment. Closings, on the other hand, are always very difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on our clear value-creation opportunity and strategy here.","Now regarding the fiscal year '12 guidance, and this is on Slide 6. There are also a number of moving pieces increase affecting our guidance. The operations performed well in Q2 in the first half. The OEM aftermarket mix is continuing to run against this a little. The AmSafe acquisition is closed, and we have now resolved these $11 million in contract settlements.","I'll refer to the midpoints and all the following numbers. Again, the numbers now include AmSafe, but there's no additional acquisitions or settlements included in these. Based on all of the above, we have increased the midpoint of our EPS as-adjusted guidance by $0.57 a share from $5.83 to $6.40. Almost 2\/3 of the increase is attributable to the AmSafe acquisition net of the incremental interest.","We now expect TD's revenues to be about $1.68 billion or up $194 million from our prior guidance. The vast majority is due to the AmSafe acquisition with the balance split between contract settlement, improved Commercial OEM revenues and some slight improvement in defense.","The 2012 EBITDA As Defined is now anticipated to be about $800 million, up $67 million from our previous guidance. Almost 3\/4 of this increase comes from the AmSafe acquisition.","On a full year basis, the EBITDA As Defined margin of 48% is roughly made up as follows. The base business, again including McKechnie, should run about 51% of revenues for the full year, and it continues to move up. Again, this is in spite of the mix down drag. Schneller, Harco and AmSafe full year dilution is about 3.5% down on the margin, and the impact of the 2 Boeing contract settlements is about 0.5%, up on a full year basis, and that should settle you to the 48%.","Compared to 2012 and on a pro forma basis, we are now planning on full year commercial aerospace OEM revenues to be up in the high-teen percents. For commercial aerospace aftermarket on a pro forma basis, we are still planning on full year revenue growth at about 10% based on a worldwide traffic up 4% to 5% year-over-year. We'll keep watching this closely and adjust as required as the year proceeds. For defense revenues, on the same basis, we are now planning year-over-year revenues to be flat to modestly up. Again, I think I should probably give up handicapping this, but there I go.","In summary, the first quarter was a good start to the year, and Q2 continued that. The market seemed to be roughly on track but in any event, I'm confident that by focusing on our consistent strategy, we could continue to create intrinsic value in good and bad times.","Now let me hand it over to Ray Laubenthal, our COO, who will discuss a few operating items from the quarter.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thanks, Nick. We had a busy second quarter and a good first half. We continued our consistent disciplined approach to value creation with our recent acquisition in our existing businesses.","We started the quarter with a sprint by AmSafe. This was a good example of how we can move quickly. In December, we became aware of the potential sale of AmSafe. We immediately attended the management meeting and assembled a due diligence team. And in a short period, we visited their major operating sites in Phoenix, Elkhart, Anaheim, Erie, Bridport in the U.K., Kunshan in China and Sri Lanka. We conducted due diligence on their major customers and determined the strength of their proprietary products.","The resulting data from our due diligence confirmed our originally assessment that AmSafe was a good fit with TransDigm and on February 15, we closed the deal. Again, this was a good example of our consistent acquisition strategy and of how we can move quickly and efficiently when a potential acquisition meets our stringent criteria.","Once we took ownership of AmSafe, we immediately launched our disciplined value-equation process. To date, in less than 90 days, we've restructured the AmSafe spares pricing, initiated several plant consolidation and tightened up the cost structure with significant headcount reduction. We're now working to organize this business into our proven product line operational structure. Overall, the transition activities are progressing well.","On our other recent acquisitions, Schneller and Harco, they're also progressing well. Schneller's Kent, Ohio building expansion is well underway, and we're on track to close their Florida facility and consolidate it with the Kent operations next quarter. We have installed a new President at Schneller, and we have moved our experienced Sales and Marketing Director from our Avtech Tyee Group to be the Director of Sales and Marketing at Schneller.","At both Schneller and Harco, the pricing has been restructured and cost reductions have been implemented. In addition to these actions, we've reorganized these 2 businesses into our product line structure. Each product line has a Product Line Manager responsible for the product line P&L along with the underlying pricing, new business generation and productivity improvement.","Now I'd like to switch gears and talk about our senior management team. These acquisitions resulted in a significant number of management promotions. Our continual emphasis on succession planning and talent development paid off well for us. We were able to populate most of the key management positions with internal candidates. These proven candidates are steeped in our value-focused culture and value-creation processes.","In Q1, we promoted Jim Skulina to Executive VP. Jim has been with us since 1994, performing well in a broad range of assignments ranging from Division Controller, Director of Manufacturing, Corporate Controller and President of Aero Fluid Products. Jim has led numerous acquisition consolidation and has fostered significant value creation during all of his assignments with TransDigm. In his current EVP role, Jim will have oversight of a number of our existing businesses.","In the second quarter after our acquisition of AmSafe, we promoted Pete Palmer to Executive Vice President. Pete started with TransDigm in 1999 as a Product Line Manager at our AdelWiggins unit. He then became the Director of Sales and Marketing there. He later moved to our corporate offices as Director of Mergers and Acquisitions. After we purchased CDA, Pete became the Operating Unit President there. He then moved on to become president of our CEF unit. And he has spent the last few years as President of our AdelWiggins unit. In his current Executive Vice President role, Pete will have a number of operating units reporting to him.","To replace Jim and Pete, we promoted 2 internal candidates to fill in as President at Aero Fluid Products and then at AdelWiggins. Both of these new Presidents held a variety of managerial positions creating value at TransDigm, and their replacements were also promoted from internal positions are Product Line Manager and Manufacturing Manager.","We believe the availability of promotable internal talent and our consistent succession development process effectively complements our disciplined value-creation methods and is a key to our ability to regularly acquire and integrate new businesses.","Now let me hand it over to Greg Rufus, our CFO, who will review our second quarter financial results in more detail.","Gregory Rufus","Thanks, Ray, and good morning to everyone. I hope everyone had an opportunity to read our press release, which was issued this morning.","In typical TransDigm fashion, the current quarter in comparison to the prior year are significantly impacted by recent acquisitions and financing activities. Let me remind you that we acquired Schneller in the fourth quarter in September or August of 2011, Harco in December in the first quarter of fiscal year '12 and AmSafe in February in our second quarter just closed. In addition, we financed the AmSafe acquisition with a new $500 million term loan, and we used $250 million of cash during the quarter to complete it. Before I begin, please reference Slide 7 for our quarterly financial results.","Our second quarter net sales were $423.5 million, up $119.2 million or 39.2% from the prior year. There are 2 significant explanations for this large increase. The first is the collective impact of the acquisitions of Schneller, Harco and AmSafe. These acquisitions contributed $73.8 million of additional sales versus the prior period or almost 2\/3 of the increase in sales.","Not to be overshadowed by the impact of our recent acquisitions, our organic growth was 14.9% greater than the prior year. All market channels contributed to this growth as follows: $30.5 million from Commercial OEM, and this included the retroactive contract adjustment of approximately $6 million; $6.4 million from the commercial aftermarket sales; and $8.5 million from defense sales, driven primarily by OEM shipments.","Reported gross profit was $236 million or 55.7% of sales. The reported gross profit margin increased by approximately 4 percentage points versus the prior year. Collectively, our gross profit percentage on our core business increased by approximately 2 margin points due to the following: the strength of our proprietary products and continued productivity improvements, along with positive leverage in our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume; the favorable retroactive contract adjustment mentioned earlier contributed just over 0.5 margin point at the gross profit line; and partially offsetting these favorable items was unfavorable OEMs aftermarket product mix.","In addition, the decrease of purchase accounting items and acquisition integration costs as a percent of sales increased the gross profit percentage by 3 margin points. This is primarily due to decreased inventory step-ups and related start-up costs associated with the McKechnie acquisition in the prior year. These net increases were partially offset by the dilutive impact of Schneller, Harco and AmSafe by approximately 1 margin point at the gross profit line.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 10.9% for the prior year. The increase is primarily due to a higher run rate of selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales from recent acquisitions. This run rate will continue to increase in the second half, but typically improves over time under TransDigm ownership.","Amortization of intangibles was $2.1 million lower versus the prior year due to backlog related to McKechnie and Talley becoming fully amortized in quarter one of 2012. This drop off more than offset additional amortization from the recent acquisitions of Schneller, Harco and AmSafe.","Net interest expense was $52.3 million, a decrease of $1.8 million versus the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in the total weighted average interest rate on total borrowings at the end of the quarter to 6.2% compared to 6.9% for the second quarter last year. The impact of the lower interest rate was partially offset by an increase in weighted average total debt to $3.39 billion in the current quarter versus $3.15 billion in the prior year. The increase in weighted average debt was due to the additional term loan related to the AmSafe acquisition in February of this year.","Our effective tax rate was approximately 35% for the current quarter, and we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35% for the full year. We expect our cash taxes to be about $100 million for the full year.","Net income from continuing operations for the quarter increased $44.9 million or 122.2% to $81.6 million, which is 19.3% of sales. This compares to net income from continuing operations of $36.7 million in the prior year. Income from continuing operations increased by a significantly higher percentage versus the prior year than our overall increase in sales of 39.2% due to the lower acquisition-related costs and lower amortized -- amortization of intangible assets versus the prior quarter; leverage on our lower interest expense, which declined by 3.4% versus the prior quarter; and the lower effective income tax rate versus the prior year.","Net income from discontinued operations in the comparable quarter a year ago was $19.1 million or $0.35 per share. This was related to the McKechnie fastener and distribution businesses that were sold in 2011.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.51 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.69 per share a year ago due to the increase in the net income from continuing operations that I just discussed. The adjusted earnings per share was $1.65 per share, an increase of 72% compared to $0.96 per share. This percentage increase is higher than our sales increase of 39% due primarily from leverage on the lower interest expense this quarter versus the prior year.","The quarter adjustments to GAAP earnings per share were $0.14 per share. The adjustments net of tax are: acquisition-related expenses of $0.08 per share and noncash compensation cost of $0.06 per share. Cash flow from operations was strong at $165 million in the first half of 2012. Despite using $333 million of cash on the balance sheet to help partially fund the acquisitions of Harco and AmSafe, we ended the quarter with almost $200 million of cash on the balance sheet.","Our net debt leverage ratio was 4.4x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined. We expect to continue to delever throughout the year, and we project that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 4x EBITDA As Defined on September 30.","Moving to guidance. We estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $5.64 and as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $6.40. The $0.76 of adjustments to bridge GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.06 from dividend equivalent payments paid in the first quarter, $0.23 from noncash stock option expense and $0.47 of acquisition-related expenses.","Now let me hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Julie. So with 15% organic growth in the first half of the year, what's the total organic growth you're assuming in the full year revenue guidance? And has that changed from what you were assuming in the prior guidance?","Gregory Rufus","Just with the sense, it's up a little bit. It hasn't changed dramatically.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, and it's probably up a little. I just -- I don't have the number in my head, Julie. This is Nick Howley. But the Commercial OEM's up a little bit. Defense is up a little bit, and commercial aftermarket is about the same. So a little bit.","Julie Yates - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, but it looks like it might decelerate a little bit in the back half of the year, maybe be high single digits, low double digits. Does that sound about right?","W. Nicholas Howley","No. I just don't have the number in my head. Greg, do you?","Gregory Rufus","Yes, we have the second half when you look at it on this basis excluding some of the acquisitions of being more in the high teens...","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes, yes. You're right. You're right, Julie.","Julie Yates - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay, and then just a housekeeping for Greg. What was the interest expense you're embedding in your full year guidance number?","Gregory Rufus","Well, the interest in depreciation and amortization combined, Julie, was $0.26 per share. I don't have the absolute number in front of me right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Nick, I wondered if you might talk to what's driving the military strength if you can see anything in the kind of granular data of whether or not it's helicopters or what's going on that it keeps surprising us?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes, first, Carter, I don't think we're the only one it's surprising. If you look across the product lines, it's fairly broadly doing better. I would say in specifics, a couple of things that do jump out is the helicopters are continuing to do better. That's helicopter maintenance, spare parts, all that -- upgrades, all that sort of thing. And we saw a couple of decent F-35 shipments here too in this quarter. Those are probably the 2 things that might stick out other than just generally it's not dropping as much as we thought.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great, and the second relates to just M&A. I know you said the pipeline was a little light, but I wondered if you might comment on the types of deals you're seeing out there. If you're seeing any impact from sort of looming tax changes, and whether or not that's got sellers interested or not or what kind of deals are out there? Are there anything new or are you working the same list? Any detail would be helpful.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, I can't talk anything specific, of course. Let me take your questions in the order you asked them, Carter. I -- we do the tax change pitch all the time for people. We'll see to try to get them to sell. I honestly can say we haven't got a lot of biting on that. People listen, but they don't seem to move much on it. We had the same thing in 2010, so I can't take much comfort in that. I would say on the deals we are seeing, I would say the type of things we're seeing right now are typically the smaller type of things that we traditionally saw. That being said, as you know, particularly bigger things can just pop up on you quickly. I mean we're tracking them, but we don't know of anything right now that's popping up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Thanks for the additional color around adjusted EBITDA margins by business or by the base business. That's where my question is. You talked about 50% adjusted EBITDA margins for the base business with McKechnie and 51% for the full year. Can you give us an idea, Nick, of maybe the spread between the base in McKechnie, how McKechnie is tracking relative to that 50%, 51% number.","W. Nicholas Howley","No, we really don't disclose that. But what I wanted to do is that I wanted to give you that number so you can get a pretty good sense. McKechnie is a decent-sized business, and the base businesses were somewhere around 50% before we bought it. So you can do the math and see it's got to be doing pretty well, right? Or you couldn't -- McKechnie is in the 50%, 51%.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, sure. I assume...","W. Nicholas Howley","We don't -- specifically, we don't disclose them.","Gregory Rufus","Well frankly, we don't even add up. There's no such thing as a McKechnie. We don't even add that total up, David. I mean, we've incorporated corporate into our corporate headquarters. We have 3 units, and we don't get any management benefits for it, but we know -- it's moving up, and that was Nick's point that it was doing good.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, maybe that's the best way to say. It's not an identifiable entity anymore.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, and then on the AmSafe, you bought the business, it was 25% EBITDA margins. Now it sounds like it's 30%, so moving up there. Can you talk about where that 5% is coming from? And then also where does it stand on an EBIT basis? I think you had talked about the ability to kind of stretch out the amortization period. Where does it stand on an EBIT basis?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, let me deal with -- on the EBIT, Greg, you can address. I think we -- on the tax, we gave you an indication of how much tax benefit we get in this 7.5-month period. On the move in the margin, it's the normal stuff. We own the business, and we start to give in, and we start to -- we brought the cost down, we've adjusted the cost structure already, we're starting some consolidations of some plants, we're adjusting the pricing. It's the whole range of things that we do when we buy a business. And it's starting to kick in.","Gregory Rufus","David, in our guidance, and I don't know if this will help your confuse you, but total depreciation and amortization for AmSafe on an annualized basis will be just a little over $15 million now that we've settled through everything. I don't know if this -- that helps you or not.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's this year, or that's a full year run rate?","Gregory Rufus","That's a full year run rate.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, okay, now that helps. And then last one for me. What's the latest thinking on what to do with the ground vehicle business?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, if we -- as I've said before, that doesn't fit with us particularly. It's just a question of whether we think we can get a price that makes sense to us. And we're sort of going through the process now of trying to sort that out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the commercial aftermarket, I recognize you didn't change the full year target. But it sounded like you made a few incrementally cautious comments there, what you said on inventory de-stocking in Europe. Maybe there's a few other incremental positives that you just didn't mention. Traffic's been pretty strong. Year-to-date load factor is still high. So just very simply, would you say on the margin you feel better, worse or the same about commercial aftermarket today versus the last time you spoke to us, and why?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, I think I'd have to say we feel about the same. We reconfirmed the same numbers on our guidance. On the downside, we get some anecdotal evidence, as I said, of some inventory adjustments and frankly, some more kind of hammering in from the European airlines. That's on the downside. On the upside, as I said, the bookings for the quarter were pretty good. So we sort of look at the 2 of them and parse them out, and we don't have a crystal ball and say that feels about the same to us.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Can you tell us -- and I know you don't like to get very granular on pricing, but can you say what the core aftermarket volume growth, so total aftermarket exclusive of price in the quarter, was that positive or negative?","W. Nicholas Howley","You mean do we get positive price?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, I'm asking did you grow aftermarket exclusive of price just on volume?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, we don't -- I'm not going to get -- just frankly, I'm not going to get back into that. I'm not going to get back into figuring out the price from the real volume.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes. No, I mean, I was -- I know you don't want to do that, which is why I was trying to ask just...","W. Nicholas Howley","Which is why you asked it a different way.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And it still didn't work. That's all right.","W. Nicholas Howley","One of these days, it will work.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe I'll try one more then. Just the likelihood that in your view that we see more of these retroactive contract adjustments in the remainder of 2012? I know that can be lumpy.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, let me say I don't know. There's none hanging fire that I know of that will drop in the second half. That being said, we get a lot of LTAs around the ranch, and there's frequently some kind of disputes going on. But I don't know of any right now that I expect to drop in the second half. I would say, as I pointed out, we had this Eaton litigation resolution. It's in our favor with a, not a huge, but a decent award in our favor. There's enough kind of a smoke around that, that we don't -- we're not going to book it yet, but that could clear out in the second half of the year. The smoke could clear, and we could have a positive booking.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen Inc.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to explore the aftermarket comment. You said bookings -- last quarter, I think you said the book to bill was basically EBIT one, but this quarter it's running ahead. So was there something kind of late in the quarter that picked up? And if so, where were you seeing that strength?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, I don't -- let me just look at the last quarter. I don't remember what the last quarter numbers were, but I think that sounds about right. I just don't remember.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I think you said orders were up or about in line with sales but here, we're seeing that they're running ahead. A few months in, so was that a month...","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, I mean the bookings -- as I said, the booking in the second quarter were good. So we're up. We ran ahead of the shipments. We ran ahead of the previous quarter, and we're up above our shipping level on a year-to-date basis. I don't know that I can -- or I mean, excuse me, let me restate that. I can't attribute that to any one thing, but it makes us feel better rather than worse. I would say that to draw much conclusion off a quarter of bookings, it's hard to draw a lot off of that. But it's better to be up than down.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I mean, was there any commonality to the product?","W. Nicholas Howley","No, I can't say there was. We have a lot of different products, and I can't say -- I can't tell you that I could focus it in on fuel systems or interiors or anything like that.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the contract adjustments, could you give us more color on kind of what this was related to? You mentioned there were 2 of them, 2 different contracts...","W. Nicholas Howley","Could you speak up? I couldn't hear the question.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","On the contract adjustments, I think you mentioned there were 2 of them that totaled the $6 million or $5.5 million. Were they different from what you saw last quarter? Were these different contracts? Just a little more color on them?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, what they are, what both of them are, there's a bunch of details that doesn't make all that much difference. Essentially, they are settlements of scope differences on the 787 contracts.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And will that...","W. Nicholas Howley","Each one has some different wrinkles in the exact details. But at the end of the day, their economic impacts have changes in scope as we run through the development process.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And that's what they were last quarter as well?","W. Nicholas Howley","And this quarter.","Gregory Rufus","They're both independent.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, they're independent, by the way. It's not the same contract. They're independent product lines.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But on the 787.","Gregory Rufus","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rama Bondada with Royal Bank of Canada.","R. Rama Bondada - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So kind of going back to Dave's question earlier. When we think about McKechnie, where are we at in the integration time line there in terms of operational integration, pricing changes that you guys normally implement with your newly acquired companies?","W. Nicholas Howley","Ray, why don't you just speak to the integration activities?","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Yes, I can speak to that. Yes, and integration activity was -- this is Ray Laubenthal. The big moves there were to combine our Avtech facility and the Tyee facility, and the Electromech business with McKechnie had multiple units that were being shut down and moved to Mexico. And both of those physical moves have occurred. A lot of activity combining plants, moving plants and so forth. But after you put 2 plants together, there's a settling out period and so forth. And we expect -- and those businesses are settling out as we expect. The temps that we hired to help with the moves and so forth are let go. But the new people hired at the new locations got to come up the learning curve. So the physical pieces, I think that's gone a little bit better than we expected, but that's gone well and that's done for the most part. With the other value creation, the pricing and so forth, we follow the same playbook as we do with every acquisition we buy, and that has moved along as we expected in the commercial aftermarket. And as the OEM LTA contracts expire, we'll work on those as those come up, and there's a few of those to expire in the coming years.","R. Rama Bondada - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So what's the average length of those LTAs that's not...","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Typically in this industry, at least for our products, the LTAs average between 3 and 5 years.","R. Rama Bondada - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it'll be a rolling event that will be occurring over the next couple of years or so?","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Correct.","R. Rama Bondada - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then kind of looking out over the next couple of years, when we think about margins and assuming and obviously, this is a theoretical, so we know that you guys are going to continue doing acquisitions. But if you weren't doing any acquisitions, how quickly do you think you could get back to that 45%, 46% EBIT margins that you guys had before McKechnie?","W. Nicholas Howley","So I don't know what the -- this is Nick. We're conversing with the EBITDA margins, and I think we're about there.","R. Rama Bondada - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So even including AmSafe and Harco and Schneller...","W. Nicholas Howley","No, no, no. Excuse me, excluding those. In the base business with McKechnie, we're about there.","R. Rama Bondada - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley","On the other ones, I would say I -- we'll give a forecast for next year out when we give it, but I would expect the margins would start to move back up.","R. Rama Bondada - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So normally, just because I guess your integration time line with companies, would it be 1 year or 2 years if -- I mean every company's different.","W. Nicholas Howley","We don't -- yes, they're -- all of them are different. We model them over 3 to 5 years. Frequently, we can exceed that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Mr. Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Actually, it's Seth Seifman on for Joe this morning. A question about margins. The performance in the quarter in the base business was quite strong despite an adverse mix shift. I wonder either on a sequential basis or year-on-year if you can quantify the adverse, the margin headwind that came from mix at all or even ballpark?","W. Nicholas Howley","We can't quantify that exactly. What we can make -- as I've told you before, it's unusual for a mix shift period-to-period to move it more than a point or 2.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And as we look out for the rest of the year, you're obviously looking for improvement in the margin and the base business despite the fact that mix could get a little bit tougher with the strong growth in OE. Is there any one particular thing you would point to that's driving that, or it's just a combination of the stuff you usually do?","W. Nicholas Howley","You mean driving the margin increase or driving the mix change?","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Driving the margin improvement...","W. Nicholas Howley","Just the normal stuff. The normal -- we work on the price, we work on the cost every quarter and every year. But there's nothing unusual on that.","Gregory Rufus","Given the operation, it's rare for one event to move margins 1 point. It's just usually going with the tide of everything going on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just the -- I guess follow-up on the margin mix for a second. The EBITDA margin year-on-year, 48% on an adjusted basis. And if I -- thanks for the walk on the gross margin perspective. If I layer that over on to the EBITDA comparison, EBITDA As Adjusted, I'm getting to like a point of dilution from the acquisitions roughly offset by the favorable contract still ending up at about the same EBITDA As Defined margin year-on-year despite the mix. So is there any other thing to think about in terms of what was driving that to get that performance?","W. Nicholas Howley","Myles, I walked you through the EBITDA As Defined, not the gross profit. Was there some confusion?","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Slide 7 walked through the gross profit year-on-year.","Gregory Rufus","Keep going the prior year, year on year. We're just bridging the current year, within it. We don't...","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes, yes.","Gregory Rufus","[indiscernible] prior year and then just with all the acquisitions.","W. Nicholas Howley","You don't have to answer that, Greg. No, Myles, you're asking reconciling versus the prior year?","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","Gregory Rufus","And what we tried to do is give you color for this year because with all the acquisitions, I mean, you could imagine all the puts and takes that go on. So we were just trying to give you color on the current year margin at EBITDA and I wanted to give you a little color on gross profit because we dilute a little more in SG&A with the acquisitions.","W. Nicholas Howley","Let me also add there, Myles, the other -- the thing I was trying to do was to show you if we throw McKechnie into the base, the base is now back at or above where it was before we bought it.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Yes. No, it's more striking to me in terms of just trying to back into the mix apparently not really working against you this quarter and I'm just kind of curious if there's anything we're missing in terms of try to back out to see just what that mix impact may have been.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Yes, I think it is working against us this quarter, which is another way of saying the 50% EBITDA -- or for the quarter, excuse, I talked about year-to-date sorry.","Gregory Rufus","But versus second quarter last year, the mix is working against us.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes.","Gregory Rufus","Our OEM growth was substantial versus our aftermarket.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, right.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I guess on the Slide 7 where it say core business contributed 2 margin points, it seems like the favorable item was about 1.5 points, and then I guess unfavorable versus aftermarket, it had a negative arrow, but I'm just not sure that it actually played out that negatively.","Gregory Rufus","The $6 million, you could do the math on that. That's only about 0.5 margin point there. Given that the aftermarket OEM mix in the quarter was between what 1% and 2%, it was in that range.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. The other question was on cash per quarter. I think maybe it's just rounding, but last quarter you were talking about $80 million a quarter. And I thought I heard $90 million to $100 million, so is that taxes?","Gregory Rufus","No, one, we own another business that we didn't have before, and the other is we tend to be a little conservative on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of J. B. Groh with D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Sort of playing off of Myles' question. How should we think about sort of the -- I know you don't want to give specifics, but the margin differential between aftermarket and OE, I mean I know you're not going to give numbers, but I'm sure it varies by company some -- you're essentially selling a 0 margin to OE and getting massive margins on aftermarket, and then there's a continuum. So with the way the mix was, it seems like there's not that huge gap that maybe we thought that it was. Is that fair?","W. Nicholas Howley","There's a pretty big gap.","Gregory Rufus","A big gap.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then on the -- just a housekeeping item on the contract adjustments, no expenses related to that, right?","Gregory Rufus","That's correct.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then is there any -- I guess you wouldn't have contemplated contract adjustments in the guidance.","Gregory Rufus","No. And as Nick said, I mean, these are the 2 we know about and we don't see anything in the horizon to put in the guidance for the second half.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley","And we didn't have it in the original guidance if that was the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Hugel with Stephens.","Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","When we think about AmSafe, I guess relative to other acquisitions you've done in the past, sort of given the very high sort of aftermarket content, should we think about sort of the margin sort of expansion sort of again sort of accelerating much faster than some -- than prior -- that other acquisitions?","W. Nicholas Howley","I would not. There's some portions of the business that down drag a little, too. That's why I think I said I don't know that this business gets to the average.","Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I know it might not get to the average, but let's say the recovery, your ability to implement pricing is much quicker because it's such higher aftermarket?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. I get your point, but I think we think about these on a 3- to 5-year basis when we sort of give you a sense of what we can do when we buy them, and I think about it the same way and hopefully, you'll be conservative.","Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And in terms of the intangible amortization, because you have that sort of the put and the take of some of the businesses running off, sort of what should we be thinking of in terms of the run rate on a go-forward basis somewhere in the, say, $11 million to $12 million range so we get a full year, a full quarter of AmSafe in there.","W. Nicholas Howley","When we give our guidance out because -- we'll give you a clearer picture because the amortization I gave you or I gave David, I know it does include like backlog amortization and stuff, which is at a more rapid rate. And I just don't have what after the rapid amortization what the run rate is right now. That will come when we do our guidance for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Nick, maybe just to go back to Noah's question, if I look at your commentary from these results with revenue sequentially flat in commercial aftermarket. Last 2 quarters, you talked about them being sequentially flat. So that's 3 quarters in a row of aftermarket sequentially flat. I'm assuming you get a little bit of bump there with 787 and 747 provisioning. So again maybe getting back to that core business, I'm also assuming over the past 9 months there's been some pricing. So it would seem like volumes are under a bit of pressure, I guess?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, let me -- a couple of things. One, we have no provisioning in there. As you know, that's -- we could get some provisioning, and I hope we do. But someday we'll get it, but we have none in the second half. So that -- so I just take issue with that. We're just -- we're not going to back into the pricing this way. So I'm not going to comment on what the real volume is. But I will say I'll just remind you again, the 25% year-over-year growth the year before was, in our judgment, not a sustainable number. So at some point, you're going to give some of that back.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes. No doubt, okay. What about -- I mean, are you seeing anything from any of the string of bankruptcies out there that -- I know you talked about some of the cautious comments and some of the more positive comments. I mean, anything else that would be creating a sequentially flat environment for you guys?","W. Nicholas Howley","Other than just general economic concern, I don't know of anything systematic. The positive is the bookings picked up. Now again, I don't want to over play that, but surely that's a better fact than if they went the other direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Leake with BB&T Capital Markets.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","You gave us sequential commercial aftermarket. Any chance of getting that for Commercial OEM and defense as well sequential?","W. Nicholas Howley","What did we give -- we gave the -- what did we give, Greg? We gave the quarters? Have we given that?","Gregory Rufus","I don't know. I thought we did.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, I thought we did. Obviously we don't have it here.","Gregory Rufus","We don't have them all memorized, sorry. We thought we gave it, but we didn't, I guess.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, biz jet OEM, any color on that? What's driving it? Where are you seeing it? What platform?","W. Nicholas Howley","In what? Was that biz jet?","Gregory Rufus","Biz jet OEM.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, I mean the same story on biz jets that everybody sees. The top of the market is doing better than the bottom of the market. That's the Gulfstream, big Canada air kind of stuff.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Moving to the Eaton settlement. I think the public number we see there is around $8.5 million. Is that correct, what the award is?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, that was offset by a counterclaim, so it's more in the $7 million, $7.5 million range. As I said to start off, there's a couple things there. The big issue there was intellectual property, and we've prevailed completely on that and have all our intellectual property back with an order. The dollar claim, that's going to jostle around. We got some more ongoing prejudgment interest claims. There's an argument about the fees, how much of the back fees do they owe us. And on the other hand, they may appeal some of it. So I don't exactly know where that sorts out.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And where is Eaton right now as far as a customer? Are they still a current customer?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, yes. They're a current customer. They're not in our top 10. I mean, they're a good customer, but they're not one of our big customers.","F. Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Because their counterclaim sort of speaks to underperformance, et cetera, but you don't see -- you see them continuing as a customer relationship.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue, so I will return the call to management for any closing remarks.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. I'd like to thank you, all, for participating on this morning's call, and I'd like to let you know that we expect to file our second quarter 10-Q sometime tomorrow.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Thank you all, that have called in today and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Speaking on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; Chief Operating Officer of our Power Group, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. Replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com. It should be also noted that our Form 10-K will be filed tomorrow and will also be found on our website.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical, in fact, are forward-looking statements.

Today, I'll start off as always; first with some comments about our consistent strategy. Then I'll do an overview of a busy fiscal year 2015. I'll review the initial guidance for fiscal year 2016. Kevin Stein will then review some key operating items for 2015 and Terry will then run through the financials for 2015 and 2016; so, a fair amount to cover here today.","To reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle.","To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, and around three-quarters of our sales come from products for which, we believe, we are the sole source provider, over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales.","Aftermarket sales have historically produced higher gross margins and have provided relative stability in downturns. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has year in and year out generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structuring flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. One, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content.","Second, we have a simple, well proven, value-based operating strategy, based around our three value driver concept; that is steady cost reduction, profitable new business generation, and value-focused pricing. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system with executives and senior management, who think, act and are paid like owners. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to private equity like returns. And fifth, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our effort to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you again, we basically have four choices and our priorities are typically as follows. First, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy, these two are almost always our first choices. Third, give extra capital or funds back to the shareholders, either through special dividends or from times occasionally stock buybacks. Fourth, pay off debt; however given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions.","In the prior year, that is fiscal year 2014, we gave about $1.6 billion back to our shareholders in the form of a large special dividend and some modest stock buyback. This year, that is fiscal year 2015, we saw a number of attractive acquisition opportunities. We acquired about $1.6 billion of proprietary aerospace businesses that met our strategic and shareholder return criteria.","As we've done consistently in the past, depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner we think has the best chance to maximize our equity return.","Fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 were two clear examples of different business environmental situations and two clear differences in how we reacted with the capital allocation. At 9\/30\/2015 or at the just end of this fiscal year, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make about $1.5 billion of acquisition without issuing additional equity.","This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated levels of acquisitions for fiscal year 2016. Interestingly, over the last three years, that is, since the beginning of fiscal year 2013, we have returned about $3.6 billion or almost 50% of the market equity at the start of 2013 to the shareholders. During that timeframe, we also made nine acquisitions for about $2.4 billion, fully supported our existing business and maintained a healthy cash balance and significant dry powder for additional acquisitions.","Now, to summarize fiscal year 2015; 2015 was a busy year. We raised about $2 billion, about half of this was used for acquisitions and the other half was used to decrease the interest rate and to reschedule the payment terms on existing debt.","Second, we acquired six operating units in four different transactions for about $1.6 billion as I mentioned. Thirdly, we continued the integration effort of our various 2014 and 2015 acquisitions. Kevin is going to talk a little more about these. Most importantly, we continued to generate real intrinsic value in our new and existing business and create substantial sustainable shareholder value.","Now, turning to some of the specifics in 2015; to remind you, this is the fourth quarter and full year summary for fiscal year 2015. Our fiscal year ended September 30. As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in mix, timing, inventory fluctuations, et cetera. Total company GAAP revenues were up around 26% versus the prior Q4, and 14% on a full year versus prior full year basis. Organic revenues were up around 4.5% on a Q4 versus prior Q4 basis, and 3% on a full year growth basis.","Reviewing the revenues by market category, and again, this is on a pro forma basis versus prior year Q4 and prior year full year; that is, assuming we owned the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 4% versus the prior Q4 and about 5% on a full year basis. This is primarily driven by commercial transport OEM revenues, which were up about 6% on a full year basis. The commercial transport growth primarily reflects the increase in production rates in the industry.","The bizjet and helicopter revenues were in total slightly down year-over-year, with the business jet up a bit and helicopters down. These segments are small compared to the commercial transport OEM sector. For the fiscal year, total commercial OEM bookings were slightly above shipments.","Moving on to the commercial aftermarket; our commercial aftermarket revenues were up almost 5% for fiscal year 2015 and about the same percentage for the quarter versus the prior quarter. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, commercial transport aftermarket revenues were both up about 5.5%. However, this was partially offset by the smaller bizjet, helicopter and GA aftermarket revenues, which were flat for both periods. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket revenues were up modestly.","For the full fiscal year, bookings were about in line with shipments. In the defense market, which makes up roughly 30% of our revenue; defense revenues for the year were better than we originally anticipated. Fiscal year Q4 revenues were up 12% versus the prior Q4 and 9% on a full fiscal year versus fiscal year basis.","As I mentioned last quarter, the primary drivers of the revenue increase in fiscal 2015 were Airborne Systems, our parachute business, primarily with sales to international customers; the A400M program in a number of our units and the C-130 recovery primarily in our AeroControlex business. On balance, the rest of the defense businesses were relatively flat. Full year defense bookings ran ahead of shipments.","In total, for fiscal year 2015, excluding the acquisitions, our revenues for commercial aftermarket were a bit softer than we originally expected. The commercial OEM was right about on and military revenues were better than we expected. All in all, total revenues were very close to our original expectation.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis, again I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q4 were non-cash compensation expense and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. Our EBITDA As Defined of about $363 million for Q4 was up 25% versus the prior Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA As Defined was $1.23 billion, or up 15% from the prior year. The EBITDA As Defined margins were about 46% of revenue for the full year and 45% for Q4.","The full year margins without dilution from the impact of the acquisitions purchased in 2014 and 2015 was approximately 48%, or up 1.5% versus fiscal year 2014 for the same mix of businesses that we owned going into 2014.","With respect to acquisitions; we continue actively looking at opportunities, the pipeline of near-term possibilities is reasonably active. As I always say, the closings are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Moving on now to the 2016 guidance; as we head into 2016, we have some concerns about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle, we're being cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We could also be a bit conservative on our commercial aftermarket guidance.","Air travel is holding up well. However, in general, publicly reported industry-wide aftermarket revenue trends haven't been particularly encouraging. And we see reports of potential overall economic softening. On balance, these factors tend to make us cautious and hopefully somewhat conservative. But all in all, this is our best estimate; as you know, we'll update this as the year proceeds.","Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions in fiscal year 2016, our guidance is as follows: The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 revenues is $3.1 billion or up about 14% on a GAAP basis year-over-year, organic growth is up about 5% year-over-year. As in the past years, with about 10% less working days, fiscal year 2016 first quarter revenues, EBITDA and EBITDA margins are anticipated to be lower than the other three quarters.","The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined is $1.42 billion or 46% of revenue, that is up 15% year-over-year. This 46% EBITDA margin is in spite of the year-over-year acquisition dilution. We anticipate EBITDA margins will move up through the year as we've seen in previous years. The base business, that's excluding now the 2015 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% in 2016 or up over two points versus 2015. As a result of both our concerns about the duration of the OEM cycle and our lower level of industry-wide design activity, we will reduce our employment levels modestly early in the fiscal year. We will watch our cost and market conditions closely as the year proceeds and react accordingly.","The midpoint of EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $10.45 a share, that's up 16% versus the prior year. This is driven by a significant increase in core operations performance and acquisitions, offset in part by higher interest costs, some taxes, and depreciations and amortizations. Terry will review this in a little more detail.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions; commercial aftermarket growth in the mid-single digit percent to high single digit percent based on worldwide RPM growth in the 5%, maybe plus a little range. We're hopeful there could be some upside here, but we remain cautious due to the factors I discussed earlier. Defense and military revenue is estimated to be up in the low single digit percent versus a very strong 2015. Given world events, there clearly could be variations here in either direction.","Commercial OEM revenue growth; we're guiding to the mid-single digit percent range, primarily due to 2016 and 2017 commercial transport production rates. We're assuming commercial transport unit airframe shipments are up in the low single digit percents for 2016. We are cautious about the 2017 production rates and how this could reflect itself back in the second half of 2016.","Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have almost $1.5 billion in cash and over $500 million in undrawn revolver at the end of 2016. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Again, assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activity, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.8 times EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down around one turn.","In summary, 2015 was a good year. I'm confident with our consistent value-based strategy, our strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our customers.","And now, let me hand this over to Kevin, who will hit some of the highlights from 2015.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fourth quarter and a strong finish to another very busy year. As we have stated previously, we believe our succession planning process, application of TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision, are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we made appreciable progress on each of these this past year.","To this point, let me provide some color to these aspects of our strategy. As we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes an implementation of our value creation process and metrics, restructuring the business into our product line focus groups, focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business. And finally, we tighten up the cost structure.","With nine new units acquired in 2014 and 2015, this integration process was significant. In fiscal year 2014, we acquired three proprietary aerospace businesses in two transactions; Airborne Systems North America, Airborne Systems UK and Elektro-Metall Export, or EME.","All are progressing well and have met our strategic and shareholder return criteria. During 2015, we acquired four businesses, with six different operating units; Telair, Franke, Pexco and PneuDraulics. Telair and Franke were acquired in late March of 2015. At Telair, the business at acquisition was divided into three operational units. The three operational units have become Telair US Cargo Systems based in Goldsboro, North Carolina; Nordisk Aviation Products based in Norway; and Telair International based in Miesbach, Germany.","We believe keeping these as separate business units will allow improved focus and accountability driving value creation. Each of these businesses made progress, integrating the TransDigm operating model and value generation philosophy. The first phase of productivity restructuring has been completed across all three operating units, including head count reductions and non-core facility closures.","In addition, Neal McKeever, an experienced TransDigm leader, was added as President of Nordisk Aviation. Although, still early in the process, this collection of aerospace cargo-related manufacturers have met or surpassed our expectations. As a whole, we do not expect this group of businesses to achieve TransDigm average margins within the next three years to four years due to long-term contracts in place and other factors. However, we have seen improvements in all three businesses in EBITDA as a percent of sales and we certainly expect to see more.","Franke was an acquisition of an aviation faucet business and is in the throes of being relocated from its home base in Germany to our operations at Adams Rite Aerospace in Southern California. Once complete, this product line will be married to our existing Adams Rite faucet business, which will allow us to leverage the greater than 30 years of design and manufacturing of lavatory components for use in commercial transport applications.","In May of 2015, we acquired Pexco, a custom plastics extrusion company, headquartered in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used in the galleys, lavatories, floors, ceiling and stowage bins of aircraft. Although, a performing business at acquisition, we have still found opportunity to apply the TransDigm value drivers in this business.","This includes head count reductions and the closure and relocation of the Huntington Beach operations to Yakima, Washington. To assist in the integration of this business into TransDigm, we have relocated Herb Mardany, an experienced President, who has been developed from a previous acquisition and most recently as the President of AvtechTyee into this business.","In August of 2015, we finalized the acquisition of PneuDraulics into the TransDigm family. Obviously, it is very early in our integration process, but by all indications, this commercial aerospace hydraulic actuation business is a fit for our portfolio. Cost reduction efforts are currently being implemented through early 2016 and our focus will now move to the implementation of the rest of our TransDigm value drivers around profitable new business and value pricing. Early feedback should have this business achieving TransDigm like EBITDA margins in the long-term.","Let me now touch on the results of our succession planning process and how we are developing bench strength for future growth. We currently operate with approximately 31 business units and 8,200 employees. Given the size and scope of TransDigm today, additional executive vice presidents were needed for growth and succession purposes. Each EVP has responsibility for five business units to six business units and $200 million to $300 million of EBITDA. These executives are responsible for ensuring each group of businesses stay well-grounded in the TransDigm value drivers and culture.","To accomplish this, we have recently promoted two experienced TransDigm executives as executive vice presidents to handle our ever expanding portfolio. They have both been with TransDigm for over 15 years and have had a range of functional and senior management assignments. Roger Jones, previous President of AeroControlex and CEF Aerospace; and Joel Reiss, previous President of Skurka Aerospace and Hartwell Corporation, are these key new additions to our senior management team and ensure we continue to groom and grow our talent to fulfill our future needs. Finally, I wanted to bring your attention to an impressive award TransDigm recently won. In August of this year, Forbes announced that TransDigm had been named to their list of The World's Most Innovative Companies. This award identifies TransDigm as one of the top 100 global companies in innovation, and the only aerospace company so recognized; clearly, a validation of our strategy and our ability to generate shareholder value.","Examples of this type of innovation can be found in a number of businesses. For Schneller, a global leader in highly engineered decorative solutions for the transportation industry, this year, they won a large award from a major global airline for a complete fleet rebranding campaign, including color, look and feel. This will include a refresh of the galleys, lavatories, cabins, floors and seating areas.","At Hartwell Corporation, they were awarded the 737 MAX thrust reverser latch package of significant value at full production rate with initial design unit shipped to the customer with production requirements shipping later this fiscal year. Additionally, Hartwell was awarded the A330neo thrust reverser and fan color latch packages. One of these latches is a derivative of a recently developed latch in support of Airbus to address fan color loss prevention on the A320 current engine option fleet.","Champion Aerospace and United Technologies Corporation announced jointly that they have finalized a Life of Program supply agreement for to support production at UTC's aerospace businesses. Ignition components include exciters, ignition leads and igniters. Champion has now been positioned as the sole source provider of these ignition systems and components on the entire PurePower family of engines powering platforms, such as the Airbus A320neo, Embraer E-Jets E2, Mitsubishi MRJ, and the Gulfstream G500 and G600. AvtechTyee recently developed two new communications products for commercial aerospace. First is a redesigned audio control panel for the 737 platform, which provides improved reliability and decreased maintenance in the cockpit. This sealed audio control panel is gaining traction in both the OEM and aftermarket.","Additionally, AvtechTyee recently won business with a number of airlines for a 737 MAX and 777 applications for a newly designed radio, the SELCAL or selective-calling radio, which is in essence, a pager in the sky that allows the pilots to activate their radio when needed to avoid constant listening to static and squawk on the radio, eliminating a key source of pilot fatigue.","These are just a small sample of the new business wins from the past year, and with that let me now hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key events that occurred in fiscal year 2015. So, I'll now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter; then give a brief fiscal year end summary.","Fourth quarter net sales were $810 million, up $168 million or approximately 26% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions; Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics and Franke, contributed over 80% of the additional sales for the period. Our organic sales were approximately 4.5% higher than last year, primarily driven by growth in defense, partially offset by lower growth rates in commercial OEM and aftermarket.","Our fourth quarter gross profit was $428 million or 52.8% of sales. Our reported gross profit margin of 52.8% was 1.5 margin points lower than prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of almost three margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved almost 1.5 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.1% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.9% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock comp, SG&A was about 10.2% of sales compared to 10.9% of sales a year ago.","We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $16 million versus the prior year quarter. This was the result of an increase of outstanding borrowings of $950 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was to fund acquisitions.","Our net income for the quarter increased $27 million or 24% to $142 million, which is 17.5% of sales. This compares to net income of $114 million or 17.8% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales versus the prior period, partially offset by higher interest expense and higher acquisition-related costs.","GAAP EPS was $2.50 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.91 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.83 per share, an increase of 28% compared to $2.21 per share last year. Please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Since this is our fiscal year end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some significant items. Net sales increased $334 million or by 14% to end our year at $2.7 billion in revenue.","Acquisitions contributed just over 75% of the increase in sales, organic sales were about 3% above prior year. Reported gross profit increased 14% to $1.45 billion and was 53.6% of sales compared to 53.4% in prior year. Excluding all acquisition activity and stock comp expense, our full year margin versus prior year improved 1.5 margin points.","Selling and administrative expenses of 11.9% of sales in fiscal year 2015 is slightly higher than the 11.7% of sales in fiscal year 2014. Again, excluding all acquisition-related expenses, stock compensation and non-operating expenses, SG&A was about 10.3% of sales compared to 10.4% of sales last year.","Net interest expense increased $71 million due to the increase in the weighted average outstanding borrowings to $7.8 billion from $6.3 billion last year. Our fiscal year 2015 weighted average interest rate was 5.2%. Our effective tax rate for the year was 29.8% for fiscal year 2015, compared to 31.6% for fiscal year 2014.","The lower current year tax rate was primarily due to recognizing the benefit from the utilization of foreign tax credits, foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates, as well as favorable discrete adjustments related to the finalization of prior year IRS audits. Adjusted EPS was $9.01 per share this year, up 16% from $7.76 per share a year ago.","Now, switching gears to cash and liquidity; the company generated $521 million of cash from operating activities and we closed the year with $714 million of cash on the balance sheet. The company's gross debt leverage ratio at September 30, 2015, was approximately 6.4 times pro forma EBITDA and 5.9 times pro forma EBITDA on a net basis.","We believe fiscal year 2015 was another great year for TransDigm and our shareholders. As we look forward to fiscal year 2016, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP EPS to be $9.32 and as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $10.45.","As we disclosed on slide nine, there is $1.13 in adjustments to bridge GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. In addition, here are a few other fiscal year 2016 assumptions. Depreciation and amortization including backlog amortization of approximately $14 million is expected to be approximately $118 million compared to approximately $94 million in fiscal year 2015.","Interest expense is expected to increase 7% to around $450 million in fiscal year 2016. As we discussed on the last call, 75% of our debt is fixed, swapped or capped. For the next four years or five years, we are reasonably hedged against large swings in interest rates. Given our current structure, a large increase in the LIBOR rate of 8%, far above what anybody is anticipating, would increase our after-tax interest rate by 1.25%. In essence, we have approximately $15 million after-tax interest expense sensitivity to every 1% change in the LIBOR rate.","Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 is expected to be 31% and our cash taxes to be approximately $200 million. We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will increase slightly and be approximately 56.8 million shares. As a result of these items, our adjusted EPS of $10.45 is approximately 16% greater than fiscal year 2015.","Finally, with regards to our liquidity and leverage, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transaction, we expect to have almost $1.5 billion of cash on hand at the end of fiscal year 2016. Again, as Nick mentioned, assuming no acquisition activity, our net leverage ratio will be 4.8 times our EBITDA As Defined at September 30, 2016, or deleveraging a little over a full turn.","I will now hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A session.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terry. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli, KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys; a real nice quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe, Nick, you talked about concerns on the OE cycle more pronounced into 2017. Can you just elaborate are you looking at specific platforms there or are you looking at your exposure to the 777 or maybe just kind of expand on what's giving you the specific concerns?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. I can't \u2013 I mean, you know, guys, I know all \u2013 I hear all the announcements on potential production cuts or up or down as you guys do; so I know nothing unique there. I would say it's more of a general concern. You know, we have an expansion that's been going on now for 11 years or something like that. It's generally forecast to run another three years, four years, pick the person, that's getting up in the 14-year, 15-year range, that's started to look awful long in the tooth to me.","I can't give you a specific. I understand the backlogs in place still look pretty good, but that's starting to look pretty long to me and something that bears watching and when I combine that with the fact that you see a lot of noise in press releases now around the worldwide economy and the U.S. economy softening a bit. The combination of those two things concerns me. It's not any specific insight different than any you have. We are roughly market weighted on the airplane. So there is no one airplane that's going to drastically knock us out of \u2013 that's going to significantly change our numbers versus others.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then just maybe one last one for me, just broadly on the commercial aerospace aftermarket; can you give us an update on kind of what you're seeing from airline behavior? And if we look at suppliers out there, I mean there continues to be wide variations of reported growth with, I guess, GE and Safran leading the way, UTX and Pratt kind of lagging; how do you guys tend to correlate with those suppliers and maybe what you are seeing?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, I don't know. On the engine, guys, I frankly don't know how to correlate that. I'm sure all of you watch them too. It seems to me, they swing up and down all over the place. They go up fast and down fast and I don't know how to correlate them with us. We tend to correlate ourselves more with the \u2013 with the more componenty kind of people, you know, that you see, UTAS and Honeywell and people like that. I think we're probably running a little ahead of those kind of businesses.","I'd say in the marketplace, it still seems to me, as though they should be ordering more, or taking more. And that's why I've said, I think there is some upside in next year's number. But when you see the numbers and you see the discussion in the economy and the numbers other people are turning in and talking about it, it gives you some concern about being overly bullish.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, guys, I'll jump back into queue.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna, Cowen and Co. Please proceed.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning and great results.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Wanted to just have you elaborate on what you're seeing on the defense side of the business, aftermarket NOE (40:26) and if there's any tough comps we should be mindful of as we look through fiscal 2016? I remember the Airborne Systems piece had a bit of a comeback. So, how should we think about sort of the...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, I think, you mean as far as quarters or something like that?","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, well, first, we don't give quarterly guidance. I think you just have to look at the guidance we gave for the year. The specific things that moved it up are the parachute business, as we said, the international orders and those still look pretty strong. The Airbus 400 have a fair amount of a lot of activity, a lot of it being sort of catch-up for backed up stuff. That I think doesn't \u2013 you don't get a lot of growth off of that, just because it spiked up pretty well. The C-130, which we caught up a fair amount due to inventory drawdown at Lockheed and AeroControlex, I think that's kind of at rate, but I don't think the C-130 \u2013 the rates aren't going up on the C-130. I think you probably saw the catch-up you see there. And the combination of all those is why we're \u2013 we're not expecting another, whatever, at 9% to 12% growth next year.","Now, I will admit, the defense business, it's an uncertain world out there. It could move down. I think it could move up too.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And that's helpful...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think the chances of the OEM portion of the business, which is less than the majority of the business moving dramatically from what we expect is small. Where you can get the movement is if operating tempo picks up, they start buying more spares and repairs.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's fair. Thank you, Nick. And I was wondering if you could also just comment on your balance sheet capacity for a special dividend versus M&A in this environment. We did see some perturbations in the high yield market during the quarter, and I just wondered what you think you could actually lever up to for either a special or a corporate acquisition?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I hesitate to guess at that, only because we see the same thing you see. It's sort of bouncing around, though I think yesterday, our bonds were trading just about at par. But it's kind of moved around a bit.","Let me just see; our credit agreement is public, right?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Our credit agreement, yes, it is.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","As you know, our credit agreement allows us to go up to 7.25% net. I think it might be tough in today's environment to get up to 7.25% net. I'm not sure we couldn't do it, the question is, whether we want to do it with the price movement it would take. We are thinking more like sort of 7%-s around our limit rather than 7.25%. Which I don't... (43:23)","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","And that would be for M&A or...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're probably a little more cautious around that mark with that now than we were a year ago.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think in either case...","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","...for dividends, would it be lower or would it be...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, and well, probably a little bit; it's hard to get an exact beat on that until you go out and try and raise it, but probably a little lower.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co.

Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Nick, just looking at your revenue forecast, I'm having a hard time reconciling mid-single digit organic growth plus you've got, it looks like, about 2.5 full quarters of additional acquired revenues from all the deals you've done recently. Is it truly 5% organic you're assuming, because I'm just having a hard time getting down to kind of where you're guiding revenues to?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We gave you the number. I don't follow you, David. The number is not clear or when you add acquisitions...","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Well, yes, if you take 5% organic revenue growth plus basically 2.5 additional quarters of about the similar amount of acquired revenues you had this quarter, you come up with a fair amount higher than the top end of your range.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we're somehow disconnected maybe on our definition of organic.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","David, I just don't know, but I suspect we may be calculating organic different than you're calculating. But it's hard for me to answer that without seeing the calculation, but I think, Liza, we'd be glad to look at it.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes (45:08).","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, all right. That's fine. I can take it offline.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","And then, you gave us a lot of data around what you're assuming for kind of base business margins and all of that. If you look at your adjusted EBITDA growth, Nick, of 15% that you're guiding to for next year, how does that break out between base business and acquired, the acquisitions in terms of that 15%?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, I mean, it always is a \u2013 you're going to get a reasonable slug of it out of acquisitions, because they're new and you've got them for a full year. We don't break that number out, mostly because we don't want to go make judgments on allocations of overhead and things like that on it. But the new ones are a pretty good contributor. The existing businesses, you're not going to get the kind of margin movement you see in a new one.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, then historically, we've always increased the margins on these existing businesses, and we'll continue to do that on these acquired businesses. So we expect it to move on.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And last one for me, did I hear correctly $1.5 billion in ending cash at 2016, so are you implying, as we think about free cash flow somewhere in the $700 million to $800 million range next year?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, I think what we said was almost $1.5 billion, and I think with what we're expecting midpoint on EBITDA and our cash conversion rate of that EBITDA, that puts you in the right range of what you're mentioning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But the answer to the question is yes.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on Dave's last question, first. So, you usually get about $100 million of cash from financing activity from the options and excess tax benefits. So the free cash flow would be somewhere in the $600 million to $700 million as opposed to $700 million to $800 million, is that right?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I guess it depends how you define free cash flow. We define free cash flow as operating cash minus CapEx. And the way we look at the business is we really look at EBITDA conversion after paying cash taxes, interest, and working capital and that we see that's always over 50% and that's what we target.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay, to follow up on that one...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But the math is just $750 million and goes to a little under $1.5 billion.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","$1 billion to $1.5 billion.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You can do the math on the free cash flow.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. But, you would pick up some extra cash in financing is all I was getting at from the options.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, because the exercise of the options.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. So, to back up, for 2015, so, you target 50% conversion of adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow, it didn't play out in 2015. Was it simply cash taxes in the flow of those in the course...","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, I think and believe it did pay out. I think the number, we look at free cash flow of $521 million, back off $55 million, we're \u2013 or, excuse me, our EBITDA of $1.2 billion, converted after interest and cash tax and CapEx, were almost 53% conversion.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Your EBITDA As Defined was $1,233 million.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, that's what \u2013 yes, so, we have...","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You have operating cash flow of $521 million.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, but again, as I mentioned, we look at it as, take your EBITDA, back off cash interest and cash tax. The other piece of it is working capital, that you're factoring in your free cash and you can see from a working capital, we've made some investments this year.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think, you're just trying to calibrate them. Miles, when we say it's over 50%, there is a definition of what we mean by that.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We mean, what we call operating, which is EBITDA minus cash interest minus cash tax minus CapEx, right.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, got it. Because in prior years, the working capital actually has not been a source, it's been more of a \u2013 excuse me, not been a use, it has been more of a source, so, I guess that's the differential this year.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. You heard Kevin talk about, as we move to integrating some of these new businesses, and growing our businesses, we built some working capital in the inventory area this year and that's what you're seeing.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And the only other one that I had was, the 31% as a starting point for tax, is that a good ongoing rate beyond 2016, is there anything one-off in 2016 that's helping drive down...","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, we don't predict what the discretes will be. That is our estimate for our full year effective tax rate. So the 31% is that number. And it's down from 33%, where we started last year, because of the Telair acquisition structure we put in place.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, yes. That's the recurring rate.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert, Canaccord. Please proceed.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I just wanted to follow up on that working capital question if I could. Was almost all of the growth, it looks like about half was inventory this year and then some on the accounts receivable. Was that all associated with the acquisitions and positioning them or was there anything else going on in the base business?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, I don't believe there's anything going on in the base business. It's really driven by acquisitions. If we look at our DSOs, they're very consistent year-over-year as well as from an inventory turn, the same thing. The acquisitions as well as we are building up a little bit of safety stock...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And volumes have gone up.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And volumes have gone up, absolutely.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes. And then \u2013 okay. So as you think about 2016 and the guidance I guess, a lot of that is helped I guess into 2016 when you think about at least some of the inventory and the ability to sort of work that down through the year?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think that's, we'll see how that all plays out. I think one thing we have to recognize is that we really are focusing on EBITDA and we are willing to give up a little bit of working capital to generate further EBITDA. So that's really our strategy.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I think as far as looking at the basic business model, what we define as working capital is receivables and inventory minus accounts payable, that's what we track. That number runs 27%-ish, 26% to 28%, and it doesn't change much, and any change you see in there from year-to-year is just a random perturbation. You can use that number and feel pretty comfortable that it's a pretty good predictor, that kind of range. As percent of revenue, I'm talking about.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes, yes. Okay, no, that's helpful.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's what we use when we model it.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, okay. That's helpful. So I guess the only variability would be obviously incremental acquisitions which obviously are not in the guides.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","And if I could just finally, Nick, on the aftermarket, I know last time we spoke you were commenting around still some inventory in, not at the distribution level, but at the airline level. Do you see that as \u2013 is that part of your conservatism here in 2016, and how that plays out or you get a sense that specific inventory levels are close to normalized and the caution around the guidance is really just, obviously 2015 had a lot of surprises maybe and obviously you don't want to get too far ahead of things here?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, first, I have no specific way to exactly put my finger on what the inventory is that all the airlines have. I would say they seem to be buying less than they should be consuming and I don't think we are alone in saying that. I think there is some probability or if not possibility, that there were overbuys before that that are being drawn down, and I think there is some possibility that they're getting a little better on inventory management.","All those combined with the fact that some economic concern is what has us a little softer. But you know, you take our guidance for aftermarket, take off the price and you can make whatever estimate you want on that, you guys probably won't be too far off. You'll see, we're still pretty modest in our assumptions on the real growth, the unit growth, it probably still doesn't track airline activity.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes, exactly. Well obviously coming off of 2015, that's probably a fair assumption, a safe assumption heading into 2016?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. But we hope there could be upside there.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yes.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We'd love to be wrong on the upside.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS. Please proceed.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Nick, back on the aftermarket; any distinction on what you're seeing in terms of kind of the more discretionary part of the aftermarket versus the non-discretionary part?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think I can realistically make that argument. If I look quarter-by-quarter, it's spotty across the businesses that are discretionary and non-discretionary. The vast majority of our businesses are not discretionary stuff. You just need them when you run the hours and I can't say there is a marked difference in the more discretionary things.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And, Terry, the gap, the difference between the adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS guidance; can you reconcile how much of that is stock comp versus acquisition or integration-related cost?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, I think it's in the slides, David. I think if you looked at slide nine, you will see that the biggest component there is the non-cash stock comp of about $0.64 and then acquisition related expenses of $0.44 that makes up $1.13.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Yes. Okay, haven't seen that. Thanks.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys, and nice numbers as always, Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Couple of questions; first off, just on the order trends, Nick, when you look regionally I think real-time, do you see any difference in order activity out of some of the places that we're all worried about, whether it's Asia or Middle East or Latin America; you're spread across those places, is there anything to note in terms of order differentials on the aftermarket?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Nothing that I feel comfortable enough to talk about, Carter. I don't see any particular conclusion I can draw other than the normal; people are flying more and buying more. But I can't say I see any dislocation in one place different than another at least on the data we have.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. And then just a quick follow-up, you mentioned really quickly the head count reduction; I wondered if you might kind of compare that to \u2013 obviously you did one in \u2013 I believe it was 2008. Is this something like that in terms of a magnitude or presumably it's a bit smaller and maybe you can give us just some color on?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Smaller. Yes, it's smaller. I mean, it's more in the low single digit kind of percents.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Than the 10% you did?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, yes, yes, and the logic there is as I think I told you we're a little concerned about the length of the cycle and in fact anything that happens in 2017 will start to ripple back into 2016. As you know quite quickly and the overall economic news across the whole economy doesn't look great to us. And you combine that with the fact that there isn't quite as much development activity as there was three years ago or four years ago.","Our view also, Carter, as you know, is to get out ahead of that stuff. We're not ready to make a sort of a definitive statement or an adjustment as we did back then, but we'll keep watching that very closely and we quickly will, if our view changes.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So you think this is more engineering and overhead-oriented at least, at first?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Impacted by \u2013 yes. We primarily are making adjustments in the non-hourly, though we're adjusting some of the hourly. The bigger adjustments are in the non-hourly, and the reason for that is, we've still got the backlog. So I mean we're still cranking stuff out, just like the production rates are cranking out. But that almost naturally take care of itself, if the backlog starts to soften at all. Where you have to get proactive is in all the overhead structure. And we're sort of getting a little ahead of that.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Makes perfect sense.

My name is Cathy, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Liza Sabol of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Liza Sabol","Good morning, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Ray Laubenthal; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus.","The company would like to remind you that statements made during this call which are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC, available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, let me please now turn the call over to Nick.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Good morning, and thanks again for calling in to hear about the company. Today, as usual, I'll start off with some comments about our consistent strategy, an update on the capital allocation activities in the last quarter, an overview of the financial performance and a market summary from Q3 and an update on our full year guidance.","Just to restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle.","To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, and around 3\/4 of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Over 1\/2 of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales and revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability in the downturns. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated strong free cash flow.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value driver concepts. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system, with operating unit executives and officers who think, act and are paid like owners. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as another means to create shareholder value. We have been, in the past and continue to be, willing to lever up when we either see good opportunities or view our leverage as suboptimum for value creation.","As I mentioned last quarter, we continually look at our likely needs for acquisition and internal investment, cash and\/or debt capacity, as well as the capital market situations, all in context of our near and midterm needs and outlook. The Q3 credit market situation was uniquely favorable by most historical standards. From any longer-term perspective, the after-tax cost of debt capital was low, especially when compared to our stated equity return goals. In light of these market conditions, we accelerated our capital allocation calls for this year.","In Q3, we borrowed about $3.4 billion, almost 1\/2 of which was used to pay a special $25 a share dividend. Most of the balance was used to refinance our existing 7.75% bonds, with lower interest costs and extended maturity. We kept a modest portion of the proceeds for general corporate purposes, one of which has been to buy about $75 million of our existing shares. We may well buy additional shares over the next few months.","After completion of the financing, our weighted interest rate will be about 5.3% per year, including the cost of forward interest rate hedges. This is down from about 5.7% interest prior to the recent financing. Our actual rate starts lower than 5.3% but will move up to 5.3% as the hedges kick in. Our net leverage as of 06\/28\/2014 is now 6.4x EBITDA. About 50% of our debt is fixed and another 20% is forward hedged, beginning in 2015. Our maturities have been extended. We increased the size of our revolver, and the credit terms were favorably modified. All in all, we think this is a pretty good outcome.","At the end of our third quarter, based on the current capital market conditions and our new credit agreement, we believe we have adequate liquidity capacity to make about $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity. This includes around $730 million of cash. This capacity continues to grow each quarter. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for fiscal year '14 or '15. Overall, through our consistent focus on our operating value drivers, our very clear acquisition strategy and close attention to our capital allocation, we have been able to create intrinsic value for our shareholders for many years, through up and down markets, and we anticipate continuing to do so in the future.","Now with respect to the commercial aftermarket status, next quarter, unless there is an unusual situation, I'll probably stop separately highlighting this, as I've been doing in the recent quarters. We have been seeing a market recovery for the last 3 to 4 quarters, and this has continued into Q3 of fiscal year 2014. The third quarter of fiscal year 2014 commercial aftermarket revenues on a same-store basis were up almost 15% versus the prior Q3 and are up about 9.5% on a 9-month year-to-date basis. Just as an aside, we have seen minimal 787 provisioning orders on our revenues at this point.","Our bookings or incoming orders are running about 6% ahead of revenues on a year-to-date basis, and they're up about 14% versus the prior 9-month year-to-date bookings. As I have said, the aftermarket recovery may not be linear. There could be quarterly ups and downs. Our data now indicates even more strongly that the market is expanding. If the worldwide economy holds up, we would expect this to continue, though I do want to point out the rate of increase may slow down over the next few quarters.","Turning to our Q3 2014 performance. I remind you this is the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. Our fiscal year began October 1 of 2013. And as I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by OEM aftermarket mix, large orders, inventory fluctuations and the like. The third quarter of fiscal year '14 was a good quarter for TransDigm. Our GAAP revenues were up about 25% versus both -- the prior year Q3. On a year-to-date basis, the bookings continue to run ahead of revenues.","Reviewing the revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus prior Q3. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 6% versus the prior Q3 and about 9% on a year-to-date basis. This is primarily driven by commercial transport OEM revenues, which were up 12% on a year-to-date basis. Business jet revenues are only up about 3%. Total commercial aftermarket revenue comps, as I said before, they were up about 15% versus the prior Q3, and they're also up about 8% sequentially.","The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenue. The defense picture in Q3 was mixed. For Q3, the total defense revenues were down 7% versus the prior third quarter and about flat on a year-to-date basis. This number now includes the Airborne parachute business revenues, which are more lumpy than our base business. Without Airborne, our underlying defense revenues are down 2% versus the prior Q3 and up 5% year-to-date.","The Airborne parachute bookings picked up substantially in Q3 versus the first half of the year due to 2 large U.S. military orders. The total defense bookings were strong in Q3, and year-to-date, they are running about 6% ahead of shipments in spite of delays in certain large international parachute orders. In our other businesses, we've seen good order activity from both domestic and international military buyers. We do remain cautious about the military markets.","Moving along to profitability now. And on a reported basis, I am going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q3 were primarily due to refinancing-related costs and noncash stock option expense. Our EBITDA As Defined of about $276 million for Q3 was up 19% versus the prior year Q3, and our year-to-date of $782 million is up about 20% versus the prior year.","The EBITDA margin was about 45% of revenues on a year-to-date basis and roughly the same in Q3. The Q3 margin was reduced by over 2% by the inclusion of Airborne and EME acquisitions. Our base business EBITDA margins, that is, excluding Airborne, EME and the 3 we bought in June of last year, was about 48% on a year-to-date basis. This is up 1% versus the prior year for that same group of businesses.","With respect to acquisitions, we've completed about $300 million of acquisitions so far this year. We continue to look at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is reasonably active with about the same mix of sizes as usual. We are seeing more European activity than we have seen in the past. The closings are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunity that meet our tight criteria.","Moving on now to the 2014 guidance. The military market is still spotty and we think, hard to predict. The rate of recovery in the commercial aftermarket is proceeding, and the commercial OEM is roughly on track. The underlying EBITDA margins are running slightly ahead. Based on the above and assuming no additional 2014 acquisitions, our guidance is revised as follows: The midpoint of the revised guidance is now $2.36 billion or up $15 million versus the prior midpoint. The revenue increase is primarily due to a modest improvement in the commercial aftermarket full year outlook.","The midpoint of the revised 2014 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now $1.07 billion or 45.3% of revenues, up $10 million from the prior quarter guidance. This margin includes 1.5% to 2% of dilution from Airborne and EME. The dollar increase in EBITDA is primarily due to the commercial aftermarket mentioned in the revenues. We are anticipating our base businesses, again, excluding Airborne, EME and the 2013 June acquisitions, to run at about 48% for the year.","The midpoint of EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $7.52 per share versus a prior guidance of $7.58. The range on this is plus or minus about $0.05 a share. The change is primarily due to the improved operating performance and some lower tax expenses more than offset by the higher interest expense from the recent financing and special dividend.","At the midpoint, our 2014 guidance is based on the commercial OEM and defense revenue outlooks remaining unchanged from both last quarter and our initial guidance. The commercial aftermarket on a same-store basis is now assumed to be up slightly over 10% on a full year basis. This was corrected on the slides we originally sent out this morning.","In summary, the first 3 quarters are modestly ahead of our initial expectations. Hopefully, these strengthening market conditions continue. But in any event, I'm confident, with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic shareholder value for our investors.","With that, let me hand it over to Greg, who will discuss the financial results.","Gregory Rufus","Thanks, Nick and good morning again. I'd first want to remind you, and as Nick mentioned, we raised $3.4 billion during the quarter, primarily to pay the $25 per share special dividend and refinance $1.6 billion of the notes that were due 2018. This activity impacted several line items significantly in the quarter. With that in mind, I'd like to expand on a few items included in our quarterly financial results.","Please reference Slide 7 in this morning's deck. Sales were $611 million, 25% greater than the prior year. Our organic sales was 7% higher than last year, driven primarily by the growth in commercial aftermarket and to a lesser extent, commercial OEM. This growth was partially offset by a modest decline in the defense sales.","Third quarter gross profit was $328 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year. The reported gross profit margin of 53.6% was 1.4 margin points less than the prior year. This quarter's margins were negatively impacted by the current year acquisitions of Airborne and EME and the acquisitions of Arkwin, Whippany and Aerosonic made in the prior year. The dilutive impact from acquisition mix and the acquisition-related costs was almost 3.5 margin points at the gross profit line. The prior year gross profit margin was also diluted approximately 1 margin point for noncash stock compensation expense due to the acceleration of certain stock options that did not repeat in fiscal '14.","Excluding all the acquisition activity and stock compensation expense, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved almost 1 margin point. We have the benefit of favorable OEM and aftermarket mix, and the base businesses continued to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure.","Selling and administrative expenses were 11.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 16.9% in the prior year. The majority of the decrease in SG&A was related to lower noncash stock compensation costs in the current period. Stock compensation expense as a percent of sales was about 1% compared to 5.5% in the prior period. The prior period also included higher acquisition-related expenses. Excluding noncash stock compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, SG&A was about 10.5% of sales in both periods.","Interest expense was $88 million, an increase of approximately $25 million or 40% versus the prior year quarter. This is a result of a 43% increase in the weighted average total debt to $6.2 billion in the current quarter versus $4.3 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was due to the recent financing just discussed and the July 2013 financing associated with last year's $22 special dividend. As a result of our recent financing, our weighted average cash interest rate has decreased to 4.9% compared to 5.5% in the prior year. Including the newly incurred debt, we now expect our full fiscal 2014 net interest expense to be approximately $348 million.","Onetime refinancing costs of $131 million were booked in the current period in conjunction with June's financing. $120 million of the costs were the premium to redeem the 7.75% notes and $10 million were for the writing off of debt issue costs. Our effective tax rate was 22.5% in the current period compared to 32.9% in the prior year. The current quarter rate was due to favorable foreign tax credits realized in our recently filed federal income tax return. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be around 33% and our cash taxes to be approximately $125 million.","Our net income for the quarter decreased $60 million or 79% to $16 million, which is 3% of sales. This compares to net income of $77 million in the prior year. The decrease in net income primarily reflects the onetime refinancing costs just mentioned and higher interest expense, partially offset by growth in net sales and lower noncash stock compensation costs.","As I've discussed in the past, our EPS is calculated under the 2-class method versus the more commonly used treasury method. We are required to use this method because of our dividend equivalent program. As you could see on Tables 1 and 3 of this morning's press release, our GAAP loss per share was $1.66 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.71 income per share last year. You may be wondering how do we have positive net income but a GAAP loss per share. The loss per share was due to the inclusion of approximately $111 million or $1.94 per share of dividend equivalent payments paid in the current quarter primarily related to the $25 per share dividend. This compares to the $0.70 per share paid in the prior period. Please reference Slide 11 of this morning's earnings call, which shows all the details.","Our adjusted earnings per share was $2.02 per share, an increase of 7% compared $1.89 last year. The 7% increase is lower than the 12% increase in adjusted net income due to the higher weighted average shares in the current period, resulting from the accelerated stock option vesting that occurred primarily in 2013. Note this dilution will be slightly offset going forward due to the purchase of approximately 420,000 shares of treasury stock in the current quarter. We now expect our weighted average shares to be 57 million for the full fiscal year of 2014. Again, please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles the GAAP to the adjusted earnings per share.","As Nick previously mentioned, the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share decreased $0.06 to $7.52 per share. The increase in interest expense had a negative impact of $0.25 per share. This negative impact was offset by the following 3 items: favorable operating results which contributed $0.11 per share, a lower effective tax rate which contributed $0.06 per share and the decrease in the weighted average shares were $0.02 per share.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $729 million of cash on the balance sheet. This includes the completion of the financing, net of the $25 per share dividend and related DEP payments, the repayment of the 7.75% notes and the related fees and the purchase of approximately $75 million of treasury stock. The company's net debt leverage ratio was 6.4x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined. We now expect to end the year with approximately $850 million of cash on the balance sheet, assuming no other acquisition activity. Absent any further changes to our capital structure or any stock repurchase, we expect our net debt leverage ratio to be 6.1x EBITDA As Defined by the end of the year.","Now I'll hand it back over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question which comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Nick, looking at your revised guidance for the full year, it seems like you're implying Q4 about sequentially flat in terms of sales and adjusted EBITDA margins. When we see the adjusted EBITDA margins potentially move up with another strong aftermarket quarter and the acquisitions being there for another quarter, why wouldn't we see those margins...","Walter Nicholas Howley","Just a sec, we're looking it up. I didn't think that was the case, so let me just look it up. Where's -- yes, it's gone up a little. Yes, it's gone up about 0.5 point, I think. I think you're talking about 0.5 point, if we're doing the math, and you're right. But I get your point. We -- about 0.5 point is what we got cranked in there. It's probably getting lost in the abouts.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Yes, it looks about -- it looks relatively flat to me, but it might be in the noise. On the aftermarket, could you just talk a little bit about -- I don't know if you specifically said, I may have missed it, what bookings were like in the quarter sequentially. And where did you see the improvement? Was it more on the discretionary kind of aftermarket side? Or really, what drove the improvement there?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. I would say it was -- we're sequentially up 8%. The -- it is -- we are clearly seeing -- whether it's the business or whether it's discretion, it looks like we're seeing more [ph] orders picking up. If we're up 15% year-over-year, the combination of RPMs and pricing is not 15%. So there's some discretionary buying and quite likely, maybe some stocking even at the airlines. We know the distributors are in decent shape, so we know that's not moving a whole lot. I did point out -- one thing I did notice that other -- a few other people have announced that we have not seen is significant -- we have not seen any significant provisioning orders.","Gregory Rufus","For 787.","Walter Nicholas Howley","For 787.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, okay. And last one for me. How are you feeling about the cycle overall? It appears there's a lot more skepticism or nervousness in the market overall about the sustainability of this.","Walter Nicholas Howley","You mean in the OEM or the aftermarket?","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, OEM.","Walter Nicholas Howley","I don't know that I have a good enough view on that, David, to drift off of what's sort of the conventional wisdom has been. I don't have any reason to think that '15 is going to drift substantively off of what people have been forecasting so far. I mean, it would take a pretty significant dislocation to change the next 12-month outlook or so.","Operator","The next question comes from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Nick, I think you used the word reasonably active for the M&A pipeline. I was just hoping that you could contextualize that for us, exactly what that might mean.","Walter Nicholas Howley","I was trying to make a distinction between lethargic and wildly active. I mean we're doing the same thing we always do. We're out making calls. We're visiting people. We see proposals coming through. I don't think it's substantively different than it's been for the last 12 or 15 months. But I did want to make that lethargic distinction.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, loud and clear. And then a follow-up on aftermarket. You gave a little bit of color on discretionary versus nondiscretionary and even made a comment -- I thought I heard about some restocking at airlines. I was hoping that -- maybe another layer, just talking about any products that sort of stand out, anything as we try to kind of read the tea leaves here and just understand what's going on a bit better.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. I think the only -- as I say, I don't know that I can draw any particular conclusion from products other than more discretionary things seem to be picking up in orders, where they were lagging behind for a while. And the shipments rate and the booking rate is up more than RPMs and pricing would account for.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then just last one on the general defense outlook. Of course, we all appreciate sort of why there is some uncertainty out there. On the other hand, you highlighted some positives and certainly have had some good trends in the past. I'm just curious if you're seeing literally anything in the numbers that drive the uncertainty or questioning of the defense trend. Or is it just a reflection of the general notion of uncertainty that we all worry about?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I think more of that, more about the general uncertainty. As I said, the revenues were down some in the last quarter, but that's offset by the bookings being up. So it's a mixed picture. But mostly, you're just seeing a reflection of just uncertainty about the political situation.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit more about the buyback that you mentioned, the share repurchase activity?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Rob, I'm not sure what else to say. We bought 75 million more shares back in the last prior month?","Gregory Rufus","No, in the quarter.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. In the third quarter, yes. And as I said, it wouldn't surprise me if we continue to do some of that.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. And is there a change in thought there as you go forward, just from what you've done in the past?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I don't know. I can't say that there is necessarily. We did decide -- we've used all the money to pay out -- not all the money, but I mean all the shareholder return money to pay out special dividends. This time, we decided we'd buy a little back. I -- we'll make the call on a situation-by-situation basis, but it wouldn't surprise me if we buy some more back here.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just a clarification, Nick. Did you say earlier in your monologue, on the aftermarket growth, you were going to stop parsing some element of that out?","Walter Nicholas Howley","No. I usually talk about it in the overall summary of the markets. For the last year, I've made sort of a separate section on it, as I did the lead-in. I'll probably stop doing that. But if there's anything special to point out, I'll try and do it.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Nevertheless, we should still expect the data that you've been giving.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Absolutely, absolutely.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, just wanted to clarify that. And then just the last thing is I just noticed the slide -- you talked about Airborne and some delays in orders, and you also mentioned that there's 1.5% to 2% margin dilution from the acquisitions. This compares to, I think, 1.5% a quarter ago, when you spoke about it. Could you talk a little bit about both the sales and margin contribution from the recent acquisitions and the extent to which these are meeting your plans?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Did we change the dilution? I think it may be just in here for another quarter, so it's in another quarter.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's all it is. It's just...","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. But it's in another quarter and their lower margin is going to pull the year-to-date down a little bit. So there's no reason to think there's any margin degradation in those, other than what we know when we bought it. I would say the Airborne business, we actually -- it is lumpy, but we had a very strong booking quarter here in the last quarter. And we have some big international orders that are hanging fire there, which we can't tell will this wrap before the year's over, in the beginning of next year. But there are jobs to get, we believe. Yes, I think that answers your question probably, Rob.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, are you getting that replacement bow wave you were hoping for when you bought it?","Walter Nicholas Howley","That -- well, the international orders -- we are getting some, but the international orders are closing slower than we thought. But we -- I mean they're active. We're actively negotiating with them. But I think the closure on bookings is, frankly, even lumpier. The first quarter we owned it, we booked very little. That's the first quarter of this year. The second quarter was pretty strong, and the last quarter was very strong. And we have a fair amount of stuff in the gun sight, so...","Operator","The next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. First, on the -- just to clarify a bit on Airborne. By my math, it looks like, for the impact you called out, that's probably down kind of 20% year-on-year quarter on an apples-to-apples basis. Is that the kind of right scale of how lumpy this business can be?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I don't know.","Gregory Rufus","We don't have your math in front of us.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes, I don't have your math in front of us. But it can be lumpy. It can bounce around from quarter to quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I mean, if it's got a 5% impact on the defense revenues, it's probably $8 million, $9 million of revenue delta. So we're just kind of trying to calculate that off of a quarterly run rate, but it sounds like...","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. I don't know the answer, other than I do know, Carter, that it is lumpier than our other businesses tend to be. And they can be lumpy good and lumpy bad.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, exactly. And then on the 787 provisioning that you mentioned a couple of times, how significant -- could that be significant to next year's aftermarket growth, in your view? I mean, is this a couple hundred basis points kind of thing? Or is it...","Walter Nicholas Howley","I don't -- the real answer is, Carter, I'm not sure. We are not -- we'll give next year's guidance when we give it, but we're not planning on a lot of provisioning. We typically look at that as sort of -- we just -- sort of something fell out of the sky and hit us in the head. We're not planning on a lot of it.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to continue on that provisioning line of thinking. I think, Nick, you kind of called out that the aftermarket rate of growth will perhaps be slowing. I mean, there are, I guess, tougher comps coming up, but I would think the 787, even the A350 provisioning. But it sounds like, if we should think about those provisioning items, that would just be kind of gravy on top of your base growth. I'm just trying to get a sense of...","Walter Nicholas Howley","That's the way I would think about it, and my sort of core kind of products, my experience has been it's tough to predict.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. But if -- I mean, you're clearly talking about the market expanding, more discretionary. Is the rate of deceleration, I guess, just tougher comps?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. I'd just -- I don't think you can sustain a 15% quarter-over-quarter growth. You may sustain it for a quarter or 2, but you're not going to sustain that over an extended period of time. And eventually, the comps get tougher.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And then just one other one. You mentioned, on deal activity, maybe a little bit more active in Europe. Are you seeing better multiples over there? I mean, there's more, I guess, carriers struggling with profits. I mean, is it just a more attractive marketplace and are the multiples simply cheaper? Or is there any other rationale for why you're more active in Europe or seeing more activity there?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I really -- we are -- frankly, we're hitting the territory harder. We also put a new guy on to cover the territory, and we're kicking up more leads. So I don't know whether there's more for sale or whether we're just more attentive to it. I would say it's not clear to me that the multiples are significantly lower.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Nadol of JP Morgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Nick, just thinking about -- big picture about the capital structure and looking forward. We're probably going to get into a situation here next year where rates -- short-term rates start going up. We haven't had that, obviously, for a long time. And as you mentioned, you guys have been really eagerly taking advantage of the markets, including this past quarter. How, conceptually, should we think about what you might do differently, if anything at all, when rates are going the other way, just in terms of leverage level? Anything else you want to mention?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. That's -- well, first, I would not -- our fundamental leverage strategy, I would not expect that to change within any realistic range of interest rate moves. Now if interest rate -- interest costs get up higher than the cost of equity, which will be up in the 20s or something, we might rethink that. But in the likely movements over the next couple of years, I wouldn't expect our view to change. Now we did stretch out ahead on some of these dividends because we thought the credit markets were so attractive. If interest rates go up, we probably would be a little more cautious about that. But I don't -- a 1- or 2-point move, I don't think would substantially change what we do.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at OE for a moment. A lot of the growth in the next 2 or 3 years is going to be A350. I unfortunately missed your Analyst Day, and I don't know if you provided an update there on content. But a few years ago, we talked a lot about 787 and what you got on that. Could you just update us on...","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. We have -- I don't think we gave the number out. Did we, on the A350 content? But it's good content. We gave the comparison to the planes we thought it was replacing, and the content is up nicely.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, a nit [ph] here. Is Tarian impacting your defense outlook at all? That was a lumpy item you called out 2 quarters ago.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes, it is in the comps, yes.","Gregory Rufus","It shipped out...","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes, it shipped. There wasn't any in this quarter, but if I look at -- yes, it was -- I think it was in the prior quarter, right?","Gregory Rufus","Year-to-date, we had $10 million of Tarian come out in the first half of the year.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. So yes, it was $10 million in the first half of the prior year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","First, a quick follow-up on the M&A question with regard to Europe. Is there any difference in terms of trying to implement your value-creation drivers in Europe versus the U.S. and then implementing your management and compensation strategy there?","Walter Nicholas Howley","The -- we said we've been able to work through our way on the compensation. It was a little trickier, but we think we've been able to work through that and get something that's pretty close. I would say on the pricing side of it, I don't see any substantive difference. Obviously, the employment restructuring is more expensive there and a little more culturally difficult.","Gregory Rufus","It takes longer.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes. So yes, right, so it -- that converts into a little more expense and it takes longer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. And then in terms of the aftermarket dynamics, sometimes, in the past, you've given us a little more color about what's happening regionally. Would you say that there was particular strength anywhere particular in the world? Or is it kind of broad based?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I would say reasonably broad based. I mean, as usual, I would say the European business is not as bullish as the rest of the world. But I don't know if -- frankly, for the quarter, I don't have the numbers off the top of my -- just my fingertips. But I don't view this -- the mix of RPMs, which is ultimately orders, I don't think -- I know has not changed substantively.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Right. And then just one more quick modeling question. Is 33% tax rate the right one to use going forward?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Greg?","Gregory Rufus","For the remainder of this year. And we'll update our guidance next year when we give it out.","Operator","The next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Stepping back to the provisioning question. I was curious if you had a sense for what percent of your aftermarket sales generally are from initial provisioning and if you can comment if you've had much in the way of 787 provisioning in prior years. Or is it -- that's all on the comp?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I'm not sure I get the question, but I'll try and give you the -- the provisioning, in our experience, has been difficult to predict. The -- we have seen very little, so far, from the 787. I would not -- at least for our go-forward planning, we're not planning on much of that. Now we may well see some, and that would be upside. But I would -- if you were looking at how to model this, I'd primarily focus on sort of RPMs and price and then maybe a little swing one way or the other depending on how you feel about the market direction.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And do provisioning sales carry a different margin or pricing characteristic than typical aftermarket sales?","Walter Nicholas Howley","It's mixed but not substantively, usually.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just back to talking about the M&A pipeline. Can you characterize what's kind of the size -- the typical size range of the companies you're looking to acquire potentially?","Walter Nicholas Howley","The kind of stuff we typically see, which is $40 million transactions to $300 million transactions. Occasionally, we have bigger ones come by or come up opportunistically, and we look at them. But at least, generally, they haven't made sense on a value basis.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And would you say -- I mean, just stepping to the question earlier about how you think people feel about the cycle. Are you seeing more such books now? Are you seeing more willingness to sell properties? Have you seen any change in that?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I can't say I've seen any change.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First of all, on the aftermarket, I was wondering if you could comment or whether you've seen any change in the pattern of parting out or cannibalization out there in the market?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Well, I don't think we have, no. Remember, for the dollar value parts we have, it's a pretty minimal impact. So I -- honestly, if there was a change, I don't know we even notice it for a while. It's a very small -- the cannibalization impact on our sales are very small.","And that's primarily because of the dollar value of the stuff we tend to sell.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And then related aftermarket vein, have you seen any impact of the Afghanistan drawdown starting to roll through, maybe in helicopters?","Walter Nicholas Howley","We have not -- well, I would say, so far this year -- the helicopters were the hot thing last year. The helicopters have not been the hot thing this year, but...","Gregory Rufus","They're not bad.","Walter Nicholas Howley","No, but freighters and fighters have sort of picked up the difference. So I don't know that I can draw much conclusion from that, other than it's just sort of rotation of where you spend your money.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Greg, just a quick one on the dividend equivalency payment. Any idea what this is going to be in Q4?","Gregory Rufus","It's a pretty small amount. $4 million? It's $6 million or $7 million for some options that will come due, so it's a relatively small amount.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And is it going to stay about that run rate for the next 12 months or so?","Gregory Rufus","No, no. I think that'll -- it will be pretty much cut off by the end of this fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Herbert of Canaccord.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up one more time on the commercial aftermarket. And I know its relevancy is maybe limited here, but you do report, from at least a GAAP standpoint or financial reporting standpoint, operating segments, the power and control and airframe. Either in relation of these segments or in general, have you seen any change in your aftermarket by either engine and power related relative to other parts of the airplane? Or has it been sort of fairly consistent growth?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I can't say we've seen any substantive difference in one versus the other. The margins are a little higher on the power side just primarily because the aftermarket content is a little higher on that side.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And I know that [ph] of your total sales, that's maybe, at least on a run rate, about 43%, 44%. But correct me if I'm wrong, engine specific, if I remember well, tends to be about 20% of your aftermarket business?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I don't remember that exactly. I just don't. Engines tend to be 20%, 25% of the cost of the airframe, so that wouldn't surprise me. But I just don't remember that exactly. There's other things in power other than engines in that power segment. There's fluid power, hydraulic power, things like that.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Sure, sure. Okay, that's helpful. And then just finally, any concern or are you seeing anything, again, on the aftermarket as now that we're sort of into it a little further, with some consolidation here? Any different behavior from the U.S. airlines as a result of consolidation, the purchasing patterns? Or anything you could point to there?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I can't say I see anything yet. The market's picking up. And if anything, they may be buying a little ahead of the market pickup. I don't know that I can draw any trend from 3 to 6 months, but the numbers might suggest that.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Liza Sabol for closing remarks.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, everybody, for participating in this morning's call. And please look for our 10-Q that we expect to file tomorrow.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; Chief Operating Officer from our Power Group, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie. A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks and details are contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, we would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in earnings release or our presentation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning. And thanks again, everybody, for calling in this quarter. Today, I'll start off, as usual, with some comments about our consistent strategy, then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 guidance, then Terry will run through the financial activity for the quarter.","To restate again, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products. That is products for which we own the intellectual property. And for most of these, we are the sole source provider.","Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, TransDigm has year-in and year-out generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and financial flexibility.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy; one, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses for significant aftermarket content; second, we have a simple well-proven value-based operating strategy based on our three value driver concept; third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with shareholders; fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns.","And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. As you know, we regularly look closely on our choices for capital allocations, and we basically have four: invest in our existing businesses; two, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy, and these two are almost always our first choices, third, give the extra money back to the shareholders if there is any, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debts. Though, as I've said in the past, given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice.","Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner we think has the best chance to maximize our equity returns.","To update you on a few items, the credit markets remain strong. After our recent financing, our bonds and secured debt are both trading roughly at or above par. We still have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent to those we now pay.","In May, we raised about $2.7 billion, of which $1.9 billion was new debt. The new debt was about one-half bonds and one-half secured debt, roughly half of the new money was used to buy DDC. The current weighted average rate, including our hedges, is about 5.3% pre-tax, or about 3.5% interest after-tax. About 50% of the debt is still fixed and another 25% is hedged or capped. This is about the same average interest cost and the same hedge cap ratio as we've had for the last year or so.","At 7\/2\/16, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we still have adequate financial capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity and while maintaining a reasonable amount of liquidity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds.","Assuming no additional acquisitions or other capital market activity, we anticipate we will have about $1.9 billion of cash at the end of fiscal year 2016. Again, based on today's conditions, we have additional capacity under our credit agreement plus we have the added borrowing capacity of any target acquisition.","We saw a continuing improvement in the total commercial aftermarket revenues in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, our first half commercial aftermarket was up about 7% versus the prior year. Our Q3 was up 8% versus the prior year.","The commercial transport aftermarket, excluding freighters, is up in the low-double-digit percent on both a quarter-versus-prior-year-quarter and a year-to-date basis. However, the business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket segments are weak. Though small individually, in total they pull the overall average increase down a bit.","As I mentioned, in addition to credit market activities, we closed the DDC acquisition at the end of the quarter for $1 billion. This is our second largest deal to-date. DDC is the leading supplier of data bus and power control and related products that are used primarily in military avionics, commercial aerospace and space applications.","The company's core data bus product line has a very large installed base of system worldwide that spans hundreds of unique military and commercial platforms. Revenues are anticipated to be over $200 million for the fiscal year ended December 2016, with approximately 75% coming from the defense market, and the remainder primarily from the commercial transport market.","Approximately 70% of the total revenues are from the aftermarket, with nearly all of the revenues from proprietary and sole source products. In addition to almost all U.S. military aircraft, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the products were also recently selected for use on the Boeing 777X, the Airbus A380, as well as other applications. DDC's primary manufacturing facility is located in Bohemia, New York which is Long Island, with additional facilities in Mexico, UK and California. The business employs about 650 employees. DDC's highly-engineered proprietary products and significant aftermarket fit with our strategic focus and meet our usual investment return criteria.","Turning now to our Q3 fiscal year 2016 and year-to-date performance; I'll remind you again, this is the third quarter for our fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1 of 2015. As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in OEM and aftermarket mix, inventory movements, and modest seasonality and other factors. Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong in the quarter, both the quarter and year-to-date.","For Q3, revenues were up 15% versus the prior-year Q3, and 21% versus the prior-year's nine-month period. EBITDA was up about 23% versus the prior year for both the quarter and the year-to-date period. Overall, organic revenues were up 8% versus prior year Q3 and are up 4% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, on a GAAP basis, commercial aftermarket revenues were up more, while defense and commercial OEM were up a little less. EBITDA As Defined dollars and margin percent, were both strong in the quarter.","Now, reviewing the revenues by market category; again, this is only pro forma basis versus the prior year Q3 and year-to-date, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. This does not include the just acquired DDC business.","The primary difference between the 5% pro forma growth in Q3 and the 8% GAAP reported organic growth is the one-month lag in the financial reporting for Telair in Q3 of 2015. We reported this last year if you recall. This will negatively impact the GAAP organic growth in Q4. To remind you, we use the pro forma or same-store growth to more clearly reflect our management view of the actual situation.","In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues are up about 4% for Q3 versus the prior-year and are now up about 1% on a year-to-date basis. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up most of our commercial OEM business, are up 6% versus the prior Q3 and about 3% on a year-to-date basis.","Year-to-date bookings for commercial transport continue to run modestly ahead of revenues. Commercial transport is about on our expectations at the start of the fiscal year. The biz jet and helicopter revenues are a much smaller percent of our OEM revenues, but the revenues in this market continue down. Q3 revenues and bookings were both down in the third quarter. The bookings and revenues in the biz jet and helicopter markets are now both almost 7% below prior year-to-date. The biz jet and helicopter markets in total are weaker than we expected at the start of the fiscal year.","Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 8% for this quarter versus the prior-year, and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis versus the prior-year, as I said, commercial transport revenues, excluding freighters, are now up 10% year-over-year with soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues pulling the average down a bit. Total year-to-date commercial aftermarket bookings are still running modestly ahead of our shipments.","The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year 2016 Q3 were up 3% versus prior year Q3, and are now just about flat on a year-to-date basis. The revenue by product line continues spotty; however, Q3 defense bookings were down significantly versus the prior year on a tough comparison. Bookings are now running just slightly ahead of revenues on a year-to-date basis. Most of the booking shortfall is timing on a few large OEM orders, including A400M order slowdown to adjust for inventory. Defense aftermarket orders were also a little weak in Q3. These are quicker turn and could have some modest impact on our Q4 shipments.","Moving to profitability, and on a reported basis now, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The as-defined adjustments in Q3 were refinancing-related expenses, non-cash compensation, and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. The EBITDA As Defined of about $384 million for Q3 and $1.1 billion year-to-date, both are up 23% versus the prior year periods.","The EBITDA As Defined margin was a strong 48% of revenue for Q3 and about 48% on a year-to-date basis. This is up \u2013 47%, excuse me, on a year-to-date basis. This is up 1% versus last year-to-date in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions. As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in Q1 of this year. This, combined with our other value drivers, contributed to the strong margins.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is still active, more small-to-mid sized deals than large. Closings, as I always say, are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Turning now to the 2016 guidance, we continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle though it is holding up so far, and would have little impact on this year in any event.","As I said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see a lot of noise in various industry forecasts and the tone hasn't been great. Wide bodies have obviously softened. Narrow-bodies, on the other hand, seemed to be doing okay.","In the commercial aftermarket, air travel with a few exceptions is holding up reasonably well. The biz jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarkets are softer than we originally anticipated and would seem likely to continue so for a bit. All-in-all, this is our best estimate for the balance of the year and includes the DDC acquisition.","Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond DDC in fiscal year 2016, the guidance is as follows. The midpoint of our fiscal year 2016 guidance is $3.18 billion. This is up $14 million from our prior guidance. We've increased the revenue to reflect the DDC acquisition. The decline in forecast biz jet and helicopter revenues and slightly softer defense revenues offset a portion of this. We're up about 18% on a GAAP basis year-over-year.","The midpoint of the fiscal year of 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now $1.49 billion. That's an increase of $30 million from the prior guidance. This is up 21% on a full year-over-full year basis. The increase in guidance is driven both by the DDC acquisition and the improvements in our base EBITDA margin. The DDC acquisition is the largest dollar part of this increase. The base business, excluding the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49%, or up 2.5 points versus 2015 from the same mix of businesses. The recent acquisition margins also continue running at or a bit ahead of our original estimates.","The midpoint of the EBITDA as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.30 per share, that's up $0.14 from our last guidance. This is up about 25% versus the prior year. The increase in EPS guidance is due primarily to the acquisition of DDC and the improvement in the core business results and improvement in the overall tax rate. Two of those things partially offset by increased interest on the new debt.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following growth rates: commercial aftermarket revenue growth is still forecast in the mid to high-single digits. We're a bit cautious on the upside of this range, primarily due to the soft biz jet, helicopter and freighter revenues I discussed.","The defense and military revenues are more likely flat to perhaps slightly down versus the prior year. The weaker Q3 bookings led us to temper the full-year forecast a bit. The commercial OEM revenue growth in the low-single-digit percent, we still believe commercial transport shipments will be up mid-single digits, but it now appears the biz jet and helicopter shipments for the year will be down in the mid to high-single-digit percent range.","Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activities, we expect to have about $1.9 billion in cash and about $600 million in undrawn revolver at fiscal year-end 2016. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.4 times EBITDA at the end of 2016. We will review our capital allocations during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year or the first quarter of next year. And based on the business and capital market conditions at that time, we'll make a decision as to how to proceed. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and our strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our equity investors.","And with that, let me hand this over to Terry.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you. Nick. I will now review our financial results. Third quarter net sales were $798 million, or approximately 15% greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, PneuDraulics and Breeze. Organic sales were up approximately 8.3%, driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales.","The organic growth also was positively impacted due to the prior period including only two months of Telair and Franke due to a reporting lag. Q4 2015 included four months of Telair and Franke to catch up on that lag. Our third quarter gross profit was $444 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.6% was about 3.5 margin points higher than the prior year. A decrease in acquisition-related costs versus the prior year, partially offset by the acquisition operating margin dilution contributed about one-half a point to the higher reported margin.","Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margin in the business versus the prior-year quarter improved 3 margin points. The operations continue to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continuing improving our cost structure.","Additionally, sequential gross profit margins improved about a half a point excluding all acquisition activity. Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.8% of sales for the current quarter and the same in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales, compared to 10% of sales a year ago.","We have an increase in interest expense of approximately $14 million versus the prior year quarter. This is the result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $8.7 billion in the current quarter versus $7.6 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the recent financing completed during the quarter that Nick previously discussed.","As part of the financing, we borrowed an incremental $1.9 billion, of which the proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including potential future dividends or share repurchases. As part of the financing, we received an amendment to allow for a special dividend and\/or stock buybacks up to $1.5 billion. At this time, no decision has been made on the use of the additional proceeds.","And as Nick mentioned, investing in our existing business and making accretive acquisitions are always our first choices. Including the new incremental debt, we expect our full-year 2016 net interest expense to be approximately $485 million.","Our effective tax rate was 27.6% in the current quarter, compared to 28.6% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rates and the impact of discrete tax benefits received primarily from the R&D credit related to our filing of our fiscal 2015 return during this quarter.","We will adopt the new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. The new standard is related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and now will be recognized in an income tax provision on the income statement. This change will bring our effective tax rate closer to our cash tax rate. Considering the impact of this new accounting treatment, our full-year estimated tax rate is expected to be around 25%. Our estimated tax rate for adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately 30%, which excludes the accounting standard change I just discussed.","Our net income for the quarter increased $41 million, or 42% to $141 million, which is 17.6% of sales. This compares to net income of $99 million, or 14.3% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in our net sales and improvements to our operating margin, resulting from the strength of our proprietary products, continued productivity efforts and other items. Lower interest expense and refinancing costs as a percentage of net sales also contributed to the increase in net income as a percentage of net sales.","GAAP EPS was $2.52 per share in the current quarter, compared to $1.75 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $3.09 per share, an increase of 36.7%, compared to $2.26 per share last year. Please refer to table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles the GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Now, switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.67 billion of cash. This includes approximately $850 million of proceeds from the financing we put on the balance sheet for use for general purposes.","The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.7 times our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and our gross leverage was 6.8 times pro forma EBITDA As Defined. Excluding any additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we now expect our cash balance to be about $1.9 billion and net leverage to be approximately 5.4 times at the end of fiscal 2016.","With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.23. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint for our adjusted EPS to be $11.30. The $1.07 of adjustments to bridge the GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions; $0.05 from dividend equivalent payments, $0.57 from non-cash stock option expense, $0.88 of acquisition-related expenses, $0.20 of refinancing costs. And these are all partially offset by $0.63 due to reducing fourth quarter income tax provision from the adoption of the new accounting standard I previously mentioned.","Now, I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Operator, we are currently ready to open the lines. We do ask that you limit your questions to two per caller and then reinsert yourself into the queue to allow time for everyone to ask questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.

And is maybe the helicopter and business jet weakness, I know there are more than perhaps you expected, but are you seeing surprise to the upside from what you're hearing from your airline or commercial transport customers?","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. I also just to point out, the freighter business, which isn't a big part, but it doesn't help, is a little \u2013 that's probably a little softer than we might have thought. But if we are \u2013 I mean, just almost mathematically if we are holding our guidance, but the biz jet and helicopters are lower, that means the rest of it has to be a little better.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. It sounds like, though, you're maybe walking us away from the upper end of the guidance a little bit, from your comments.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That was the comment. I have to admit I'm a little concerned. And, I don't have any particular inside knowledge here, but I'm a little concerned where the bottom is on biz jet and helicopter aftermarket.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think it's a big deal for the balance of the year here. We can't move it much, but could move it a hair.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","But it sounds like that could certainly spill into fiscal 2017?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. We'll comment on that when we get there. And Ken, I don't want to start to speculate on that piece by piece.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And then, if I could, have you seen anything different in terms of inventory levels \u2013 again on the aftermarket \u2013 either within your distribution channel or within end users over the last quarter?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I can't say anything. We have, I would say, individual units. We see some distributor movement, but on balance, I don't think it's a substantive impact.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Well, thank you very much and nice quarter.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good morning, Nick and everyone.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Nick, in your prepared remarks, you'd mentioned that you're seeing some more softness in the wide-body market but the narrow-body market seems to be okay. I don't know if you could just maybe add some color to that, wax on on both of those a little bit more on what you're seeing, because it really does seem like there's a bit of a bifurcation in the market.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. And I don't \u2013 I mean, all I'm doing is reporting on \u2013 I'm just sort of reporting back what we hear from our customers, which is very close to the same things they're announcing publicly. You've seen the A330, A380 and 747 rates get cut back. Whereas on the wide body \u2013 or in the narrow body, you're not seeing that. If anything, they're still rumbling, they might step them up a little. And I don't have any more insight into that. And I would say our business roughly reflects that same thing.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Yes. Yes. And then, if I may, just a quick follow-on. Over at Farnborough, we've talked to several different suppliers, and some of them mentioned that some of the OEs might be trying to second source some things today that are currently sole sourced. Has that had any impact on your business? And what is your thought on that? Is it an opportunity, a threat?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It is not. I would point out that, one, we tend to have agreements in place with most of the OEs for the products. And the other is that the vast majority of what we have is proprietary. It's not hard \u2013 not impossible, but it's significantly more difficult to replace a proprietary product than a non-proprietary one.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Or, in other words, when you own the IP, much of what I have seen at least in the \u2013 what I've heard and what I've seen publicly, is replacing non-proprietary stuff.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Okay. Great.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","In other words, when the supplier doesn't own the IP.","Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Carter Copeland at Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey, Carter.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Nick, I wondered if you could help us maybe just parse the impact in biz jet and freighter. As you look through that, do you have a sense of how much of that is real declines versus destock? Is there a portion of that that you wouldn't expect to repeat next year because it is destock?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I know it's not easy to answer.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Let me try that in pieces. In the helicopter business, Carter, I obvious \u2013 I don't know where the bottom of that is. As you know what's driving that, the big driver there is the oil prices are off, so all the stuff servicing that industry is sort of in a swoon. I'd like to think it's close to the bottom but, frankly, I'm just not sure. Fortunately, it's not a lot of our business.","I would say in the business jet, in the OEM business, once again, I'd like to think that \u2013 well, in the OEM business, I'm sure there is some inventory drawdown there that I would hope would not repeat. But I also would have to say I think, I and the rest of the industry has been notoriously inaccurate when predicting this business jet production rate. It's been \u2013 every year, it's been going to go up since 2010 or 2011 and really hasn't gone up much. The aftermarket, I think, is more stable in the business jet.","In the freighter business, I think you know what's going on there. Freight traffic is just slowing down some. I think there's been \u2013 there I'm pretty comfortable that there's been some inventory drawdown throughout the system. I can't quantify that, but I'm quite sure there's been some. I hope that would stabilize next year.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just to help me square the math on the difference between the stated organic growth numbers and then when you look at it by segment, obviously implies that the pro forma growth in some of the things you acquired had some pretty sizeable declines. Is that a Breeze-Eastern?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Let me try that. Carter, I guess I didn't make myself clear and I'll try it once. And if it doesn't \u2013 if I tangle the accounting up \u2013 Terry can hop in and replace me or replace me, can hop in and give it some better words.","If you may or may not remember, when we bought Telair last year, we had a transition agreement with AAR where they would do the accounting for a quarter while we got things switched over. The net result of that is because of the turn times, we had to be on a one-month lag in the previous year's third quarter. So, we only had two months. And this year, we have three months.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So when we report on a GAAP basis, it makes the growth number larger. When we go back and do it on a same-store basis, it's smaller, when we assume we own the same things in both periods, if that's clear.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Perfect. Perfectly clear.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's the bulk of the difference. There may be a little bit here. The vast majority of 3% spread is that.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think it's important to know, Carter, though, by next quarter there's going to be four months in Q4 2015 versus three months in Q4 of 2016.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. So, it's going to \u2013 and the gap is going to (35:46).","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It'll go the other direction in the fourth quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Wonderful. Thanks for the color, guys.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co.","This is Gavin Parsons on for Noah. Good morning, everyone.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just looking at the defense aftermarket, on bookings, presumably you can make up the OEM orders that slipped, but you said aftermarket was a bit weak.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Should we draw any conclusion from the aftermarket demand or is that more random lumpiness in the bookings?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I would say the OEM stuff is just pure timing. We had some big orders in the third quarter of the prior year, and then we didn't get them this year, plus we had a couple of things slip out. Probably the biggest single one was the A400. They're ordering at lower rates frankly, because they probably had a little too much inventory with all the moving around in their shipments.","The aftermarket was \u2013 and I don't want to overemphasize this, but the aftermarket was a little softer than we expected. I don't think that's anything more than random variation, but it can a little bit of that we anticipate to turn fast in the fourth quarter. And I'm a little concerned that it won't come in in time. That's all I was trying to \u2013 the point I was trying to make there. And that's why we hedged our defense business down a little.","Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And then DDC, maybe in that context, and within the five-year military outlook for flat to modestly up, given DDC is already pretty high margin, can you give us an idea of where we can go from here in terms of DDC margin and in terms of revenue growth, maybe given a little bit of...?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't want to speculate on individual businesses. I will tell you that when we do the DDC math when we bought it, we look at it the same way we look at all the other businesses. Roughly half \u2013 that half equity, something like that. And over the five-year period, assuming we buy-sell, we still see a return on our equity up in the 20% range. And that still works.","Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And could you comment on where aftermarket bookings were relative to revenue in the quarter?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think I did. They ran ahead, not a lot ahead, but they ran modestly ahead.","Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","This is commercial I'm talking about.","Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Michael Ciarmoli at KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's actually Kevin on for Mike. Been seeing a lot of pressure from the EU airlines in terms of passenger traffic, airline profit, just given the economic environment there. Are you seeing behavioral changes from your customers in Europe as a result of that at this point? Or how are you guys looking out maybe longer term, from that sense?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I can't say we've seen anything different in the last quarter than we've seen in the past. As you know \u2013 we, for the last, probably, I don't know, 15 months, though it's getting a little better now, our view has been, across the world, in ordering, airlines have been ordering at a lower rate than their consumption. But I can't say it's recovering some now, but I can't say we've seen any change in the last quarter or any specific change in the European airlines.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Let me back that up a minute, just a second to be clear. We have seen some change in the last couple of quarters. We still, seems to me, like they're not quite up to their consumption rate in ordering.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then, Nick, since you closed on DDC, anything incremental you've learned there in terms of the business versus what you expected? Based on the last answer you gave, it sounds like it's going fairly well.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It looks a fine business. We've only owned it for -","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kevin, what is it? Four weeks or six weeks?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, a little over a month.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. We don't know \u2013 let me tell you, it's \u2013 we look like we got what we expected. Surely, no worse and, hopefully, maybe a little better. So far, we don't \u2013 no bad news, and that's always good.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Robert Spingarn at Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, I wanted to ask you about the difference in your sales versus the difference in your cost of goods sold. Even when adjusting for the inventory step-ups, there's a pretty big spread there. And does that speak to pricing year-over-year?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. So, let me give a try and then I let Terry, I always talk about EBITDA margins because, frankly, it captures everything in my view. The EBITDA margins are up and they're up with fair amount versus last year. And as I think, there's a couple of things doing that. As you know, we do okay in the pricing and that impacts it. But the other thing is we \u2013 at the beginning of this year, we took about 4% or so more out of our head count sort of to get ready for a possible downturn in the OEM business, and that hasn't happened. So, we have a little better cost structure and the revenues have hung in. Those are the two significant contributors.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. And I think if you do the adjustments you do on slide 10, it even extends that benefit or magnifies it. In other words, between the cost takeout and the pricing you're speaking to, Nick, this is really a very substantial benefit.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're doing a decent job of grinding the margins out.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Was there...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I would say the acquisitions we have made in the last couple of years -you're talking about the numbers without the acquisition stripped out, I presume.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No. These are the GAAP numbers, I imagine, that we're looking at.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You're right. The acquisitions \u2013 in general, our acquisition margins are better than we anticipated when we bought them also.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And was there any timing lag to the cost takeout in fiscal Q1 and the fact that we're seeing this now in fiscal Q3?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think there's any unusual. We had a lot of acquisition activity. And so, there's a lot of different mixes from the timing of when things occurred. But there's nothing usual comes to mind.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. I mean, there may have been whenever we finished doing the customers, probably some severance that had along within it, but...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just on the timing on the commercial OEs, you spoke to it before when you were talking about the wide-body weakness, et cetera, but any particular reason why this quarter saw some acceleration in the commercial OE, relative to the beginning of the year?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. I don't think so. Rob, I think it's just normal. I don't think anything substantively changed \u2013 well, let me back up. In the commercial transport world, I don't think anything has substantially changed of what we expected in the beginning of the year. I do think the biz jet has continued to soften through the year more than we expected.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But does that change at all your view \u2013 I think I asked you this last time, and if you spoke to this earlier, apologies \u2013 but are you still looking for 4% organic growth for the year?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We disclosed it. I'm just not looking at \u2013 what's the number we disclosed?","(43:34)","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We didn't disclose it, okay. We gave a number, Rob, we didn't give the organic. But as you saw, I think you saw our guidance for the year. Our revenues \u2013 I don't want to start speculating on that without all the math in front of me. But not a substantive change either way.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Even with this pressure you just spoke to, the biz jet, et cetera, you still feel pretty much --?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I mean we haven't disclosed that number, so I don't want to back into it. The guidance we gave is the guidance we gave. I'm always very nervous about stabbing at a number when I haven't seen the math of it.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Okay. Well, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Gautam Khanna at Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I have a couple of questions. One, I was wondering, on the back of Ron's question, are you seeing the OEMs requiring that on new product development, that they own the IP, such that they get a bigger piece of the aftermarket going forward for new parts? Have you seen any of that pressure?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Could you just first \u2013 at the beginning of your question, the words got a little garbled.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC","I'm sorry. Hopefully this is better. I was asking, are you seeing the OEMs put any more pressure on controlling the IP on new product developments as a condition for bidding?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We have not seen that yet. But we've heard people talked about it, other people. We haven't seen it.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC","You haven't seen it? Okay. Two other ones, if I may. One, I was wondering, what do you think \u2013 what level of leverage could you be at to support a special dividend? I mean what level would you be uncomfortable going beyond? (45:35)","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think I want to speculate on that. I think our \u2013 just let me ask Terry, if the credit agreement is public data.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. Public data.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, we have a credit agreement that we recently renegotiated, allows us to pay out up to $1.5 billion by 12\/31\/2016. That doesn't say we're going to do that, but that's sort of the level we could go up to when you could sort of solve into the math there.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And last one, Nick, I just wondered what your plans are, if you thought about it, and when you may communicate it to the Street. I know, if I recall, Kevin has an agreement that allows him to leave at the end of 2017. Just wanted to get your plans on succession, if you've given any thought to it yet or willing to share (46:25)","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're not prepared for it \u2013 we're not prepared to talk about that. I have a contract that runs through 2019, and you know the contract is what it is. But we're not prepared to talk about that. And, quite frankly, I enjoy the business and still like it here.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC","All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from David Strauss at UBS. Your line is now open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. A question, I guess, along those same lines, Nick. $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet. You're going to generate, I guess, an additional $200 million in the fourth quarter. It's not like you to just sit around on this kind of cash balance for long. What do you think in there?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","What I'm thinking? Myles (sic) [David] (47:19), what I'm thinking is, through this fourth quarter and the beginning of next year, we'll look at the lay of the land and we'll decide what to build. I mean, you're right, we're not \u2013 unless we see something substantive relatively near-term use for a whole lot of money, we'll probably pay something out. What did I say?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Myles (sic) [David] (47:43).","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm Myles (sic) [David] (47:43). David, excuse me.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","That's all right, Nick. I'll let it go.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm looking up at the screen here, and it has Myles' (sic) [David's] (47:49) name. But then you're up at top. Oh, I see. I'm looking at my cheat sheet, I apologize.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","All right, no worries.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But we love you just the same.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I'll call in a favor for that one. On the aftermarket, are you benefiting at this point at all from any initial sparing on the MAX?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think so. At least it's nothing material and not discernible.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then I guess, Terry, one for you. You talk about 30% tax rate on the adjusted basis this year. Is that a good number to think about going forward into 2017?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not going to speculate where we'll be at 2017 once we roll our plan. But I would say, it's probably going to be in the ballpark and that's going to be the number for the rest of the year. One thing that we don't know is the mix of business, and how things play out as we move into 2017. So that rate could change on us a little bit here or there plus or minus.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Myles Walton at Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Nick, you can call me Dave if it makes up (49:14) First one, maybe just to clarify on that last piece of tax rate, so the adjustment -- you're excluding the changes in accounting benefit. Should we think about that, Terry, as an ongoing adjustment? Are you going to try and keep it clean and stable or is this a one year because of how big the adjustment is?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I got to ask you, Myles, is that opposed to dirty and unstable?","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, I'll leave it to Terry.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I just wanted to lay the groundwork into the playing (49:48) field.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, I know.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","This new accounting change everybody is going to have to go through. As you know, we don't have any control over what timing when people exercise their stock options. So, what we'll do is continue to pull this out of the adjusted EPS. And that's why we want to give you a rate that's closer to that, say, 30%. But what this will do is drive down our cash tax rate, assuming our effective tax rate will be a lot closer to our cash tax rate, which I know you guys have asked for in the past, which gets us around that 25%.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, I'll follow up with it.","And then the other one, Nick, can you comment on the distribution buying behavior in the aftermarket? Are you seeing any changing in how the distributors are buying in terms of their patterns? Are they adding volatility to the noise in the aftermarket or are they pretty much straight pass-throughs?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. In total, I don't think so, though there's some puts and takes. In the freighter business, we've probably seen a little more volatility in distributor ordering because, frankly, they're looking at that market and doesn't look as good. But I think that's \u2013 it isn't a lot of money and it's been offset in the other direction. So, in total, I don't think it's impacting the numbers materially at this point.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the only clarifications -- you said $1.9 billion on the balance sheet, and I think you took out $900 million excess cash. Last quarter it was $1.1 billion. Is that just rounding or did operating cash flow, free cash flow, get adjusted at all?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. I don't think there's anything unusual there. We've had some puts and takes. We think about fees associated with the financing. You have higher interest cost. We have just M&A activity, different expenses and things of that nature that have impacted the net cash and then working capital has also an impact on the numbers, but nothing -- just a lot of puts and takes gets you down to $1.9 billion.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","So, when you guys head into a quarter -- the nature of my question is about visibility on commercial aftermarket sales -- when you go into a given quarter, how much of your revenue is known? And has that changed at all over the last maybe 18 months to 24 months?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think it's changed substantially over the last 18 months to 24 months. I would say the lion's share of it you know going into a quarter, but when you're looking for is it a 3% change or 5% change or 8% or whatever, within a couple of \u2013 you have a few points still to be booked and shipped.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And so, the bulk of it, you know, but you don't know all of it.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","And that's probably the toughest to predict or choppiest segment of your business, probably, you'd say, right?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's the fastest turn part.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Okay. And then...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Let me just add there.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Over the long haul, over any length period of time, 12 months, 18 months or something like that, if you do kind of a rolling average, it's probably the easier thing to predict. But for quarters, it can bounce around.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Even easier than OE?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. It depends what \u2013 it is much less cyclical. Maybe I picked the wrong time period, maybe 12 months or 18 months is too short a period. But for any longer period of time, the aftermarket is more predictable than the OEM.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. I got you. Okay. Cool. And then...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Maybe stabler is another way of putting it.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure, makes sense. And on the 10% aftermarket growth in the commercial transport, can you give us any more color on what's driving that strength? However you want to talk about, whether it's a geography, aircraft type, is it like a pricing versus volume? And if there's anything that's...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think is there any \u2013 we don't comment on the pricing.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I would say pricing patterns are no different than they have been historically, at least for us. I would say the main thing that's driving it is, I think we have published this chart a number of times, it can be somewhat cyclical. And I speculate that the airlines have been undermined for the last, I don't know, 12 months, something like that, 15 months, and they're starting to catch up.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Just globally. Okay. Thank you, Nick.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much and good morning. Just to follow-up on some of the questions about capital deployment to sort of qualify or clarify a little bit of what you said before. The cash that you have on the balance sheet, it seems like you're looking at an either\/or thing, either there will be a sizeable acquisition or there will be a dividend, and not necessarily looking at some kind of combination of smaller acquisitions as we've seen in the past. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know that it's binary like that.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You know, either it could well be a mix. I just \u2013 we'll decide that as we get closer. And depending on what \u2013 two things, what the capital market situation looks like and what's the sort of near-term acquisition landscape looks like. But I don't think I'd say it's that binary.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. That's good to clarify. And then just on the profitability front, obviously very impressive margins this quarter. As you think about, not necessarily this point but once we integrate DDC, do you still think about the same type of generic margin expansion potential annually going forward as you have in the past? I think you've probably talked in the past about being able to generate a point or so of margin opportunity of margin in the base business, and then you add acquisitions and that pulls down the average and you move it up over time. Still fair to think about it from this new level?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I would say, first I don't want to speculate about next year's margin. We'll give...","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I know but generically.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I would say I don't \u2013 there is nothing fundamentally changing in the dynamics of this business.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Liza Sabol for closing remarks.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, everyone, for participating in this morning's call and please look for our 10-Q that we expect to file tomorrow.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Liza Sabol, Investor Relations.","Liza Sabol","Thank you and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2019 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Presenting this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.","Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC.","We'd also like to advise you that, during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley","Good morning and thanks for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with some summary comments on our consistent business strategy, a few comments on the operating performance and outlook and capital allocation.","To reiterate, we're unique in the industry due to both our consistency and our ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and over three quarters of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which typically have significantly higher margins and provide relative stability in the downturns. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as the careful allocation of our capital.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy. Specifically, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns our management team with the shareholders' interest.","Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit our strategy and we see a clear, simple path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and our allocations are a key part of our value creation methodology.","As you saw from our press release, we had a solid operating performance in fiscal year 2019, where the revenue is up 37% and EBITDA As Defined up about 29% on a reported basis. Organically, our revenue was up almost 11% and EBITDA As Defined up 14%. Including the dividends paid in August, our shareholders made about a 48% return in the last fiscal year, a pretty good year.","Far and away, the largest portion of our business, our worldwide commercial aerospace markets, were strong in fiscal year 2019. The smaller worldwide defense segment also did well. The TransDigm legacy businesses performed well. The Esterline acquired businesses continue to exceed our acquisition model with a Q4 EBITDA As Defined margin of over 30%. In 2020, we will include Esterline in the core businesses and no longer break it out separately.","Fiscal year 2020 looks like another good year for TransDigm. Revenue and EBITDA As Defined are both estimated to be up nicely. All our market segments appear to be in pretty good shape. There are some potential clouds on the horizon in the commercial aerospace market, but we're watching this closely and we're prepared to react quickly if required. Kevin will discuss 2019 and 2020 in significant more detail.","With respect to M&A and capital allocation, as previously announced, we executed agreements to sell both the Souriau business for about $920 million, and the EIT group of businesses for about $190 million. We closed the EIT deal and received the cash in September.","We still hope to close the Souriau divestiture by the end of our fiscal first quarter 2020. We may still sell some smaller business with -- businesses with less proprietary aerospace and aftermarket content, but if we do so, at least as of today, I don't think they will be significant in size.","We also completed a roughly $2.6 billion financing recently. About $1.5 billion is for general corporate purposes and the balance is used to refinance and extend the payments on some other debt. We wanted to take advantage of an accommodating credit market and attractive rates.","With respect to capital allocation, we paid a $30 billion dividend in Q4 of 2019. We will review our capital allocation situation over the quarter and see where we stand towards the end of the calendar year.","Absent any new capital market activity and assuming our recent divestiture closes in a timely fashion, we'd expect to have almost $4 billion of cash at the end of Q1 2020. That's on or about 12\/31\/19.","We also have a significant additional borrowing capacity under our credit line and our credit agreement. We have substantial liquidity and the financial flexibility to deal with any currently anticipated capital deployment, allocation or other opportunities that may arise in the readily foreseeable future.","We continue to actively evaluate and seek M&A opportunities. We have a decent pipeline of possibilities, as usual mostly in the small and mid-sized. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but as I said before, we are working steadily at M&A and we're still open for business.","Now, let me hand it over to Kevin to review our 2019 performance, 2020 outlook, and some other items.","Kevin Stein","Thanks Nick. Today, I will review our results by key markets and discuss the profitability of the business for the quarter, provide fiscal 2020 guidance, and then review some other operational items.","As you've seen, we had a strong fourth quarter to end another very good year. Mike will provide more details on the financials. As Nick has said, full year revenue and EBITDA As Defined were up substantially over last year due in part to above-average organic growth as well as continued acquisition integration and performance.","Now, we will review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2018. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. Please note this market analysis section excludes Esterline for fiscal 2019. However, we will begin to include the former Esterline businesses in our market analysis for fiscal 2020.","In the commercial market, which makes up close to 70% of our revenue, we split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our commercial OEM market revenue increased approximately 11% in both Q4 and for full year fiscal 2019 over the prior year periods.","This full year OEM revenue growth exceeded our last guidance expectation of growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. This growth occurred despite a limited headwind from the impact of 737 MAX grounding. The 737 MAX situation is one we continue to closely monitor.","Now, moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by 9% over the prior year quarter. Total fiscal 2019 grew about 8%, in line with our full year guidance expectations of high single-digit percent growth.","In the quarter, growth in the commercial transport passenger and freight markets was slightly offset by a decline in the interior submarket. Repairs and retrofits for Telair International on Boeing 747 freighters and retrofit igniters for G650 business jets from Champion were a few of the strong areas for commercial aftermarket worth noting. Overall, commercial transport fundamentals continue to remain relatively strong, although a few items bear watching.","Global revenue passenger growth has decelerated slightly in the past few months, albeit growth is still near the long-term average. Additionally, cargo demand is weaker as FTKs have declined from reaching an all-time high in 2017.","Now, let me speak about our defense market, which is just over 30% of our total revenue. The defense market, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, was up approximately 7% over the prior year Q4.","As a reminder, this quarter, we began to lap tougher prior year comparisons as our defense revenue started to accelerate in Q4 of last year. Full year defense revenue grew 14%.","Last year, we reported strong defense bookings that we saw materialize into sales this year. This robust growth was well distributed and appears to be driven from most businesses that support defense-related platforms.","Now, moving to profitability. I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. EBITDA As Defined of about $707 million for Q4 was up 35% versus prior Q4, and $2.42 billion or up 29% on a full year basis. EBITDA As Defined margin in the quarter of 45.9% was negatively impacted by acquisition dilution from Esterline.","Excluding Esterline, margins in our legacy business were over 50% and improved both sequentially as well as over the prior year's quarter. Margin improvement progress is always important to us and indicates that our base business continued to find opportunities to drive improvement by using our value drivers.","Now, let me give you an update on the Esterline integration and expectations. Over eight months post close, the Esterline integration continues to progress well. We have now largely wound down the former corporate office activities in Bellevue, Washington. The functions that used to be performed here have been migrated to the business units or moved over to our Cleveland corporate office.","As noted before, we have equipped the Esterline integration team with senior TransDigm legacy EVPs who are teaching our culture and operating model around value generation to all new business units.","We are making progress here, but as you know, culture change can be slow and requires constant reinforcement. To-date, we are exceeding our expectations for growth in this largest of TransDigm acquisitions.","Turning now to 2020 guidance, also found on slide seven in the presentation. In general, continued global revenue passenger mile growth, a favorable environment for defense spending, both domestically and internationally, and generally positive economic conditions provide a backdrop for continued success and growth in the marketplace.","Certainly, global trade dynamics, continued 737 MAX grounding and shipping delays, political risks, or other exogenous events could have a negative impact on market conditions for TransDigm. We will closely watch these, as we always do, and we'll react as necessary, including taking any preemptive steps that might be warranted.","Based on this and assuming no acquisitions in fiscal year 2020, our initial guidance for continuing operations is as follows. The midpoint of our fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance is $6.25 billion or up approximately 20%.","As in past years, with roughly 10% less working days in fiscal year 2020 quarter one, revenues, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin are anticipated to be lower than the other three quarters of fiscal year 2020, roughly in proportion to the lower working days. This revenue guidance is based on the following market channel growth assumptions. Note these pro forma market assumptions now include Esterline.","We expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-single-digit to high single-digit percent range versus prior year, commercial OEM revenue growth in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit percent range, defense military revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range versus prior year.","The midpoint of fiscal year 2020 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $2.83 billion with an expected margin of around 45.2%, up almost 17%. This includes almost 6 points of margin dilution from Esterline.","Again, we anticipate EBITDA margin will move up throughout the year, as we have seen in previous years, with Q1 being the lowest and sequentially lower than Q4. The midpoint of adjusted EPS is anticipated to be $20.50. Mike will discuss in more detail shortly -- and the factors impacting EPS.","Finally, I would like now to briefly review some executive management changes. As you know, we continually work to improve our bench strength of promotable talent to keep a focus on succession planning. As such, we recently promoted Marko Enderlein and Patrick Murphy to the Executive Vice President role.","Marko has worked for TransDigm for over three years as the President of the Telair International team. And prior to joining us, he spent over 15 years at Airbus in financial and leadership roles. Marko will be our first EVP in Europe, responsible for much of our European footprint.","Patrick has worked for TransDigm for over 4 years now as the President of HarcoSemco and prior held a variety of senior roles in leadership at Danaher Corporation over an eight-year career.","These promotions give us the resources we need to oversee the expanded group of business units following the Esterline acquisition as well as to backfill for Jim Skulina, who is retiring at the end of the calendar year.","So, let me conclude by stating fiscal 2019 was another good year for TransDigm. We continue to be very pleased with the Esterline acquisition integration as well as the strong operational performance in our legacy businesses. We look forward to 2020 and expect that our consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you have come to expect from us.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our CFO, Mike Lisman.","Michael Lisman","Good morning everyone. Nick and Kevin covered the highlights, so I'm just going to really quickly hit on a few additional financial details. First, for full year FY 2019 and then second, for the FY 2020 guidance that Kevin just covered.","As mentioned on our last earnings call, the Esterline organization as it used to exist, including the corporate office, is largely now gone, and the business units which used to comprise Esterline report independently into TransDigm within our power, airframe and non-aviation segments. We therefore don't plan to give any specific color around Esterline's performance, separate from that of legacy TransDigm.","During the quarter, both EIT and Souriau were moved into discontinued operations. When you make this accounting change, the results from these business units get completely removed from the individual line items of the P&L and collapsed onto the disc ops line. So, the net result was that it's almost like we never owned them, except for the discontinued operations line.","Now, for the consolidated TransDigm business, a few quick notes on how we ended FY 2019. Adjusted EPS for the year was $18.27, up 2.5% from FY 2018. And as a reminder, our FY 2018 EPS saw a significant onetime benefit from the implementation of U.S. tax reform that muddies any year-over-year EPS comparisons.","On taxes, we came in slightly better than expected with an FY 2019 GAAP and cash tax rates of 21% and an adjusted rate of 25%. On cash and liquidity, we ended the year with approximately $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.2 times.","Pro forma for the recent debt raise, which we closed last week on the 13th, our cash balance increased to just under $3 billion. Should Souriau close as expected during our second quarter of FY 2020, we'll receive almost $900 million of cash proceeds and subsequently have the cash balance of just under $4 billion. We also currently have access to about $720 million of our revolver.","Next, on the FY 2020 guidance, I'm going to really quickly give some more details on the financial assumptions around the interest expense, taxes, and then the share count. Interest expense is expected to be about $1.02 billion in FY 2020. This estimate assumes an average LIBOR rate of 1.7% for the full year, which is just an average of the forward consensus curve currently. This yields a weighted average cash interest rate of about 5.5%.","On taxes, our fiscal 2020 GAAP cash and adjusted rates are all expected to be in the 24% to 26% range. We expect our weighted average shares outstanding to increase to $57.4 million from $56.3 million in FY 2019 and that assumes no buybacks occur during the fiscal year. Similar to prior years, the increase in shares outstanding is due to employee stock options that vested at the end of our FY 2019.","With regard to liquidity and leverage at the end of FY 2020 and assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we expect to have roughly $5 billion of cash on hand at the end of the year. This assumes the Souriau divestiture closes as expected. And we estimate our net leverage will be below five times EBITDA as defined at September 30th, 2020.","In closing, we expect fiscal 2020 to be a good year for TransDigm. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to kick-off the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And our first question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Myles Walton","I wonder if you can, maybe, Nick, just tee us off. I know you didn't want to touch on the precision of the deals that may or not be in the pipeline. But just as you look at how open the debt markets have been to you, is it fair to think that you'll have excess liquidity relative to your pipeline that would point you more towards additional special dividends? Or do you think the pipeline is rich enough to satisfy as open as the debt markets are to you right now?","Nick Howley","Yes, I don't -- obviously, I know the question goes there. I don't want to comment on that. I think, as you know, if we have $4 billion at the end of the year, we won't sit on that. I mean we'll do -- either we'll have something significant in the gun sight or we'll do something else. As you know, we'll make some type of return some to the shareholders and we're just -- we're going to delay that decision a little bit.","Myles Walton","Fair enough. And then, Mike or Kevin, I don't know which, on the free cash flow, fiscal 2018 -- sorry, fiscal 2019 came a little light of fiscal 2018. I think you were looking for it to be as good, if not better. I don't know if that's the divested properties. And then also, can you give a comment on your expectation for free cash flow for 2020?","Michael Lisman","Yes. We -- it was a little bit light in FY 2019, and that's mainly a result of about $100 million of cash charges on Esterline, onetime items related to the integration. With regard to FY 2020, the way we look at it generally is that we expect EBITDA less CapEx, less cash interest, less cash taxes to be about 50% of EBITDA. I think we've mentioned the 50% stat to you guys.","Historically, if you looked at FY 2019 and stripped out the Esterline stuff, we hit about 50%, and we expect FY 2020 to be about the same.","Myles Walton","Okay, all right. Thanks. I'll leave at two. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ronald Epstein","Hey good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning Ron.","Ronald Epstein","When you think about potentially deploying some of that capital, are there areas in the portfolio that you think you need more coverage of? I mean is there any clue you can give us? And if you were to do some more M&A, what area would you be covering?","Nick Howley","Yes, I would say our -- what we're looking for is the same thing we're always looking for: proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We're not biased towards one part of an airplane or another part of the airplane or one product or another. If it meets that criteria, and we see a clear path to our private equity-like return, we're a very interested buyer. And I -- we really don't hem it down any more than that.","Ronald Epstein","Got it. Got you. And then maybe just kind of peeling back the onion a little bit. When you think about the return of the 737 MAX into service, is it going to be a headwind or a tailwind? Meaning, there will be fewer older airplanes flying around, which would suggest a headwind. But if it's a new airplane going into service, you'll have provisioning, which would be a possible tailwind, right? So, on balance, how would you expect the return to service there to kind of impact you guys?","Kevin Stein","Yes. Ron, we look at it as somewhat neutral. Of course, the aftermarket's good. The OEM -- we do well with the OEM as a whole on the 737. But as a whole, it's de minimis to the business. It's -- 737 MAX is small enough that the noise of its actual ramp rates, or if anything else difficult happens there, would not have any impact -- noticeable impact on the business. So, I think its de minimis and that's how we model this. Certainly, more older planes flying is good for us, but we have OEM content as well, so it's kind of a push.","Ronald Epstein","Got you. Got you. And then one follow-on to that, if I may. As you mentioned in the prepared remarks, air traffic has slowed a bit this year, right? So, we're maybe a smidge below kind of the long-term mean, but maybe reverting to a mean. But we really haven't seen much impact on aftermarket demand because of that. Are you expecting that to change as we go into next year?","I mean is there some conservative in your outlook for next year because of what air traffic has been doing? I mean how can we think about it? I mean be it that air traffic has slowed pretty much across the industry, everybody has had a booming aftermarket performance.","Kevin Stein","Yes, I think the RPM growth has been impacted by the lack of availability of the 737. So, I don't want to overblow that to the industry and how it may impact us. So, I look at RPM, it's close to the 50-year average. I don't see a looming problem in the industry. So, I'm still optimistic about the future for this market as a whole, whether it's aftermarket or OEM.","I think aftermarket orders can be lumpy at times and we certainly see that. Last year, the POS, which is a nice forward-looking indicator, that was up high single-digits. So, that kind of reinforces how we feel about this year and why we guided to mid to high single-digit growth in the aftermarket. But certainly, we've put necessary conservatism into our forecast, and hence the mid to high comes into play.","Ronald Epstein","Great. Thank you so much,","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good morning guys, it's actually Matt on for David.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to see -- is there any update you guys can share on the Inspector General audit that you mentioned last quarter, to the extent that you can say anything about it? And then also, I think there was this pricing memo over the summer, the DoD was requesting more kind of pricing data. Is it -- are you still getting requests for that data? And is that having any meaningful impact on you?","Kevin Stein","Yes. So, two parts to your question. The IG update. The IG, that is an audit of the DLA and its buying practices of TransDigm-related products. We continue to work closely with the IG. I really don't have an estimate yet of when that will complete, but we're actively engaged and working through. It appears to be a similar scope as prior audits. That's really all I have to update right now, but we are working closely with them.","On the pricing memo, we have met with the DoD directly on this. The pricing memo was put out to hopefully clarify the situation. We're seeing some additional, we would say, pickiness on pricing or costs or different requests for information.","But as a whole, we continue to work closely with the DoD and the DLA on their purchases. There's been a little bit of slowdown on some orders, but as a whole, it hasn't -- we don't see any noticeable impact on the business.","These tend to be small orders, generally speaking, and we are busy -cooperating with the DLA on the fair and reasonable acquisition process that is dictated by rules and laws, and we work within those completely. And so we're cooperating and working closely together and meeting with them directly.","Nick Howley","I might just add, the last couple of times we've had these, they've taken -- Kevin, I would say, 18 to 24 months to complete. I mean so we don't -- I don't know what this one will take, but that -- at least there's a couple of benchmarks.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Yes, that's really helpful. Thanks. And then, I guess, on Esterline. So last quarter, you commented there was some loss-making contract write-up. Can you say what that level was for the quarter and kind of what the level is you'd expect going forward on that?","Michael Lisman","Yes, it was $15 million in Q4. We expect it to continue with that kind of level going out quarterly. The average over the next, say, three, four years should be about, rough, just as $40 million per year, more in the earlier years than in the out years.","Kevin Stein","It's gradually tapering off, right.","Michael Lisman","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Ken Herbert","Hi good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning Ken.","Ken Herbert","I just wanted to ask, Nick or Kevin, in prior periods when you've started to maybe see some cautionary signs in your commercial market or other, maybe reasons for a bit of pessimism on the broader outlook, you've been fairly quick to take action and adjust your cost structure ahead of that. Are you at the point where you might start to think about that? Or is it way too early to think about that?","And if so, what would you want to see specifically? Or how is your outlook near term as you think about some of the clouds you mentioned on the horizon and some of the lower growth we've seen in passenger traffic?","Kevin Stein","Yes. I think, really, your question is how cautious are we on the market and what do we see. We've provided guidance that says -- and our order book, so far, doesn't indicate that we're starting the year on a weak point with our guidance, so I feel okay.","I know Jorge Valladares and I talk about this frequently. We've been together often over the last couple weeks, and it's something we talk about but neither of us see it as something we have to act on this second because the forward-looking indicators, bookings specifically, look decent, look strong. So, I don't think we have to take an adjustment yet, but it is something that we're actively debating so that we don't fall behind.","We recognize that once you fall behind, you can never catch up on productivity. So, we certainly don't want to do that, but we don't want to jeopardize the business and deliveries by making that jump too soon. We continue to discuss, I think, is the answer.","Ken Herbert","Okay, that's helpful, Kevin. And I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around sort of the wind-down of the legacy Esterline corporate office in Bellevue and a lot of the transition to your operating businesses over there to Cleveland. Is it fair to say that you'd have the capacity now and the bandwidth for a larger acquisition? Or do you still feel like there's significant integration around Esterline and sort of realization of the upside that you'd maybe not be as excited near term about a larger deal?","Nick Howley","Yes, I would say we're making very good progress on Esterline. And frankly, it's moved faster than we expected. I don't think -- if we saw the right opportunity, I don't think we'd be reticent to pull the trigger because of bandwidth now, where we're more restricted by the sort of value and where the opportunities might be.","Ken Herbert","Okay, great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it back.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Michael Ciarmoli","Maybe, Nick or Kevin, just on Esterline, I think you said EBITDA margins were running above 30%, and I mean that's come a pretty long way. I think the initial guide was maybe low-20% level. Can you just maybe give us some color on what's really helping to drive the improvement there? I mean maybe even compartmentalize it? I mean is it price, is it getting rid of excess overhead? Is it just implementing better productivity and better execution initiatives?","Kevin Stein","Yes, I think, Michael, the answer is yes to that. We've seen opportunities on productivity, on price. Certainly, better leveraging the overhead structure that we have in place already is important to that. We've continued to see new business wins in this business at Esterline. That's important.","I think one of the most important points is that we reported that we modeled that the aftermarket at Esterline was somewhere around 30%, and that's up from the 12% that was most recently reported when Esterline was a public company. We found that 30% to maybe be a little conservative. It's better than even what we had modeled similar, directionally, to TransDigm.","And so that has been a great reason why we're seeing improvement faster than what we had originally planned. But it's a balance of productivity and price. It's not one thing or the other. We emphasize all areas including new business growth in our improvement.","Nick Howley","The other thing I'd add is -- the only thing I'd add is we -- as I think we continually said when we bought it, our goals are to be fairly conservative in our modeling when we make an acquisition. We don't -- we want to be sure if we're going to give our money away, we have a pretty darn good chance of making it.","Michael Ciarmoli","That better than expected aftermarket exposure, what do you guys attribute that to? I mean, was that just Esterline taking its eye off the ball, not having the systems in place to sort of track the life cycle of their products, not having good turnaround times? I mean anything you can attribute the better than expected 30% exposure?","Kevin Stein","I think we define the market very carefully on aftermarket because we understand how valuable that segment is. So, I think it's largely definitional, and we spent the time combing through the data for those opportunities so that we understood our product mix very well and our market mix.","Nick Howley","And I'd just like repeat the same. Going into something like this, when the data is unclear and we're unsure, we tend to be conservative. Yes.","Kevin Stein","Yes.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Just the last one, maybe housekeeping on capital deployment. But I guess, with the interest expense, where you guys are for fiscal 2020 as a percent of EBITDA, I think the tax law still restricts deductibility at 30%. I mean do you guys have any plans to get that interest expense below that 30% threshold, whether it's paying down?","Nick Howley","No.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay. Got it.","Nick Howley","No, we think of it the same way. The cost of the debt is 5.5% now. So, it's -- depending on how much is or isn't deductible, the after-tax cost is 3.5% to 4.25% or something like that in that range. We always compare that to the cost of our equity on an after-tax basis, which we say we want to give you a PE-like return. So, that still looks pretty good compared to the 15%, 20% PE-like return.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it, perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Greg Konrad","Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Greg Konrad","Overall, in defense, you didn't call out bookings like the other two end markets. I mean what type of activity are you seeing from an order perspective and how do you think about that backlog as we head into 2020?","Kevin Stein","We had a strong bookings year in defense, not as strong as the year before, but our total defense bookings were up in that mid-single-digit range, much like we guided to. That's produced by stronger bookings on the defense OE side and a slowdown in bookings in the aftermarket, which may indicate that maybe some of the sequestration, refilling of spares and maintenance-related activities in the defense sector has been caught up. Time will tell.","Greg Konrad","Thanks. And then just one more. You called out business jet and helicopter aftermarket being up 20% in the quarter. I mean what is driving that, whether it's activity or mandate driven? And what type of visibility are you seeing in that market?","Kevin Stein","Your question was specifically around business jet and helicopter?","Greg Konrad","Exactly.","Kevin Stein","Yes, I think we're surprised, a little bit cautious surprise there about the performance. We certainly don't see the support on the business jet side on the takeoff and landing cycles, which is how we follow and monitor the business, much like all of you. So, we continue to be pleasantly surprised by the strength of the OE and the aftermarket on the business jet defense.","On the helicopter side of the business, I really don't have that much comment. It's a pretty small sector and nothing jumps to mind as worthy of commentary.","Greg Konrad","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And our next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks. Good morning guys.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","Maybe inside the air transport aftermarket numbers, could you give us some granularity on discretionary versus nondiscretionary? Maybe if you saw any differences by region or by channel distribution or direct, any color there?","Kevin Stein","Yes. So, I can give you a little bit by submarkets, like we did earlier. We had -- we saw some strength in the freight area that was largely due to 737 freighter. The -- any weakness we saw in the interior side was largely an artifice of stocking packages that were put in the year before. So, we had big stocking packages for some of our interiors businesses and that just didn't repeat. So that will come out in time.","Business jet continued pretty strong. Our passenger segments of the commercial aftermarket is right on the multiyear average and right about where we expected it to be. So, the segments are performing more or less as we expected.","The freight side has been a pleasant surprise and the interiors is actually -- they're going through a cycle right now. They've recently won a number of international OEM projects on the interiors business as a whole, and that will translate to growth and opportunities for aftermarket in the future. So, I think these are the lumps of some of these submarkets that we see on the aftermarket side.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks Kevin, that's helpful. And just a separate question on -- if you could maybe comment on where you are in the value-based pricing implementation of Esterline's aftermarket. Have you had--?","Kevin Stein","Yes, we don't really talk about it that way. Our value drivers are a constant focus for us. We don't look at it as the journey is complete and we've reached Nirvana. We continue to work these, it's part of our discipline, it's part of our process.","So, we see opportunities ongoing in our legacy TransDigm businesses, just like we see them on the old Esterline side, and we'll actually stop referring to it as the Esterline businesses. It'll just be part of our power, airframe and non-aerospace sectors as we go forward. But that's kind of how we see it.","Gautam Khanna","That's a fair answer, I appreciate it. Maybe asked a better way, of the 30%-plus of Esterline's revenue that is aftermarket, do you have a sense for how much is sort of spot aftermarket or, if you will, off contract?","Kevin Stein","No, I do not. I do not have that knowledge as I sit here, sorry.","Gautam Khanna","That's okay. Thank you very much. appreciate it.","Kevin Stein","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir, your line is open.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Seth Seifman","Nick, I think it was back in like 2011 when you guys took the kind of target return down from 20% to 17.5% at the top and maybe I guess 12.5% down to 10% at the bottom. And I think one of the reasons at that time was the growth in the business, and at that point, it was about $1.2 billion.","Obviously, much, much bigger now and I think you guys have probably exceeded your own and everybody else's expectations. Does that -- now that we're above $6 billion here, does that return framework still work?","Nick Howley","We don't have any -- we do not have any plans to change it now. Well, let me make sure I understand your question. Is your question what do we expect go forward growth in the shares to be? Or is it what do you -- what do we plan to do with our compensation plan?","Seth Seifman","I think the -- well, the compensation plan is intended to reflect I guess the shares, right? And so, let's say the shares then.","Nick Howley","All right. I'll answer both questions anyway. I would say our goal on the shares is we hope to continue to do this, is to give you a private equity-like return. And we define that as somewhere in the 15% to 20% over a long period of time. Each year won't be that. Clearly it's done -- I want to say the growth in the public market for the last, whatever it is, 12 or 13 years has been more like 35%. I don't think that will continue going forward. And our goal is still, as I say, a PE-like return, and we still think that's reasonable to expect.","On the compensation targets, where we -- the 7 -- what the 17.5% roughly is, it's about what top quartile PE funds return. So, we -- and that's how we have targeted through the years. And as we get bigger, it made more sense to look like a top quartile PE fund and that's why we went to the 17.5%. Should that go to 15% someday? I don't know, perhaps, but it's not in the gun sight right now.","Seth Seifman","Got it. Got it. Okay. And then as a follow-up, just to make sure I understand, last quarter without Esterline, it looked like the pro forma of commercial aftermarket contribution to the company was 36% of revenue, and this quarter it's 31%. And so it would seem that the Esterline piece is coming in with below 30% commercial aftermarket. Or is that like an incorrect reading on my part?","Nick Howley","We're not following your math. I'm not sure that's correct. I guess if the Esterline contribution is well below 30%, we know that's not correct.","Seth Seifman","Right. Okay, okay. Okay. I was just looking at the slides from last quarter and this quarter. But maybe two more quick cleanup ones. On the defense piece that's 37% now, what's the rough split there with Esterline and the total TransDigm defense pie between aftermarket and OE?","Kevin Stein","I think it's similar to our commercial business, but that's as much as we guide on that.","Seth Seifman","Right. Okay. Okay. And then the last piece is you talked about $4 billion of cash at year-end. I guess the -- yes, actually I'll leave it there. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Liza Sabol for her final remarks.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. That concludes our call today.

Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Liza Sabol, Ma'am, you may begin.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2019 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.","Before we begin, we would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC.","We'd also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley","Good morning and thanks for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start off with some summary comments on our strategy \u2013 our consistent strategy. A few comments on the second quarter and year-to-date, fiscal 2019, a quick update on the Esterline deal and few other items. Kevin and Mike will then review the business performance and the outlook for fiscal year 2019.","To reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and over three quarters of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which typically have higher margins and provide relative stability in the downturns. Our longstanding goal is to give our shareholders private equity like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. We follow consistent long-term strategies specifically we own and operate aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple well-proven value based operating methodology. Third, we have very decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that is very closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit with our strategy and where we see a clear path to PE like return and lastly, our capital structure and allocation of our capital are key part of our value creation methodology.","Fiscal year 2019 performance continues strong with another good quarter, quarter and year-to-date revenues, our EBITDA As Adjusted dollars and TransDigm based EBITDA margins were up nicely over the prior year. Incoming orders continue strong, especially in the commercial aftermarket and well ahead of shipments across all major market segments, all boding well for the balance of the year.","As you can see, we have increased our base business guidance for the year with an anticipated increase in all major markets. The revised guidance now includes 28 weeks of contribution from the completed Esterline acquisition as well as an increase in base TransDigm revenue and EBITDA guidance.","EPS for fiscal year 2019 is impacted by our capital market decision to raise $4 billion of senior secured notes in order to maintain substantial near-term financial flexibility. Kevin will expand on the quarter and full-year outlook. Our liquidity is strong assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market activity we expect to have about $3 billion of cash at the end of the fiscal year. We also expect to have over 7 million of unused revolver and some additional room under our credit agreement.","We continue to actively evaluate and seek M&A opportunities. We have a decent pipeline of mostly small and midsize possibilities. Again, I cannot predict or comment on possible closings but as I said before, we are still working steadily at M&A and we're still open for business.","A few comments about the Esterline transaction, we closed this transaction in mid-March. As I think you know, we paid about $4 billion for roughly $2 billion in revenue, based on the public consensus information that existed at the time, about 330 million of fiscal year 2019 EBITDA was anticipated. We estimate this as about 12 times EBITDA purchase multiple of the consensus fiscal year 2019 EBITDA.","As we said before, we think Esterline has been a misunderstood company, its core aerospace and defense businesses make makeup around three quarters or more of the revenue. Its core business has proprietary content and sole source positions generally similar as a percent of revenue TransDigm. The core aftermarket also appears significant. We estimate somewhere in excess of 30% of the revenues of the core business.","As you know and as we discussed with the Esterline acquisition, we use an LBO model to value businesses that generally assumes we finance about half debt and about half equity. We then assume we sell the business in five years and look to get a return on our equity of 20% or more without any significant multiple arbitrage. As you know it\u2019s a practical matter, we rarely, if ever sell them after five years. If you do the math on Esterline, this solves to a target EBITDA margin in the low-to-mid-20 range or about an 8% margin expansion. We are still working out the timing on this but it likely won't all happen in the first year. We have owned these businesses for about 55 days now and we see no reason to think that we cannot meet our purchase expectation over time and we see some indications that we may well do better.","In summary, so far it appears the opportunity at Esterline is at least as good. And perhaps better than we originally thought. Kevin will discuss the integration in a little more detail. We are currently actively exploring the sale of certain Esterline assets that don't fit us well with our focus. These could recover something around $1 billion of our purchase price on a pretax basis. We'll decide whether to proceed when we get a better view of the actual prices. We have the flexibility to consider the full range of capital allocation alternatives. We will defer any other 2019 decisions on capital allocation until either late in the third quarter or the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and assess the overall business and capital market environment at that time.","And lastly with respect to the IG report that I mentioned in last quarter. It was publicly posted in substantially the same form as we discussed in our last earning call to reiterate with no assertions of any wrongdoing and request for a $16 million approximate voluntary refund.","As a follow-up to this, Kevin and I along with some other DoD individuals, have been asked to testify at the House Committee on Oversight and Reform in mid-May. The purpose is to discuss the report pricing and possible legislative or regulatory changes. Now let me hand this over to Kevin who will discuss both Q2 and year-to-date 2019 performance as well as the full year guidance.","Kevin Stein","Thanks Nick. Today I will review our results by key markets, then discuss the profitability of the business for the quarter, provide revised fiscal year guidance. Briefly update our org structure and finally give an update on the integration of Esterline. As you've seen, we had a strong quarter in the first half of the year including above average organic growth, Mike will provide more details on the financials for our second quarter operations, specifically revenue and EBITDA As Defined were up nicely over last quarter.","Q2 GAAP revenues were up 28% versus prior year Q2 and EBITDA As Defined was up 24% over the prior year with margins at 48% of revenue. Now we will review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period of 2018. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. Please note this market analysis excludes Esterline. We will begin to include the Esterline acquisition in our market analysis once we have validated the data as we have a different market segmentation process.","In the commercial market, which makes up close to 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. In our commercial OEM market, Q2 revenues increased approximately 10% when compared with Q2 of fiscal year 2018, due to our year-to-date revenue growth of 11% and continued booking strength we are increasing our commercial OEM full year revenue guidance to mid-single-digits growth from our previous guidance of low-to-mid single digit growth.","Please note this increased OEM guidance includes our expected impact from 737 Max groundings and shipping delays. We have done an analysis on the potential impact and conclude the Max issues should not have a material impact on our financials this year and may possibly provide upside to our commercial aftermarket in the future. A nice segue to our commercial aftermarket business discussion.","Total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by just over 6% in the quarter and year-to-date, continued global revenue passenger mile growth and slower retirements of older aircraft, continue to provide a backdrop of improved market dynamics. In the quarter, commercial transport passenger growth of 9% was offset by a slowdown in the commercial transport freight submarket. Bookings coupled with our year-to-date revenue performance versus tough comps in the prior year and strong underlying fundamentals, provide us confidence in the second half of the fiscal year. We are increasing our commercial aftermarket guidance to grow high single-digits from our previous guidance of mid-to-high single digit growth.","Now let me speak about our defense market, which is just over 30% of our total revenue. The defense market which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues was up approximately 18% over the prior year quarter. Last year we reported strong defense bookings that we are now seeing materialize into sales. However, we are expecting defense sales growth to temper in the second half of our fiscal year, following this exceptionally high first half revenue growth and gradually slowing bookings. Due to the higher-than-expected year-to-date sales growth, we are increasing our defense full year revenue guidance to grow high single-digits from our previous guidance of mid-to-high single-digit growth.","Moving to profitability, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. EBITDA As Defined of about $572 million for Q2 was up 24% versus prior Q2, and this includes about $27 million for Esterline, contribution for the 17 days of ownership in the quarter. EBITDA As Defined margin in the quarter was just under 48% of revenues, this includes over 3.5 margin points of acquisition dilution from Esterline and the fiscal year 2018 acquisitions of Kirkhill, Extant and Skandia. This core margin of 51.5% excluding Esterline and other fiscal year 2018 acquisitions, improved approximately 2 points in the quarter over Q2 2018.","Margin improvement progress is always important to us, it indicates that our base businesses continue to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers. We continue our relentless pursuit of value generation.","Turning now to 2019 guidance. We are increasing our sales and EBITDA guidance to reflect the strong first half results of our base business and to incorporate Esterline for about 6.5 months of ownership for the balance of the fiscal year. The midpoint of our fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance is now $5.44 billion, an increase of $1.25 billion, this revenue guidance is based on the revised market channel growth rate assumptions we just discussed for TransDigm\u2019s base business, plus the inclusion of Esterline revenue, which reflects 6.5 months of ownership.","The midpoint of fiscal year 2019 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now $2.35 billion, an increase of $255 million with an expected margin of around 43%. About 20% of this increase is related to performance at our base business with a remainder attributed to Esterline, excluding Esterline the full year margin is expected to be around 50%. We are slightly increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $16.81 per share. Mike will discuss in more detail shortly.","Now before I speak about the Esterline acquisition integration, I wanted to briefly update you on our organization structure. Jorge Valladares, who has been with TransDigm for over 20 years has been promoted to TransDigm\u2019s Chief Operating Officer and he\u2019s now responsible for all operations of the base TransDigm business. Jorge most recently served as our COO of our Power and Control segment.","Now moving on to Esterline integration and expectations, the Esterline integration has been progressing to plan over the first 55 days of TransDigm ownership. To date, we have seen no material differences to opportunity identified in our acquisition model. As you know, we have an experienced team of TransDigm executives, both EVPs and group controllers engaged full time in this integration. They have been carved out so they have little or no day-to-day TransDigm responsibilities. The former corporate office in Bellevue, Washington has been closed. This should complete by calendar year end. We are phasing the workforce reductions in Bellevue to minimize disruptions and risks.","In general, the platform organization structure has been eliminated and aligned with our TransDigm. Each of the former Esterline operating units have been assigned to a TransDigm EVP. And we have TransDigm group controllers assigned to these operating units to provide financial reporting support. We are now going through the process of reviewing the operating units and determining where value generation opportunities may exist. Again, no surprises have been seen in these early days.","Culturally, we continue to press the concept of thinking and acting like an owner with the President and senior staff of the operating units. This supports the execution of our value generation concepts. So far so good for the integration. Although, we did include Esterline in our fiscal year 2019 guidance, we are not providing guidance beyond this fiscal year at this time, due to uncertainty around what businesses we may keep or sell. As nick mentioned, we are exploring the sale of certain assets that do not fit our strategic focus, but guidance for fiscal year 2019 assumes no assets sales.","In summary, we are excited to have acquired Esterline and look forward to reporting our integration process to you in the future. We were also enthusiastic about the second half of our fiscal year as underlying fundamentals remain strong.","With that, I will now turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.","Mike Lisman","Thanks, Kevin. I'll give a quick review of the financial results and the updated guidance in more detail. First for the TransDigm base business and then second for the TransDigm plus Esterline entity. And for those following along, I'm on Slide 4 in today's deck. The following sales EBITDA and EPS comparisons exclude the impact of both the 17 days of Esterline ownership that fell into the quarter and then also the new debt financing.","Second quarter net sales were up 15% versus the prior year and above average organic growth of 11% drove the majority of that increase. EBITDA As Defined increased 18% from the prior year second quarter. And our adjusted EPS for the second quarter would have been $4.63 per share, which would have been an increase of 22%. Again, the $4.63 is what adjusted EPS would have been had we not purchased Esterline, so it's a theoretical number.","Now switching gears and including Esterline. Esterline contributed about $121 million of revenue and $27 million of EBITDA to our Q2. This implies an EBITDA margin of 22% which is higher than average, due to the elevated shipments level that happens at quarter end. The Esterline EBITDA margin over the last six months of our fiscal 2019 is not expected to be quite this high. On cash and liquidity, we ended the quarter with just over $2.4 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet. Our forecasted cash balance at year end is just under $3 billion and that excludes any more acquisition activities, sales of Esterline assets, dividends or share repurchases.","During the quarter, we completed the raising and the funding of the $4 billion of senior secured notes. We raised more debt than we needed to in order to fund the deal, as we had a relatively high cash balance already. We opted to do this because the debt came at an attractive rate and it also permitted us to keep significant cash available.","With the new debt raise, our net debt leverage ratio increased from what would have been 5.2 times for the base TransDigm business at second quarter end to 6.1 times for the new pro forma entity. This change to our debt and leverage levels muddies and confuses the year-over-year EPS comparisons. And the punchline is that you don't see as much EPS growth as you do EBITDA growth because of this higher debt race.","How do we not elected to do the higher debt raise and increase our net leverage? The inclusion of Esterline would have had a larger positive impact on adjusted EPS growth for the year. For example, had we taken on only $2 billion of incremental debt and financed the remaining $2 billion with cash, adjusted EPS for fiscal 2019 would have been more than one full dollar higher than the midpoint of the new guidance. Now (20:22) changes to our expected tax rates for the year. These rates have increased from the prior guidance of 21% to 23% and the increase is driven by the fact that we are over the interest deduction limitation that's part of the new U.S. federal tax law. We're now estimating our full year GAAP and cash tax rates to be about 24% to 25% and adjusted rate to be about 26%.","As Kevin mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $16.81 and this revised guidance for the year doesn't assume any sales of Esterline business units or Esterline EBITDA during the rest of the year.","With that, I'll hand it back over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol","Thanks Mike. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines. But first, I just want to remind all of our investors to keep your questions to two and then please re-enter yourself back into the queue to allow an opportunity for all to ask a question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Q - Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning everyone.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Esterline as a standalone had something in the zone of $70 million of corporate, give or take. How much of that hangs around with you?","Mike Lisman","Let me try it, you mean \u2013 I guess we'd try that a couple of ways, Noah. How much hangs around with us if you look out a year or so, very little. When it goes away is sort of a phasing, as Kevin talked about, because we don't want to disrupt things until we feel comfortable we're all backfilled. But I think almost everyone in the corporate office there \u2013 almost everyone in the corporate office there \u2013 almost everyone now has a scheduled out termination date.","Kevin Stein","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And the \u2013 it looks like the margin implied for the Esterline business in the back half of 2019 in your new guidance. And if I strip out what you said was organic and then consistent with your comments, Nick, on the (22:56) percentage points of improvement, it's something in the zone of 17%. It looks like that might actually be down year-over-year based on how you're defining it. Is it? Are you assuming that, that is kind of flat to down year-over-year?","Mike Lisman","No. I don't think it's down. I think your math is directionally accurate, but I think that that's actually up from prior year.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Yes. I guess where I'm going at that is I'm looking at the 3.19 of EBITDA that you disclosed, which would be a 15.7% margin. And I know it was a pretty back-end loaded margin, so that's why I was assuming that maybe that was down or, I guess, in the zone of flat. And while I very much appreciate that a lot of the actions you will implement here will take time, and integration takes time. I would have thought there'd be some pretty quick initial upfront cost actions, and I know you guys usually take some pricing actions pretty quickly. So I was just wondering if there's something different about this that makes some of those initial upfront actions slower?","Kevin Stein","I think not any different than other acquisitions. It always takes time for the contracts to play out before you can address any pricing or cost-reduction initiatives. It does take time. And that's what we're trying to communicate here.","Nick Howley","And I guess I might also add, Noah, that we could be \u2013 we will tend to lean on the conservative side here until we get more comfortable with the forecasting ability of all the individual operating units.","Noah Poponak","Yes. Makes sense given its size. Just one other question on it and then I'll leave it, which is you've mentioned that the opportunity set is no different than you thought initially. How does the opportunity set compare to Kirkhill? Does total Esterline have as much margin opportunity as you found in Kirkhill?","Nick Howley","Let me \u2013 Kirkhill started negative. So surely, the \u2013 I mean just to be facetious, surely the rate of change can't be as high.","Noah Poponak","Yes. Forget rate of change, but just the absolute level you took it to.","Nick Howley","I don't want to cut out one individual operating unit. I think I gave you about what our thoughts are on Esterline. And I think, hopefully, Noah, we gave you some sense that we \u2013 as we're into it a little bit, we think it's more likely a little better than a little worse than we thought.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate all the details you gave us on the prepared remarks. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, team.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Just a couple of quick ones. One, with respect to the percent aftermarket that you had talked about for Esterline in the past, I think it was \u2013 you pinned that around 30%. Now that you've maybe gotten a bit of a better look, does that number change at all? And then within that number, how should we envision the split there between A and D?","Nick Howley","What\u2019s A and B?","Kevin Stein","What\u2019s A and B?","Carter Copeland","Between civil and military. Sorry.","Kevin Stein","Yes. I don't know the aftermarket split, and we haven't finalized our number. I think a 30% or a little more is probably a good number. And remember, that's the core business ex after we have either dispositioned or separated out the ones that we don't think fit as well. I would say in the split there between commercial and defense, I just don't know. But it's just \u2013 not that I'm avoiding it. I just don't know what the exact split is. But I would say, in total, the defense content is a little less than TransDigm's. Not a lot less but a little less.","Carter Copeland","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then with respect to the cost structure, if you exclude out Sorio or whatever those assets are, what is \u2013 how much of that cost structure that remains is European? Is that a significant number?","Nick Howley","Do you mean how much of the businesses are European?","Carter Copeland","Yes. How much of Esterline, excluding those assets that we're talking about, when you look at how much of that cost structure is still based in Europe since that's clearly a\u2026","Nick Howley","A fair slot. There's still \u2013 I don't want to opine on who we are and aren't going to sell. But there's still \u2013 there's a fair number of businesses, and taking one out of it won't make it go away. There's still some decent-sized businesses that are in Europe that we'd, in all likelihood, hang on to.","Carter Copeland","Okay. All right, thanks for the color guys. I\u2019ll let somebody else ask.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Spingarn","Hey, good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn","Nick, just on that last question. Can you give us anything about the targeted divestitures' magnitude, not necessarily separate businesses.","Nick Howley","Well, I think I did give you \u2013 I gave you a rough dollar value of \u2013 the dollar value we think we might get back. And that was about $1 billion, pre- tax, if we go ahead with everything we have in the queue. Now I don't know whether we'll go ahead with that until we see the prices. But you can figure \u2013 if it works and we like the prices and if we get somewhere around what we think, we may sell up to about $1 billion.","Mike Lisman","That\u2019s pre-tax.","Nick Howley","Pre-tax\u2026","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then this might be for Mike, I don't know, but with regard to Esterline EBITDA trending over time, I think you said earlier, you talked about mid-20s. You talked about the fact that the latest quarter was a bit higher than it has been for shipment reasons, shipment timing. How do we think about the cadence of margin improvement at Esterline, how long it takes and what the rate of change is there? You've said in the past, you probably don't get to TransDigm heritage margins, but how do we think about this on a two, three year basis?","Mike Lisman","I think Nick gave kind of the margin ramp at the outset, and we're pretty conservative on the internal modeling assumptions we've used. So we didn't have it going up to the levels that Nick outlined in year one, as he said. It was more over several years.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Can you put any more color around that, Mike, just to refresh us and now that you've been in the business for a couple of months?","Mike Lisman","Yes. We\u2019ve got a lot of got a lot of moving parts with potential divestitures, and I don't want to commit to anything now, going out couple of years.","Nick Howley","And Rob, we\u2019ll give the \u2013 next year we\u2019ll give the guidance, When we give it, it'll be much more specific then.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just a clarify. You\u2019ve been running at 52 per month on the MAX. You haven't slowed down at all?","Kevin Stein","We have not slowed down.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Robert Stallard","A couple of questions on the core business. First of all, defense. You had a very strong first half, and you're expecting that to slow down in the second. What do you think has caused this outsized growth in the second half? And what's changed \u2013 sorry, the first half. And what's changing in the second half of the year?","Kevin Stein","Yes. We saw strong order growth in both the OEM and aftermarket in \u2013 last year. And I think that's coming out now in our shipments. We are just seeing the orderbook slowdown in both OEM and defense. Maybe it's inventory timing. We don't know of any programs or any other slowdown. So we would normally say inventory adjustments in the supply chain for that. But the slowdown is in both OEM and aftermarket as we look at that going forward from an orderbook point of view.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And then moving on to the aftermarket. I think the oil price is up about 40% or 45% year-over-year. Have you seen any of your airline customers adjusting their utilization patterns or their spares buying or anything like that based on the high oil price?","Kevin Stein","We are not seeing that we have noticed any adjustments in buying activity or patterns because of high fuel or not. We haven't seen any pattern change.","Robert Stallard","So you're still seeing the older aircraft heavily utilized, right?","Kevin Stein","Absolutely. The reports on the NG are that they've definitely ramped up usage.","Robert Stallard","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Your line is now open, sir.","David Strauss","Thanks for taking the question. So I think going back to Rob's question on this, Nick, the low to mid-20% EBITDA margins that you outlined. Were you saying that that's kind of the target that you need to get to, to hit your entire rate of return? Or that's what you think is achievable over the next couple of years.","Nick Howley","Yes. That's what we use. That's what we use sort of the value of the business. It was running \u2013 and you can easily, as I'm sure you have, you can back into that easily enough. You know the assumptions we use. And the business was running somewhere around 15% EBITDA. And if you solved back through our math, you'd get to 23-ish or 22% to 24%. And that's all we're saying. And if we look at it, as I said, today, we see no reason to think that's not doable, and if anything, we feel, a little better. That's what we're saying.","David Strauss","Yes. Okay. And then the \u2013 you talked about selling potentially assets that could bring in $1 billion. How do you think about dilution there and using the cash proceeds to potentially offset the dilution from selling these assets?","Nick Howley","We really haven't decided yet. We'll sort of cross that bridge when we come to it. We have a fair amount of cash now, and this would just make even more. And we'll decide that when we get there. I don't want to start counting the chickens before they're hatched.","David Strauss","Okay. You think you can get to the multiple at which these assets are currently kind of embedded at your current multiple?","Nick Howley","I think we can, depending on the businesses. Some of them may not be the most attractive. I think we can get \u2013 when you weight it all up, I think we can get close. I doubt we can get all the way there. And by that, I'm using the multiple of the 2019 public guidance.","David Strauss","Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Myles Walton from UBS. Your line is now open.","Myles Walton","Thanks, good morning. First one, in terms of the Esterline versus the core business, how are you seeing bookings trending there? And if you'd look organically just at Esterline as if you had owned it in both periods, what kind of growth are you implying in the new guidance that's inclusive?","Kevin Stein","I don't have any comment on the organic growth part of the guidance. I think the orderbook looks strong. It looks as good as TransDigm does right now as a base. So we're seeing strong bookings growth on the Esterline side as well.","Nick Howley","I think in the segments, Kevin, you don't feel comfortable yet, breaking them out yet, until we get a better analysis of that.","Kevin Stein","Because they used a different methodology to calculate aftermarket, and those differences are important to us to understand. We're going through that process right now.","Myles Walton","Okay. But from a standpoint of mid-single-digit, it sounds like it's growing organically about the same as TransDigm right now. Probably on the units it doesn't have the benefit yet of price, is that fair?","Kevin Stein","I think, guys, until we start reporting their metrics the same way that we do ours at TransDigm, we don't want to get crossed up on this until we get it right.","Myles Walton","Okay. All right. And Mike on the\u2026","Nick Howley","There is no reason to think \u2013 There's on reason to think \u2013 there's nothing we see that concerns us. That the\u2026","Kevin Stein","That\u2019s right.","Nick Howley","That the business is something, flawed or\u2026","Myles Walton","Okay. And then, Mike, on the tax rate, this 26% implied for the second half. Is that \u2013 given you've tripped the line from a deductibility perspective, is that fair to use going forward on an adjusted tax rate basis?","Mike Lisman","As we delever, it should tick down a little bit just through EBITDA growth based on how the U.S. tax law works. But if you had to have something to plug into a model, I think 25%, 26% is probably fair, but hopefully, as we delever, it comes down.","Myles Walton","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Ken Herbert","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Ken Herbert","Kevin, I just wanted to start off on the commercial aftermarket. And I know you've talked about this in the past, but for the base TransDigm business, the strong bookings year-to-date. Can you just remind what percent of that business you would associate as sort of book-and-ship, relative to sort of the up 20 year-to-date on bookings, relative to the sales growth and how we should think about that \u2013 how much is captured in the second half of 2019 versus what spills into 2020 and beyond?","Kevin Stein","I think we \u2013 the bulk of aftermarket business is book-and-ship. There is some of it that gets booked out in advance, but the majority of it is book-and-ship even within the quarter. So \u2013 and we gave revised guidance on the market segments that we raised to the high single digits for the commercial aftermarket. So that\u2019s what we see coming out. We have the confidence that the orderbook is in place for the second half. And possibly some of that will translate into next year, but we'll give guidance on next year when we're ready on that. It'll take a little bit of time to pull that together, especially with the complexity of Esterline. We want to make sure that we have a good handle on the data here as we're looking at it for the first time on some of the market segmentation pieces, trying to understand where it's going. Does that answer your question? Directionally at least?","Ken Herbert","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Yes, directionally that\u2019s very helpful. Yes, I mean I saw you raise guidance and the bookings were a key part of that. Are you getting a sense at the airlines that they are building any inventory? Or do you get a sense that there's any change just with the profitability at the airlines, that they've sort of reversed course from what may have been some destocking or do you sort of see inventory levels there steady? I guess, what are you seeing in the marketplace in terms of the airlines and their buying patterns and inventory?","Kevin Stein","The buying patterns are always perplexing. They go up and down quarter-to-quarter. We must have seen some destocking as we're seeing orders pick up again, larger than what you might have anticipated. So there must have been some out there. But I do not get reports \u2013 regular reports on airline stocking. I do see stocking levels at distribution. That is not up. That's somewhat flat. POS is up about 16% across the ranch for the TransDigm base company. So it would appear that there's been some destocking out there that we're seeing addressed in the booking levels for the aftermarket. That's about the extent of the intelligence I can provide on it.","Ken Herbert","That\u2019s helpful. Great, I\u2019ll stop there. Thank you.","Kevin Stein","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thank you.","Kevin Stein","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","Regarding Esterline \u2013 good morning, I was curious, on Esterline, when you look at their standalone SG&A plus R&D, as a percentage of their sales, it was just over 20%, low 20s. Is there anything structurally, now that you've owned the business, that prevents that to being \u2013 that level being closer to what TransDigm's legacy SG&A plus R&D is as a percentage of sales? Like, could it actually get down to the 12%-ish level?","Nick Howley","I think the best thing to focus on is the EBITDA percent we give you. If you start to take out the pieces of manufacturing costs versus SG&A versus R&D, the method of accounting isn't always consistent between companies. So that you can end up with getting funny answers if you start to look at them that way. I focus on EBITDA as a present of sales then you know you captured everything.","Gautam Khanna","Fair enough, I appreciate it. And then just another one, if you don't mind, on the defense side, were there any large lumpy kind of \u2013 sometimes in the past you've called out just big products in the quarter or a big order and that kind of\u2026","Nick Howley","Yes, we have pulled out large parachute orders, missile orders. Yes, you're right. I looked for those, and I could not find any onetime, large orders on the defense side. In fact, some were \u2013 yes, they just weren't there. So it was nicely spread across the business. Not a lot of big onetimes for a certain program.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you guys. So I wanted to go back to Esterline. Nick, you've been pretty clear you target a 20% IRR, which means\u2026","Nick Howley","I can't hear you very well, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Can you hear me better?","Nick Howley","Okay. But you\u2019re\u2026","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay\u2026","Nick Howley","It\u2019s very faint \u2013 faint, yeah\u2026","Sheila Kahyaoglu","I promise I'm yelling. So in terms of Esterline, you guys target 20% returns, which means 22% EBITDA margins. I mean just going back to it, and I apologize I'm parsing this apart, but you strip out the corporate from Q2 2018 EBITDA and margins are still up 700 basis points to 800 basis points year-over-year. I get it you've only owned it for 17 days. So perhaps, outside of corporate, what's really changed since you've owned this asset?","Nick Howley","Sheila, I just don\u2019t follow the math. So I don't \u2013 I can't.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","I guess you only owned it for \u2013 you only owned the asset for 17 days, and margins are still up\u2026","Mike Lisman","I think, Sheila, the margin you're seeing in the 17 days of ownership was an elevated shipment towards quarter end. So you're getting \u2013 you're seeing it at higher EBITDA margin than you would over a longer time horizon because of the elevated\u2026","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Yes. So it's just the lumpiness of that and then you get\u2026","Mike Lisman","Exactly\u2026","Nick Howley","Yeah, I wouldn't use that as a base. I would use the EBITDA that it was running when we bought it, which was somewhere around 15, 15.5-ish\u2026","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay. And then just on the core business with the commercial OE up pretty strongly. How do we think about transport versus business jet for the second half of the year? Thank you.","Nick Howley","I think both seem reasonably strong on the commercial OE side. So both are seeing decent sales bookings in both business jet and commercial transport.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Is there one specific platform in biz jet that's driving the, I think, 20% growth or broad based?","Nick Howley","I don\u2019t have that. I can get you that. I think it\u2019s\u2026","Sheila Kahyaoglu","No worries.","Nick Howley","It\u2019s indicative of the industry as a whole. I didn't call out anything on business jet as it's kind of small. But I think we've seen strength in the large platforms on business jet, really, across the board. Somewhat surprising, I guess given the dynamics of the industry takeoff and landing cycles. So remain cautious on business jet and the platforms, but the orders are coming in.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay, well, thank you.","Nick Howley","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning.","Nick Howley","Good morning.","Seth Seifman","I wanted to touch on the base business and just the EBITDA rate \u2013 quarterly EBITDA rate for the second half of the year. It doesn't really seem like it's much improved versus what you just put up in the second quarter. And given the increase, the acceleration you're looking for in commercial aftermarket. Just wondering if you could address that and whether there's potential for upside or what might be weighing on that sequential improvement.","Nick Howley","I think we're being conservative. I think a little bit conservative there. Mike is nodding his head at me. I don't know what else to say beyond that. We raised the segment pieces. The orderbook is strong. The second half will come in. Mike, do you have anything else to add on?","Mike Lisman","Yeah, I think, Kevin hit it. It could be conservative.","Liza Sabol","And you also have bench we expect that to\u2026","Mike Lisman","Yeah, that\u2019s right. The defense \u2013 we have commented, Liza's correct. We have commented that we're expecting the defense business to moderate slightly so that'll have an impact, subtle. But so that's where we came up with the margin mix for the second half.","Seth Seifman","Sure. And then as a follow-up, Mike, did Esterline have long-term loss-making contracts? And if so, if those got stepped up in purchase accounting, how do you account for those earnings and adjustments?","Mike Lisman","Yes, under purchase price accounting rules, we have basically nine months to sort that outpost acquisition. So we're working through that stuff now.","Seth Seifman","Right, but do you anticipate adjusting it out?","Mike Lisman","We don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019re working through it.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Well, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Spingarn","Hey, guys. Can you hear me?","Nick Howley","Yes.","Robert Spingarn","Okay, just wanted to go back to the defense comments that you made earlier on the investigation, et cetera. Could you just remind us of your direct and indirect exposure or channels on the military business so that we can just have an understanding of the context for this?","Nick Howley","Yes. Our direct \u2013 our sales to the U.S. government depending on the year, run somewhere between 6% and 8% of our total revenue. And that's a combination of direct or through distributors. So let's say seven for kind of the middle ground. If you took seven, it's \u2013 I want to say it's roughly five direct and two through distributors.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thanks for the clarification.","Nick Howley","That's after the \u2013 it's about the same. Yes, it's pretty close to what it was when we did \u2013 when we talked about this a lot a year and a half ago.","Robert Spingarn","Well, and that\u2019s I brought it up because if there are going to be some changes to how maybe some of this business is conducted \u2013 and I don't know if you can elaborate on any of that. I just wanted to understand how much of the business it could impact?","Nick Howley","So you have the idea. What if any changes there are, I have no ability, Rob, to speculate on that or I think those tended to be lengthy processes\u2026","Robert Spingarn","Understood...","Mike Lisman","Yes, I think that's the key. It's a lengthy process.","Robert Spingarn","Right, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open.","Jason Rodgers","Yes, I think last quarter you mentioned some softness in the discretionary interiors market. I'm wondering if you saw the growth rebound in that market and just discuss the condition there.","Kevin Stein","Yeah, we did a little bit. Still, I would say in general the interior side is just doing okay. It's just not a glowing bright light for us, but it's doing okay. In the quarter, our transport, commercial transport submarket was \u2013 did well. I think I said 9%. Interiors, okay. Freight was the low one, though. That's what brought the composite down to 6% for the whole. And that was somewhat anticipated. We've seen the slowdown in the freight market for a little while. So it was somewhat anticipated that we would start to see things back off there.","Jason Rodgers","And is it possible to provide an estimate or a range for what you think the intangible amortization expense may be for fiscal 2019?","Mike Lisman","I think we've put a chart of our best guess in the slide deck for today. I think its Page 17. And that\u2019s subject to change due to purchase price accounting.","Jason Rodgers","Okay, thank you, got it.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Noah Poponak","Hey, have you quantified the year-to-date bookings growth in the defense business the same way you did the over 20 in the commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket?","Mike Lisman","Yes, we haven\u2019t \u2013 I think we haven't said that.","Noah Poponak","Do you have that number?","Mike Lisman","No, we haven\u2019t said that. No\u2026","Nick Howley","The cat ate that one though, we can't find it.","Kevin Stein","I think we \u2013 in the quarter, we have seen bookings in the defense come down in the second quarter. And we're slightly better than flat year-over-year now. So bookings have definitely come down from where they were which was high-teens in the first quarter, now were just up a little bit, not flat up a little bit, but the order book has definitely cooled off on the defense side.","Noah Poponak","So the mid-teens organic and the first half you're clearly saying not sustainable in the back half, how should I think about high single for the year being sustainable or not beyond 2019?","Kevin Stein","Hi, sorry. No, high-single-digit organic growth for the whole business, you mean?","Noah Poponak","Yes, for the defense business.","Kevin Stein","No. Can you repeat your question?","Noah Poponak","Yes, I guess what I'm wondering is, you've had three quarters in a row here of a double digit growth rate organically in the defense business, the orders were outpacing that, they've slowed, but the end market is still a pretty supportive and it looks like multiple pieces of the end market that are more specific to your business are growing faster than the total end-market. So I'm trying to triangulate all of that into thoughts on sustainability of growing that business, high-single-digits annually beyond 2019.","Kevin Stein","I think given the order book slow down, I would think that, that would be difficult to think that that's going to continue to grow at that pace into next year. It might, but I haven't formulated next year's guidance thoughts yet. But we still have some time to see how the rest of the year comes in. The defense bookings tend to be longer term than other business segments that we have. We've talked about that in the past, that bookings can take a very long time to come out. We saw that over the last couple of years that our bookings took a longer than folks anticipated to come out.","But, as I look forward, I think carrying a high-single-digit percentage growth in defense probably will be difficult going forward. But that's, I think a standard observation for the defense business. It tends to go through cycles.","Mike Lisman","I think, I would just add on the bookings. I don't think you can draw much from a quarterly booking number in the defense world. They tend to bounce all over the place, on a year-to-date basis which might be a little longer-term and might be a little more indicative. We continue to book ahead of the shipments.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Yes,","Mike Lisman","That's another way \u2013 another way to think about it.","Noah Poponak","I guess, I could see the thought process around how single, maybe isn't very long-term sustainable in the defense market, but we have a sense for what your pricing is in that market. So the units in high single would be low-to-mid single and looks like outlays are compounding much faster than that. So that was the genesis of the question. But on the cash flow, since you have in the past quantified an EBITDA in conversion, I think you even gave a number on free cash earlier in the year, any update there now with Esterline in the numbers?","Kevin Stein","I think it doesn't change much. You notice in this quarter was lower probably and the reason that is, because of the timing for the quarters, we had double tax payments and double interest payments.","Noah Poponak","Okay. So is the right interpretation of that, there is Esterline cash flow added to the year, but it's offset by kind of non-recurring things associated with bringing Esterline in, is that what you're saying?","Nick Howley","You are talking about getting to the $3 billion, is that right?","Noah Poponak","I'm just talking about the updated full-year 2019 cash flow forecast.","Kevin Stein","I'm sorry, I'm not sure I'm understanding your question, it's basically \u2013 I think if you back into it, we're expecting to generate about 600 million from the combined business in the back half of the year to get to the $3 billion cash balance at year-end.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Kevin Stein","And that's close to 50% of EBITDA for the rest of the year.","Noah Poponak","Great. It would bring that conversion sub-50 for the full year though. But it sounds like that some of the items you just mentioned in the quarter\u2026","Kevin Stein","Yes. Yes. Esterline is not going to convert as much. It doesn't change the math very much. But I think, historically, if you rack this up and gone between 46%, 47% and 50% and we don't expect that to change much going forward.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Alright. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Will for Hunter. How does the deal pipeline compare relative to last quarter? You mentioned taking on more debt than needed for greater flexibility. Are you seeing more or better prospects or does this suggest some other capital deployment strategies in the back half of the year?","Mike Lisman","I'm sorry, can you repeat that question?","Unidentified Analyst","Sure. So how does the deal pipeline compared to last quarter, you mentioned taking on more debt to finance Esterline for great flexibility. Are you seeing better prospects or more prospects out there or does this suggest some other capital deployment strategies in second half of the year?","Kevin Stein","I don't know that it's substantially different, I mean, as I said, we're still open for business and more kind of things. We'll decide that as I said later in the year, we just haven't made a determination yet.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just one other one, how much the underlying TransDigm gross margins improve year-over-year if we exclude all acquisitions in the slide deck you mentioned improved by a 100 basis points excluding Esterline but that includes the other acquisitions.","Mike Lisman","I think Kevin you gave \u2026","Kevin Stein","I gave \u2026.","Mike Lisman","3.5%","Unidentified Analyst","I think you mentioned 200 basis points but that was EBITDA.","Liza Sabol","Yes, that's what we gave. It was EBITDA.","Kevin Stein","Yes, we gave EBITDA.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Do you have that for gross margins?","Liza Sabol","So you'll see when we file the Q, you can find more detail on the gross profit.","Kevin Stein","Which we'll file today, right?","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Liza Sabol. You may begin.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you. Welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; Chief Operating Officer of our Power Group, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. Details are contained in this morning's press release in our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, now let me turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning and thanks to everybody for calling in. Today as usual, I'll start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview then of fiscal year 2016, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance for the year. Kevin is then going to update you on some operating items and Terry will run through the financials for the quarter.","To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, that is, products for which we own the intellectual property. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.","Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margin, TransDigm has, year-in and year-out, generated very strong free cash flow, this gives us lots of operating and financial flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have a well-proven value-based operating strategy, based on our three value driver concept. We maintain a decentralized organization structure, and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders.","We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to PE or private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. We basically have four. First, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy, and these two are almost always our first choices. Third is to give extra money back to the shareholders, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly is to pay off debt. But given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice.","Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the equity returns.","Now, to update you on a few items from this quarter. The credit markets, at least as of today, have firmed up nicely in the last quarter. Our bonds and secured debt are trading roughly at par. We have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent with those we pay now. In the first six months of the year, we bought back about 1 million shares of TransDigm stock at an average price of $205 a share. Almost all of this occurred in the December through February timeframe. We currently have an additional $340 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything about our buyback plans.","At 4\/2\/2016, which is the end of the quarter, based on current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity and maintaining significant liquidity after we do that. This capacity grows as the year proceeds.","On a very positive note, the commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings picked up substantially this quarter. Quarterly bookings ran ahead of the strong shipments. Recoveries are often not straight upward lines and we could still see bumps, but it's good to see a strong quarter like this. As I've said before, we see a number of factors that should contribute to continuing commercial transport aftermarket growth this year. Passenger traffic remains strong, slowdown in retirements, and potential ends to the deferral or inventory cycle. On the other hand, though much smaller in our revenues, the business jet and freighter aftermarkets could be weakening.","Turning to Q2 fiscal year 2016 and year-to-date performance, and I remind you this is the second quarter for 2016, our year started October 1. As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be impacted by differences in mix, inventory fluctuations, seasonality and things like that. Total company GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong, both for the Q2 and year-to-date. For Q2, the revenues were up 29% versus the prior Q2, and 24% versus the prior year-to-date. EBITDA As Defined was up about the same percent as the revenues.","Overall, organic revenues were up in the 4% to 5% range versus the prior year. Commercial revenues were up a bit more, while defense was modestly down. Defense bookings on the other hand ran well ahead of the shipments. EBITDA As Defined dollars and margin percent were both strong.","To review the revenues by market category, again, this is on a pro forma or same-store kind of a basis versus the prior year. And this is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were about flat for Q2 versus both the prior year, year-to-date, and versus the prior year Q2.","Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the vast majority of our commercial OEM revenues, are up 2% versus the prior year-to-date, Q2 was flat versus a difficult comp in the prior year. We saw some modest inventory adjustments in certain commercial transport OEM Tier 1 accounts. Year-to-date, commercial transport bookings are running slightly ahead of revenues. The biz jet and helicopter OEM revenues are a much smaller percent of our business and are heavily biz jet weighted.","In total, revenues in these markets were about flat versus the prior year Q2, and due to the weak Q1, down about 6% year-to-date. Business jet bookings for Q2 were slightly ahead of shipments. The biz jet market in total seems a little weaker than we originally anticipated.","Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 13% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, the commercial transport aftermarket is now up a little more than the overall average and the business jet, helicopter and freighter markets are flat to slightly down.","For the quarter, total commercial aftermarket bookings were modestly above shipments. Commercial transport bookings were up 16% in Q2 versus the prior Q2; biz jet, helicopter and other bookings were modestly down in Q2 versus the prior year Q2. But I'd remind you again, these other categories are far smaller than the commercial transport. The defense aftermarket makes up about 30% of our revenue. Defense revenues for fiscal year 2016 Q2 were down 3% versus the prior Q2, and down about 1% on a year-to-date basis.","The revenues by product lines were spotty with no clear patterns. However, as I said before, year-to-date bookings are running ahead of shipments, they're running about 11% ahead of shipments with a very strong quarter of bookings in Q2.","Moving on to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q2 were non-cash compensation expense and acquisition-related costs or amortizations. EBITDA As Defined of about $396 million for Q2 was up 28% versus the prior quarter \u2013 prior Q2, and $688 million, or up 23%, on a year-to-date basis. The EBITDA As Defined margin was 46.5% of the revenue for Q2, and 46% year-to-date. This is about the same margin percents as last year in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.","As we mentioned last quarter, we've reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in Q1, this, combined with our other value drivers, contributes to the strong margins. With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities, the pipeline of near-term possibilities strengthened from the last quarter and we are seeing more activity recently. Closings are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I've said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see increasing variability in various industry forecasts and by platform, the news is somewhat mixed.","In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well and as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact demand. As I also said, that biz jet and freighter markets could be a little softer than we originally anticipated, recoveries don't always run in a straight line, so we tend to be a little cautious. All in all, this is our best estimate for the full year.","Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions, beyond Breeze, in fiscal year 2016, the guidance is as follows. The midpoint of the 2016 revenue guidance is $3.17 billion, this is the same as our prior guidance. We've tightened the range up a little, it's up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.46 billion, an increase of about $25 million. This is up 18% year-over-year. The increase in guidance is driven by improvements in our EBITDA margin.","The base business, that is excluding the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49%, or up around 2 points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses. The recent acquisition margins are running a bit ahead of our prior estimates. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $11.16 per share, or up $0.39 a share from our last guidance. This is up 24% versus prior year. The increase in guidance is due to two factors, improved margins and modestly lower share count as a result of our buybacks. Terry will run through some of the details.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket growth in the mid to high single-digits. We're still somewhat cautious, but obviously, feel better than we did 90 days ago. In the defense military revenue, growth in the low single-digit percent or slightly down year-to-date, but the strong year-to-date bookings and the strong Q2 bookings give us some confidence here.","Commercial OEM revenues, we see growth in the low to mid single-digit percent range. We're still assuming commercial transport shipments will be slightly up, but we're concerned that the biz jet shipments for the year could be flat to modestly down. We also expect to see a modest decrease in freighter revenue for the year, based on the announced 747 rate decrease.","Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.1 billion in cash and over $400 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016 \u2013 excuse me, $500 million, we also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activity, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9 times EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down about one full turn.","In summary, Q2 was a good quarter, as we look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are still a little unclear and that makes us cautious. However, we think we still may have some modest margin upside to help offset any market variations. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent, value-focused strategy and a strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our shareholders.","And with that, let me turn this over to Kevin.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good second quarter. As we've stated previously, we believe our planning processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year.","For an update on our acquisition-related value driver, let me give you an update on the last acquisitions we accomplished. To this point, let me once again provide some color to our acquisition strategy. As we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes an implementation of our value creation process and metrics, restructuring the company into our business unit focus groups, focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business and finally, we tighten up the cost structure.","For Telair, this was a significant acquisition in early 2015 for TransDigm and focuses on the defense and commercial cargo markets. Today, the acquisition is on track, on its integration path and has delivered sales and EBITDA in excess of our model. In general, the defense market has performed well for us in this business, but the freight market may be beginning to soften. We remain confident that this is a fine business for TransDigm.","Additionally, we closed on Pexco in May of 2015, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used in the galleys, lavatories, floors, ceilings, and stowage bins of aircraft. Today Pexco Aerospace is performing at our expectations across all key financial and growth metrics, with a strong focus on our value generation strategy.","The team successfully closed and completed the consolidation of the manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach with minimal customer disruption. While implementing a largely new management team at Pexco, we have realized better than expected productivity results with all of our manufacturing activities now under one roof. With performance on our value drivers ahead of plan, we currently are finding sales and EBITDA are additionally running ahead of plan. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will continue to run at expectations.","In August of 2015, we finalized the acquisition PneuDraulics into the TransDigm family. PneuDraulics is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. PneuDraulics' highly engineered and proprietary products primarily are valves, actuators and subsystem components used in hydraulic and pneumatic applications. PneuDraulics serves all of the major markets in aerospace, including commercial, regional, business jet and defense markets.","We were confident when we acquired PneuDraulics that it was a solid business with an excellent management team. This has proven to be the case, as the management team has proven to be fast adopters of the TransDigm value drivers culture. The integration of PneuDraulics is going according to the plan. The company's performance has met or beat expectations for the three value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing.","Although we have experienced some softness in the business jet market, the commercial aerospace market is currently holding up well and our EBITDA, driven by our value driver concept, has exceeded our expectations. In general, we are pleased with the results and expect this business to be a solid acquisition and a good company for TransDigm in the future.","Lastly, Breeze-Eastern was acquired by TransDigm on January 4, 2016. Breeze, which is located in Whippany, New Jersey, designs and manufactures mission critical electromechanical systems. The main products consist of rescue hoists, cargo hooks and winches, primarily for rescue helicopters and cargo aircraft. Approximately 75% of Breeze revenue comes from the defense sector and approximately 70% of it comes from the aftermarket.","In the first 90 days since the acquisition, we have established a new leadership team, comprised of both existing Breeze-Eastern employees as well as experienced TransDigm personnel. We have also taken productivity actions to better align the size of the organization with the level of business activity, which will increase overall value, including the announcement of the consolidation of the Virginia facility into the main campus by late calendar year 2016.","We are also realigning the business into our usual customer-focused business unit teams to enhance operational performance and responsiveness. These changes will be completed during the second half of our fiscal year as we align the financial reports with these two business units and we physically colocate the team personnel within the facility. These changes will support and accelerate new product development activities as the teams are beginning to focus on rapidly bringing advanced hoist and winch technologies to market. To date, the Breeze-Eastern acquisition has delivered value as expected for TransDigm shareholders, with revenue and EBITDA as expected.","To update on the recent progress of our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to three recent wins we have received in the aerospace market. AvtechTyee recently was awarded significant bookings across multiple configurations of a recently upgraded sealed audio control panel used on the Boeing 737 Next Generation. The bulk of these orders were primarily to satisfy initial provisioning of spares by airlines with upcoming deliveries from Boeing. The bookings also included upgraded sealed audio control panels with satellite communication functionality. This functionality enables the flight crew to directly dial and connect to any phone number around the world through existing satellite communication networks in areas where HF and VHF radio function can be unreliable.","Next at PneuDraulics, we were awarded components in four major hydraulic system areas by Textron Aviation for the Cessna Longitude program. PneuDraulics was awarded hydraulic components for spoiler actuation, brake systems, landing gear and central hydraulic systems. Additionally, this represents the largest total shipset award for PneuDraulics to date. 24 discrete components were awarded per aircraft, with a forecasted build rate of 36 aircraft per year at peak and a production launch in the next couple of years.","Lastly, Aero Fluid Products has won an exciting new program for the A320neo. The Painesville, Ohio-based team was awarded the oil control manifold for this new program. The OCM is an aluminum block mounted on the main engine gearbox that contains multiple valves, openings and sensors that control the temperatures and pressures of the engine oil. This is a growth award as the team did not enjoy this business on the A320 legacy platform.","Finally, I wanted to bring your attention to one of our key business planning processes. Last time, I updated all of you on our succession planning process. Given the time in the fiscal year, I now wanted to update on our fiscal year 2017 planning process, which we have just kicked off. This process gives us an excellent glimpse of the aerospace market for commercial and defense applications.","This process is a bottoms-up forecast done by each of our individual product lines, rolling up to business units then the entire company, with a focused emphasis on our TransDigm value drivers of productivity, value-based pricing and new business. This process, which is the foundation of our fiscal year guidance that we provide to the market each year, begins with a lot of hard work by each individual business unit and culminates with focused reviews of each of our 31-plus operating companies and about 80 business unit teams throughout the back end of our fourth quarter.","We believe this granular bottoms-up data-based review is the best way we know of to compile market intelligence and provide guidance to our shareholders. It has served us well and allowed us to generally be quite accurate in our annual guidance and internal planning.","With that, now let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail. Terry?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I will now review our (25:28). Second quarter net sales were $797 million or approximately 29% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions, Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics, Breeze and Franke, was an increase of $150 million. Organic sales were up approximately 4.5%, driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. Our first quarter gross profit was $426 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year.","Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was almost 2 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of over 3 margin points.","Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved about 1.5 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure, as well as favorable mix from strong commercial aftermarket sales. Additionally, gross profit margins improved over 0.5 point sequentially, excluding all acquisition activity.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.9% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12% in the prior year. Excluding the acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $11 million versus the prior year quarter. This was the result of an increase to our outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was to fund acquisitions we did in fiscal 2015.","Our effective tax rate was 31% in the current quarter compared to 29.2% in the prior year. The higher effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to a favorable discrete adjustment in the prior year, related to finalizing IRS audits related to fiscal 2012 and 2013.","Our expected full year estimated tax rate is still expected to be 31%. We now expect our cash taxes to be around $210 million for fiscal 2016. Our net income for the quarter increased $28 million, or 25%, to $139 million, which is 17.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $111 million or 17.9% net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher interest expense and acquisition-related costs versus the prior period.","GAAP EPS was $2.47 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.96 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.86 per share, an increase of 35.5% compared to $2.11 per share last year. Please refer to table three in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Now, switching gears to cash and liquidity, we ended the quarter with $612 million of cash. I want to remind you that during the quarter, we paid $146 million for the Breeze acquisition, net of $31 million of cash acquired. We also spent $137 million to purchase approximately 692,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, in total this year, we have purchased just over 1 million shares at a total cost of $208 million. We now expect our full year weighted-average shares to be 56.2 million.","The company's net leverage ratio at the quarter end was 5.6 times our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and the gross leverage was 6 times pro forma EBITDA As Defined. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016 will be 4.9 times, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions.","With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.01. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.16. The $1.15 of adjustments to bridge GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend equivalent payments, $0.57 from non-cash stock option expense and $0.53 of acquisition-related expenses.","Now, I'll hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Terry. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey, Carter.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quick clarification, Nick, on the OEM revision, should we just assume that it's just a inventory destock associated with the rate cuts on 777, 747 the publicly announced ones and maybe some of the business jets, is that really what you're really seeing there, it's the sort of transitory effect of inventory?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. There's a little bit inventory movement, and I would say we're a little \u2013 and the other is the freighter rate cut but everyone knows about that, but the \u2013 and we're probably \u2013 we're less bullish \u2013 maybe more bearish is the better way to put it on the business biz jet market.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So when you say you're less \u2013 or bearish, does that mean you're looking to the end of the year and keeping some cushion for potential summer lower production activity?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, you're talking about the biz jet now, Carter?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, on biz jet. Yeah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think what you're probably seeing \u2013 what you're seeing is the numbers have been less exciting than we hoped. We had sort of anticipated the year that was flat to slightly up in business jet. As we see our numbers part-way through the year in our bookings, that's starting to look a little less likely to us. Could there be a little upside to that? Possibly there could.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll let somebody else ask.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Your line is open.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, Nick. (32:43) the commercial aftermarket.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey, Ken, I can barely hear you. You're breaking up.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, sorry about that. Is that any better?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Sorry. So, I just wanted to follow up on the commercial aftermarket, great numbers in the quarter. Was there anything \u2013 I know obviously you were flat last quarter, do you get a sense that there was anything that may be pushed from the first quarter to the second quarter or anything unusual or one-time in nature in the up 13%, or really just sort of a culmination of what we started to hear about in terms of increased spending by the airlines on some of the older aircraft?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think you're starting to see \u2013 you have a situation where it ran low too long. I don't think you can count on 13% growth quarter-over-quarter in perpetuity by any means. I'd probably look at it more like the first half of the year, it's up 7% to 8%, maybe it was a little too light in the first quarter and a little heated in the second quarter. But I think the best way to look at it sort of on a year-to-date basis.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Now, that's reasonable. And obviously, you've maintained the full year guidance...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","...even though your comparisons now start to anniversary with certainly the weaker back half of fiscal 2015. Is that really, like you talked about, just reflecting, obviously this recovery could be lumpy and visibility is probably a little more challenged now, or is there anything else that is maybe holding you back a little bit on this \u2013 on the outlook?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. I think we had a judgment in the beginning of the year and we're about the same place still.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Well, thank you very much and nice quarter.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Your line is open.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. This is Bill Ledley on for Gautam as he's traveling to Boeing. I have a question for you on if any of your proprietary products have been sole source -the sole source products, have they been awarded to any competitors or second source from the OEMs?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I presume you mean recently, not in the history of our whole life?","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Recently.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not that we know of. Not that we know of. And I don't mean to be evasive there, but I think we'd know of them but we don't know of any.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.

I don't know that I can say it's one more than another and as you know, we don't \u2013 as we've said, it's very difficult to predict closings. It was last quarter, I said it didn't look very good, and this quarter things are getting active again. For some reason, we see more.

We're feeling bad about everybody heading out to the Boeing.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","(36:01)","Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC","Quick one on your guidance, it looks like you're expecting margins about the same in the back half as the first half, is there any reason why that shouldn't sort of grow a little bit just on higher volumes?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think on the back half (36:19)","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I thought we moved the margins up (36:20).","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It will be up probably in the second half than they were year-to-date.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'm sort of disconnecting on that. I thought the second half was up a little, not a lot, but a little.","Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","(36:28) high second quarter aftermarket mix.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Let me just look into the numbers.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Right there.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. It's not up a lot, but it's up maybe 0.5 point in the second half.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","If you back into it.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And as I said, we could have a little room there.","Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. And then I guess one other one going back to your acquisition pipeline, it sounds like things are accelerating a little bit there. I guess, as you get bigger, is it getting more difficult to find deals that are big enough to move the needle there or is that not an issue?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we think there's still plenty of stuff. I mean, obviously, just mathematically, the bigger you get, the average size acquisition doesn't move the needle as much, you got to buy more of them to move the needle as much. But I think at least so far, we still see adequate number of businesses, the question is getting them to sell or not, not are there enough. And then \u2013 and we feel better about the, as I've said, the rate of activity right now.","Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. It's actually Myles on for Myles.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Is this Myles?","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It is, Myles on for Myles.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It is Myles? Myles for Myles.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Myles on for Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm already in Seattle.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I came in early just to be in your call, Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","This actually is Harry speaking for Nick.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, the first one is on the EBITDA margin increase. So I think, Kevin, you said it was from the acquisitions, or maybe it was Nick who said it was from the acquisitions and the core was still running at 49%. That's a pretty high increase for the acquired margins in terms of versus what you were otherwise planning. I think if you back into it, it's maybe a 500 basis point plus increase to your underlying acquired margins in the kind of planning period. So was that cost, is it price, is it volume, can you just elaborate a little bit?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. The answer is in total, I don't know the answer. I know it business by business but I don't know the answer in total. But they are \u2013 I'm going to give you a guesstimate here to some degree.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think \u2013 the volumes are not \u2013 in net-net, the volumes are not way up, which means it's primarily the other pieces of margin, which is cost and price.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Price and cost.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I know in total, their revenues aren't way up.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, okay. And the only clarification on the 13%, so when you give the organic, which would exclude the acquisitions for both periods, would the aftermarket growth be materially different than that 13% we saw reported on a pro forma basis?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's not materially different. It's not materially different.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And the last one, Nick, so you talked about the normalization in the debt markets","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is there any inclination to tap when the well is running healthy and maybe take advantage of open markets and healthy markets, if they're giving you the same rates you currently have, and just be more proactive than not?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","As you know, we're always looking at that. We're always looking at that in conjunction with the acquisition pipeline. And that's one we'll sort of decide as things clarify for us.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But you don't feel like the trends are kind of a cloud break before more clouds return, you think it's kind of just become more of what it was and it was anomalous earlier in the year.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Myles, I think it's, as I've said before, I kind of feel like it's a loser's game to speculate on the capital markets.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","To some degree we have our sort of view of what we like and what we don't like, and...","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...we kind of make a decision when the time comes. As I've said for the last five years, we've consistently lost money on interest rate hedges. That hasn't changed our view, we'll just keep pouring the money down a rat hole.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. You make more than enough money in other places, Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Right.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks. Good quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Can you hear me all right?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Here in Seattle as well, they do have phones here. So given that, I just want to go back to where Myles was going. The 13% aftermarket in fiscal second quarter versus this flat performance in fiscal first quarter. I want to make sure I understood, were you alluding to that being more pricing-driven rather than volume, or is it equal?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. All I meant to say is that I'd probably look at it as a year-to-date number, rather than get too hung up on what the first quarter and second quarter were. If I implied it was mostly price \u2013 if I implied it was 13% was price was the big driver, I didn't mean to say that. If I did, that was a mistake.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No. No. Okay. I just wanted to make sure \u2013 I want to get a sense from a destocking or activity perspective, what's really creating this volatility and then how we can get comfortable \u2013 if we can get comfortable \u2013 with what the second half looks like. And which begs a follow-on question, which is what is the embedded organic growth in the full year guidance? So we've had minus \u2013 let's say, we've had 1.7% for six months organic growth, what is in the guidance?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we gave you the guidance, it's mid to high single-digits.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I'm talking about...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's the guidance for the year, which happens to be about where we are halfway through the year.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hold on, I'm talking about your organic growth, 4.4% in the quarter, minus 1.1% in the first quarter. So, 1.7% positive for the first half of the year, okay, organic growth.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Oh, total company, I thought you were talking about commercial.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, no, no. I'm sorry. I switched gears there.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I lost you, I thought you were talking about the commercial aftermarket.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So I know that you've divided it by segment in the slides, so I'm talking about the overall company (43:23)","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Got you, got you, got you. I want to \u2013 I'm not looking at the number here, but I want to say it's about 4%. It's about 4% is the organic growth year-over-year in our guidance.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So the second half should be marginally better than the first half.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. Yes.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And then from an employment perspective, you obviously raised your margins, you've streamlined \u2013 Kevin talked about this but, again, I know you're looking at the volumes from a six-month perspective. If you're going to have a little bit better growth here in the backend of the year, how do you \u2013 do you have the capacity as is, do you have to add some people?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We have capacity. Whether we'd have to add a few here and there, I don't know the exact number Rob, but there's no problem with capacity.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Well, that's it for me. Thanks, Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It'd be within a reasonable range, within the reasonable range of variation. You could see in six months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning and good quarter. In the aftermarket, there's been a disconnect recently in the level of organic growth for the power and control pieces versus the airframe. Wonder if you could talk about what that was in the quarter and maybe a little bit about why do you think that disconnect emerged?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think there's any particular reason for that. It's primarily just a mix of the businesses. I would say that one probably has a little more defense business in it than the other and that may have it down a little lower. There's no systematic difference between them.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And you'll see the numbers in the 10-Q when we file that tomorrow.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Any difference in the results are primarily just the difference between what the aftermarket content is from one versus the other, what the defense versus commercial content is and one versus the other, it'll make them move around.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then I guess of the, let's say, 7% to 8% year-to-date pro forma aftermarket growth that we've seen, of the 30 or so business units that you referenced, about how many of those would you say were above average, how many were below average?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the exact number, but it was a good quarter, and it was not \u2013 everyone's not up, but generally \u2013 as a general rule, it was a good quarter for most businesses.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","How are you doing?","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Nick, can you talk \u2013 I mean there's certainly been a lot of structural change in the aftermarket, I mean you've got the battle tested business model with -pricing may be coming under pressure, more OEMs getting involved, pooling, used parts, do you guys have to do anything differently or can the model continue to sustain without any change?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We think the model is fine. We'll keep watching, I don't quite know that we're as bought in to these structural changes, but \u2013 how much of it's just the normal cycle, but we keep watching them. We don't see any reason that our fundamental model doesn't continue to work, at least in the foreseeable future. I can't tell what 20 years from now does, but in the foreseeable future, I don't see anything that structurally changes the fundamentals here.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Is there \u2013 can you walk me \u2013 I mean we keep hearing some suppliers talk about going after product lines that are maybe at a premium. And maybe just educate me on this, there is sole source proprietary product, can it actually be recompeted, can it be certified? It seems like there's some mix messaging out there. I mean do you guys still feel like those product lines that are our sole source proprietary that you own the IP, are those still bulletproof or can they be recertified, redesigned or dual sourced?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, anything \u2013 I mean, ultimately, as I like to say, if TransDigm went bankrupt and died and all the plants caught on fire, ultimately, the airline industry would find a way to survive. So, it's not that there's no other way to get around it. It is a \u2013 there's a significant entry barrier, there's significant cost, there's significant qualification. There's also the issue that we own the IP, so you've got to find a way around that. It's a substantive barrier that we frankly have not seen any material change in. Now, is it impossible? If you don't care about the costs, you can always find a way around most anything.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I don't see any fundamental change in the switching cost characteristics here.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Just the last one for me, defense. Looks like it got a little worse sequentially, still guiding for the up low single-digit for the year. How good do you feel about that, how good is your visibility? I know you talked about the bookings running ahead of (48:38)","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's not good through the whole year, but it's good \u2013 it's getting good through more of the year, obviously, each month. And we have \u2013 the bookings have been strong.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, we feel reasonably good about our guidance. So, I would say we feel quite good about our guidance in total. I don't \u2013 we could be off a point here and there on a segment and we think we've given you our best judgment.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Fair. I'll jump back in the queue. Nice quarter, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, thank you. Sorry for the cell phone, can you hear me, okay?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Great, thanks. So a little more on commercial aftermarket. So when everything was melting down earlier in the year and with the benefit of hindsight, Nick, can you \u2013 are your customers maybe a little more fragile than you thought they were? And if so, which areas of the business might be a little bit more soft or discretionary that maybe you didn't anticipate? And conversely, which areas might be a little bit less discretionary and maybe hung in a little bit better relevant to some of the other parts, as things were really, really hairy there earlier in the year?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, first let me pack up the word fragile. The vast majority of our aftermarket is sole source proprietary stuff. So it's not that it's going somewhere else, it's that the customer either has decided to defer something or draw down their inventory, so I mean ultimately over time. And that's a very customer by customer situation.","So, it's hard to make any generic comment on that. As far as our outlook for the year, I guess the way I would answer that is we started off the year saying that our outlook was for mid to high single-digits growth and we're still the same place. So I would say if I look at this half way through the year, we're about where we thought we'd be.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Okay. Maybe let me ask the question in a different way as a follow up. Again, when things were really, really dicey there a few months ago, I know you guys were worried you thought you were going to be all-in, but does it change the way you maybe think about certain segments of the aftermarket in terms of how you'd pursue M&A? Or do you look at just those prior couple months there sort of a one-off anomaly, and not so much sort of like a thesis-altering type of approach in how you think about pursuing acquisitions going forward?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Certainly doesn't change the way we pursue acquisitions. We're looking for proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. And I would say we don't find a quarter or a couple of quarters' \u2013 that would be nothing that would change our fundamental strategy nor has it.","Hunter K.

My name is Crystal and I will be the operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2015 second quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Stein; our Senior Executive Vice President, Greg Rufus; and Terry Paradie, our new Chief Financial Officer.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks. Replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC. These are available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, now let me turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning and thanks again to everyone for calling in to hear about our company.","Today, I'll review as usual our consistent business strategy. I'll do an update on our recent acquisitions, I'll go through the financial performance and the market summary for both this quarter and year-to-date, I'll review our guidance for 2015, and also introduce Terry Paradie, our new CFO.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and in its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary engineered product and around three-quarters of our net sales from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability in the downturns. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital requirements, TransDigm has year-in and year-out generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structure flexibility.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven value-based operating strategy based around our three value driver concepts, that is, steady cost reduction, profitable new business generation and value-based pricing.","Three, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system with executives and senior managers who think, act and are paid like owners.","Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to PE, or private equity, like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as another means to create significant shareholder value.","To remind you, we basically have four alternatives for capital allocations, and our priorities are typically as follows: First, invest in our existing businesses. Second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. These first two are almost always our preferred choices. Three, give extra back to the shareholders either through special dividends or stock buyback. And lastly, pay off debt. Given the low cost of debt, especially on an aftertax basis, this is likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions.","With respect to financial capacity, we have about $390 million in cash, roughly $325 million in unrestricted undrawn revolver and additional capacity under our credit agreement. We ended the quarter with a net leverage of 6.1 times EBITDA, well below our credit agreement limit.","At 3\/28\/2015, or in other words, at the end of the quarter, based on current capital market conditions and after all recently announced finance activities and M&A activities, including Pexco, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of additional acquisitions without issuing any more equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. Once again, this does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for fiscal year 2015.","As you likely saw, we recently closed on two transactions: the Telair cargo handling business for about $725 million, subject to certain adjustments, we closed this one right before the end of Q2, and the Franke aerospace faucet business for $75 million right after the end of Q2.","Starting with the smaller of the two, on March 31, we closed Franke. This business fits well with our Adams Rite faucet business. It has substantial positions on most of the Airbus commercial transport platforms, while Adams Rite has similar positions at Boeing.","The business is located near Berlin, Germany. We intend to relocate it to our Adams Rite business in Fullerton, California, over the next 12 months or so. This business is almost all proprietary, sole source and commercial aerospace with over 60% aftermarket. All in all, a good fit.","On March 26, we closed on the purchase of the Telair Group of businesses for a purchase price of about $725 million. We financed this acquisition primarily through cash on hand. The Telair Cargo Group annual revenues are expected to be about $300 million with EBITDA margins approaching 20%. For the fiscal year ended 2015 (08:03) year-end 2015.","Telair is a global leader in commercial transport OEM, onboard cargo loading and handling systems. Over 80% of the revenues are from commercial aerospace market with the balance from the military aero. Approximately 45% of the revenues come from the aftermarket, primarily commercial transport and commercial cargo aircraft. Over 90% of the revenues are from proprietary products with about 80% sold on a sole source basis.","The business consists of three operating units: Telair Europe in Germany, Nordisk Aviation Products in Norway, and Telair U.S. Cargo Systems in North Carolina. The business employs just over 600 people in its various locations.","The Telair Europe business in Miesbach, Germany, is the largest operating unit, accounting for roughly 60% of the revenues and a higher percent of the profit. It has long-standing relationships with Airbus and Boeing, resulting in a substantial installed base of systems worldwide, as well as positions on a broad range of new aircraft. They are the primary supplier of onboard cargo handling systems to Airbus commercial transports as well as Canadair and Embraer.","Nordisk, located in Norway, is a market leader in air transport cargo containers and related items. Nordisk's products are in service with nearly every airline or freight company in the world. Nordisk will report to our AmSafe Cargo Containment Net business in UK.","Telair U.S. is headquartered in Goldsboro, North Carolina, is also a supplier of onboard cargo handling systems and components for a variety of commercial and military platforms, including passenger to freighter conversions. Their largest platform is the A400M, the Boeing 767 freighters, aftermarket spares also and a bit of modification work make up much of the remainder of the business. At this time, we do not expect this business in total, that being the Telair business, can get up to the average TransDigm EBITDA margins. This is due to a number of factors including the more competitive Container business and certain contractual commitments on some of the businesses.","As I mentioned in the press release, we currently anticipate that the run rate for revenue will be relatively flat for the first 12 months to 18 months of our ownership of Telair. This is due to a significant A400 shipments in fiscal year 2015 that may not fully repeat in our fiscal year 2016. This should be offset by market growth in other areas in fiscal 2016, the ramp up in A350 shipments, on which we have significant content, should begin to contribute meaningfully beyond that. As with all our acquisitions, we expect to generate private equity-like returns on these.","Additionally, we recently announced the execution of an agreement to acquire Pexco from Odyssey Investment Partners for $496 million. This includes approximately $160 million of tax benefits spread over 15 years. We don't own this business yet, so we're very limited in what we can say, but we believe this will be a strong addition to our portfolio of companies. The company's revenues are almost 100% commercial transport aerospace. They are a major supplier of Boeing commercial transport airplanes for interior plastic extruded parts. The aftermarket is about 35% of the revenue today, but over the next five years it should expand to about 60%, as the high content 737 with Sky Interiors and the Boeing 787 continue to grow as a percent of the fleet.","You may have seen, we also just announced a new financing of about $900 million. This is currently intended to be used to both pay for the Pexco acquisition and also general corporate purposes. Given the very strong credit market, we believe it makes sense to finance the deal this way, while maintaining substantial dry powder for future opportunities. As always, if we end up with more cash or capacity than we need, we'll consider other uses or capital allocations.","I'd also like to introduce Terry Paradie, our new CFO. Terry is a great addition to our team. I'm sure most of you saw his background in our press release, so I won't repeat most of it. But Terry came to us from Cliffs National Resources most recently as CFO. And prior to Cliffs, he was a partner at KPMG. Greg Rufus will be around for another 15 months to 18 months to assist in the transition and other projects. Greg will do this earnings call and Terry will pick up the next. So if you have something negative or positive to tell Greg or to get out of your system, now is the time to do it.","Turning to our second quarter of fiscal 2015 performance, I remind you, this is the second quarter. Our fiscal year started October 1. As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by differences in OEM aftermarket mix, large orders, transient inventory fluctuations, modest seasonality and other factors.","But the company's total GAAP revenues were up 5% versus the prior Q2 and up 8% on a year-to-date basis versus the prior year. Organic revenues were up about 3% on both a quarter-versus-quarter basis, as well as on a year-to-date versus year-to-date basis. Year-to-date bookings are running ahead of revenues in all major market segments.","Reviewing revenues by market category and \u2013 as usual, that's on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q2 and prior year-to-date, pro forma meaning, we own the same mix of businesses in both areas. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 1% versus the prior Q2 and 3% on a year-to-date versus prior year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, this is driven primarily by commercial transport shipments being up around 5%. Our business jet OEM revenues were down in Q2. We believe this is just a timing issue.","Business just bookings are running nicely ahead of shipments. Though much less revenue, the commercial helicopters, both shipments and bookings, are down substantially in the quarter. In the commercial aftermarket revenues, in total, the commercial transport segment was up about 9.5% on a Q2 versus prior year Q2 basis. But this was offset by a \u2013 or partially offset by a modest decline in the Business Jet\/General Aviation business and again, though small in revenue, a very substantial decline in the commercial helicopter segment.","Overall, our commercial aftermarket was up about 7% on a Q2 versus prior year Q2 basis and about 6% on a year-to-date basis. Bookings for the quarter and year-to-date are running ahead of revenues. Given the difficult comps in the back half of the year, soft business jet and a declining commercial helicopter revenues, unless we get a fourth quarter spike like we did last year, it'll be tough to get the high single digit growth for this year for the entire commercial aftermarket.","Moving on to defense, which makes up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues were up 2% versus the prior year second quarter and about the same 2% on a year-to-date basis. The results continue to be mixed across businesses. Bookings, however, ran well ahead of revenues on both a quarter and year-to-date basis. We should see some full year revenue upside here.","Moving to profitability now, and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The as-defined adjustments in Q2 were made up of non-cash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs. Our EBITDA As Defined is about $288 million for Q2. This was up 10% versus the prior Q2, significantly more than the revenue. Year-to-date is $558 million and also up about 10% versus the prior year.","The EBITDA As Defined margin was about 46.5% of revenue in the quarter and year-to-date. That was up 2% from the prior year Q2 and 1% from the prior year-to-date. The Q2 and year-to-date EBITDA margins without dilution from the impact of the two acquisitions we purchased in 2014, that is Airbus and EME \u2013 or Airborne and EME, we didn't buy Airbus, was approximately 48%. We expect this core group of businesses to be at about 49% for the full year.","With respect to acquisitions, we've been busy, as I discussed. We continue looking at opportunities. We still see a reasonable amount of activity, but closings are always difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Moving on now to the 2015 guidance. Based on our current view of the business, excluding the Telair and Franke acquisitions, our full-year guidance for revenue and EBITDA As Defined remains generally unchanged. As I mentioned before, due to the tougher comps and other factors, we are concerned that the commercial aftermarket may fall a bit short of high single-digit growth. However, at this time, we think there is adequate upside in defense revenue and our overall EBITDA margins to offset any potential EBITDA impact.","We are, however, adjusting our total company guidance upwards to reflect both our new acquisitions and a more favorable tax rate. As usual, our guidance does not include any additional acquisitions other than Telair and Franke, the ones we have closed. It does not include Pexco, since we have not closed that yet.","Our revised guidance for the total company is as follows: revenue \u2013 and this is to the midpoint \u2013 is $2.68 billion, up about $140 million versus the prior midpoint; EBITDA as adjusted guidance is now $1.21 billion to the midpoint, up about $32 million versus the prior; EPS as adjusted guidance is $8.62 a share to the midpoint \u2013 that's up $0.46 to the midpoint from the previous guidance. Of the increase in adjusted EPS of $0.46 at the midpoint, the majority of the increase is from the recent acquisitions with much of the balance due to a more favorable tax rate.","By market segment, excluding the most recent acquisitions, we are using the following assumptions. Commercial OEM, mid-single-digit growth. This is unchanged. Commercial aftermarket, mid-single-digit growth. This is modestly down from our prior guidance. Defense, low to mid-single-digit growth. This is modestly up from our prior guidance. As usual, we'll look at this again next quarter and update you if we see things changing.","All in all, a good quarter. Our operating results were strong, we closed on two solid acquisitions and we expect Pexco to close soon. When Pexco closes, we will have invested about $1.3 billion in good solid aero businesses with strong value generation prospects over a 90-day period.","And with that, let me hand this over to Greg.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks Nick. I'd like to correct one of Nick's earlier statements about our CFO transition. I'll only listen to the positive comments; the negative comments can go directly to Terry. I'm very pleased with the addition of Terry to our team and I can assure you we'll have a seamless transition.","As disclosed in this morning's press release, our second quarter sales were $619 million and approximately 5% greater than the prior year. Our organic sales were approximately 3.5% higher than last year, primarily driven by growth in the commercial aftermarket, offset by lower growth rates in commercial OEM and defense.","Our second quarter gross profit was $342 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year. The reported gross profit margin of 55.2% was three margin points higher than the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments, our gross profit margin in the business versus the prior-year quarter improved approximately two margin points. The operations continue to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure. Also, there was a decrease in non-operating acquisition-related cost versus the prior year and this contributed an additional one margin higher to the reported margin.","Selling and administration expenses were 12% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12.1% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock compensation expense, the SG&A expense was about 10.3% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales a year ago. Interest expense was $100 million, an increase of approximately $18 million or 21% versus the prior-year quarter. This is a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $7.5 billion in the current quarter versus $5.7 billion in the prior year.","The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the amount borrowed to fund the $25 per share special dividend paid in the third quarter of last year. Also in conjunction with that dividend, we refinanced $1.6 billion of existing notes to a lower interest rate. This refinancing helped lower our weighted average cash interest rate to 5.1% compared to 5.4% in the prior year.","Our lower effective tax rate in the quarter was primarily due to the impact of our foreign earnings being taxed at a lower rate, resulting from the new structure formed in conjunction with the Telair and Franke acquisitions, as well as favorable discrete adjustments relating to finalizing our IRS audits for both fiscal years 2012 and 2013. We estimate that our current tax structure will help lower our effective rate. For fiscal year 2015, our effective tax rate will be below 32%. We now expect our cash taxes to be approximately $175 million for fiscal 2015.","Our net income for the quarter increased $20.5 million or 23% to $110.9 million, which is 18% of sales. This compares to net income of $90.4 million or 15% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, improvement in base margins, the decrease in acquisition-related costs and amortization expense and a lower effective tax rate. These items were partially offset by the higher interest expense just discussed.","Our GAAP earnings per share was $1.96 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.49 per share last year. The current EPS growth of 32% is higher than net income growth due to the dividend equivalent payment made in the comparable quarter last year that did not repeat. Our adjusted earnings per share was $2.11 per share, an increase of 13% compared to $1.87 per share last year. Again, please reference table three in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP to adjusted EPS.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity, first, I want to remind you that during the quarter, we paid $725 million for Telair and borrowed $75 million on our existing revolving credit facility as part of that transaction. After these activities, we ended the quarter with approximately $393 million of cash on the balance sheet.","A few days after our quarter ended, we closed on the Franke acquisition and paid $75 million in cash. Adjusting our cash balance for the acquisition of Franke, our adjusted cash balance would be approximately $318 million. The company's net debt leverage ratio was 6.1 times our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, including both Telair and Franke, and gross leverage was 6.4 times on a pro forma EBITDA.","As Nick mentioned, this morning, we announced our plan to finance $900 million worth of proceeds to be used to pay for the acquisition of Pexco for approximately $496 million and almost $400 million added to the balance sheet to be used for general corporate purposes. Assuming the completion of these transactions, and absent any further acquisitions or capital market transactions, we expect to end the year with over $900 million of cash on the balance sheet and our net leverage to be near 5.8 times pro forma EBITDA As Defined.","With regards to our guidance, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $7.69. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the endpoint of our \u2013 or the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $8.62. The $0.93 of adjustments to bridge GAAP to adjusted earnings per share includes the following assumptions: $0.06 from the dividend equivalent payments, $0.41 from non-cash stock option expense and $0.46 from acquisition-related expenses. The large increase is due to the recent acquisitions of Telair and Franke.","Just of note, both acquisitions just closed will require transition service agreements which will include certain accounting activities we will require from the sellers for a period after ownership. Because of this, we will be on a one-month reporting lag for both Telair and Franke. Our current plan is to have two months of activity in our third quarter results and catch up and have the four months of activity in our fourth quarter.","Now, I'll it hand it back over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, guys. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, I'd ask that you'd limit your questions to two per caller. If you have further questions, please re-insert yourself into the queue and we'll answer those as time permits. Operator, we are now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Nick, and welcome, Terry and Greg. Thanks for helping us all this time and congrats on not having to put up with us anymore.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not quite. He's got to hang around 15 months.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. I know. He just doesn't have to listen to us on this every quarter.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Still got to listen to Nick.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Couple of questions. One from a high level, Nick. When you look at the three recent transactions and compare them to some of the others you've seen, whether it's Airborne, EME, I wonder if you might compare and contrast those and how you feel about these. They certainly look like some of the transactions we've seen in the past, obviously, Franke and Adams Rite or Pexco and Schneller. I wonder if you might just give us some color about how you think about how you think about these acquisitions versus some of the others you've done in the past couple years.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, if I compare that to say Airborne, these are more right down the middle of the plate kind of acquisitions, proprietary, aerospace, commercial aerospace, kind of things. I would describe them as I think that's the best way to do it, right down the middle of the plate. I would say \u2013 which by the way is what Arkwin was like and what the GE business was like, which were the previous ones we bought. As I mentioned to you, I think there's the \u2013 let me stay off Pexco. I think that's just because we don't own it yet and we're restricted in what we can say.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's fair.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I think it's a significant value generator. The Telair one, I think there's good upside, though as I said, Carter, I don't know that it gets up to the average at least for the next three years or so. There's just some contractual issues there.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Are those basically agreed to long-term prices?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't want \u2013 I can't really talk \u2013 confidentiality agreements with your customers. But that'd be a pretty good guess. I don't know what else would do it.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, exactly. Just a quick follow-on. Last quarter, you talked about being some distributor destocking. I didn't know if you saw any more of that or if you were past that or...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think we saw any meaningful change there this quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the deals.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question will come from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning Noah.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Greg, congrats on the retirement and the run you had here.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks. I feel old.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Can you guys walk us through why cash from ops was negative in the quarter and how you see it playing out the rest of the year?","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Terry, you want to handle this one?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, Noah, I think the biggest driver for cash from ops being negative is kind of three areas. There was a big income tax payment made during the quarter of over $80 million, as well as you're also seeing interest payments of over $140 million during the quarter and then just plainly the working capital changes during the quarter, which drove the negative cash from operations for the quarter. But it's just timing. I think we're comfortable and confident that we'll generate the planned free cash flow for the full year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And can you remind us what that plan is?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, in my numbers, that by the end of the year, we'll now have $900 million in cash on the balance sheet.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Assuming we'll put $400 million from that financing....","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So $500 million without the financing, $400 million because we'll probably throw in there from the financing.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Can you tell us how much of the commercial OE and aftermarket revenues that you report are helicopter?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's a small \u2013 I don't know the exact percent. It's a small percent. It's surely in the single digits, well in the single digits. And the only reason that they register on the meter is because they drop off so much.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. And that's all oil and gas I assume?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think so. I think so. Nobody gives us a reason when they don't order, but that's surely what we surmise.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then in the full year commercial aftermarket growth target revision, is there any change to the large commercial aerospace piece of that?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know that I can call it exactly that close. I mean, clearly, the trends in the commercial transport look good. However, the comps get pretty tough. If you remember, the second half of last year was up 17%, 18%.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So the comps get tough. It's clearly going in the right direction. And absent anything else, it might well get there, but we're getting some down drags on the other pieces of it. And just when I'd put them all in a stew, it makes me feel like that high-single-digit number's a little risky. Now we get a spike like we did last year at the end of the year, we'll be fine, but that seems to me more of a sort of a hope than a plan.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to pick up on that cash flow question for just a second. So I think that the guidance had been $475 million. Cash taxes are now about $5 million lower and then you have another $32 million of EBITDA. So is free cash flow going to be closer to $500 million? Because if that's the case, it seems like your year-end cash balance should be closer to $1 billion than $900 million.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't reconcile all of the pieces, but I could tell you that our cash flow is what it is and our operating capital is pretty good. Our DSOs are in good shape, our inventory is in good shape. It's in the noise range, but we may spend like $10 million in transition service agreements, which wouldn't be part of the EBITDA, but that's only like $10 million with the two acquisitions. So I don't know to your starting point, or we have so many moving pieces with everything we just threw at you, but we think it's more like $900 million and everything's clicking in the right direction.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I just think we don't foresee any other acquisitions, we don't see any difference in our operations than we have...","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. No.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...on the cash generation.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","On the free cash flow side?","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, Greg, you also mentioned the tax structure improvements that you were making and it sounded like some of those may actually be more permanent and sticky. So is that 32% \u2013 I guess I couldn't quite discern what was discrete from prior years and what was more permanent in terms of tax structure going forward. So...","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, the discrete items were \u2013 we finished up an audit and did that. That was only $0.06, the discrete item.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And then as we go forward, we think the rate will be below 32%. Of this tax structure stuff, we won't give you an effective tax rate that we're going to forecast in 2016, but we think on an annualized basis, it's between $10 million and $12 million of tax savings from this restructuring \u2013 from this new structure we've set up with the former operations (37:36).","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Good deal. I'll take the two. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And congratulations on your retirement, Greg.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Nick, I thought we'd kick it off on the acquisition front. With Telair having a lower margin and Pexco having a higher percentage of OEM sales, does this indicate that you're not seeing as many of your classic targets out there as you maybe would have seen in the past?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know that I can say that. As I've always said, we're die everyday and the ones that look like they work, we take a swing at. I would say on aftermarket, Telair is a pretty hefty aftermarket. Franke's pretty hefty aftermarket. I think as we told you, the Pexco one is about 35% now, but just by natural occurrence, it's going to drift up to 60% just because the planes going in have much more content than the planes coming out. So I don't know that I would say that they're proprietary aerospace businesses with a fair amount of aftermarket. They don't \u2013 now, they see a clear path to that.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then second, you mentioned that bizjet aftermarket was a bit weak in the quarter. What's the driver of that? Is it lower flight activity or some destocking...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know enough \u2013 I really am not sure. I think it's a transient because the bookings look pretty good.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So we should expect that to accelerate maybe in the second half?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We give a guidance in total. We don't give it by each one of those segments. But with the bookings good, you would hope to see some pickup.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Okay. That's all from me. Thank you.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Welcome, Terry. Congrats, Greg.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rob.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Nick, on helicopter, since it's so weak, is there a way to frame where it is relative to its peak and its trough? I mean, how much more downside could there be both OE and\/or aftermarket?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't have the number in front of me, Rob. I don't think it's big enough to have a material impact on the business through the year, but it drops off enough it can sort of make some quarterly comparisons look funny. But I don't know the \u2013 as I sit here, I just don't know the exact numbers. It is far and away \u2013 it's way smaller than commercial transport as I'm sure you know and it is significantly smaller than business jet.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But it could continue to impact? In other words, we could see similar commentary next time?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then going over to Telair and the three years till the margins \u2013 well, I want to make sure I understand you correctly. Are you saying you can get there eventually, it's three years away or you're not going to get there?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. I'm saying right now, as I sit here today, we are not figuring we can get there. Now as contracts run out over time, our view on that may change, and hopefully \u2013 we tend to be somewhat conservative in our acquisition models, so hopefully we can do better. But we don't \u2013 we want to be sure we have a model that we can meet and get our PE-like returns without making too many wild assumptions. So, I'd figure it doesn't get there right now.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just the last thing, on the air transport aftermarket, or large aircraft aftermarket, and your comments earlier, understanding part of it's helicopter, part of it's bizjet. But just what the airlines are doing, do you think that just flight activity is so robust that we've maybe seen a slower sales demand or spares sales demand than we might see at some point? You mentioned a spike last year. Is there a bow wave that might be out there?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I mean, you know that's always a possibility. Right? Because if you take the, probably the last couple quarters, add them up and adjust for price, it probably isn't quite keeping up with RPMs. Now you also have the confounding variable of the six months before that, it was up 18% or something like that.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","(42:29).","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. So I don't exactly know how to parse that out. But, Rob, clearly there's some chance. But as I said, if we get a fourth quarter spike like we did last year, all will be well, but we're just not figuring on that. Now whether that comes or it doesn't come along, will have no effect or impact on that. It either will or it won't.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks very much, Nick.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Please proceed.","Ken G. Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning and congratulations, Greg, and welcome Terry again. Just wanted to first follow up on the defense market, if we could. Now, do you get a sense, Nick \u2013 I mean this is the second quarter in a row where you've talked about better bookings. Obviously, you raised the guidance a little bit. Have \u2013 you get a sense that we've hit an inflection point and this is sort of now what to expect moving forward? Or do you get a sense there's still some one-time issues perhaps that you're seeing in this market?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm very reticent to speculate on that since for the last three years or four years, I usually have been too pessimistic and it's done better. I will say, if you look through the data, it's still not clear. You got product lines all over the map: some up, some down, some sideways. I think I'd just have to stick with sort of the guidance we gave you. I feel pretty good looking six months out because our book \u2013 we've been shipping pretty well and our bookings are hanging in pretty well. I just \u2013 it's very difficult for me to speculate beyond that.","Ken G. Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think the chances \u2013 let me back \u2013 I think if you asked me four years ago, me and many people would have said, you could be looking at a 25% dislocation. I don't \u2013 I think the risk of that is likely behind us.","Ken G. Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. So it sounds like, at least moving forward here, with the bookings you've seen, there's a little more confidence perhaps in the outlook than certainly \u2013 I mean, I know you outperformed relative to your pessimistic expectations. But it sounds like there's just more confidence or visibility in the business.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Surely for the next six months.","Ken G. Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. That's great. And if I could, just on the commercial aftermarket, did you see \u2013 throughout the quarter, did you see any trends where maybe the year started a little softer and picked up through March that's maybe continued into April? Or was there any noticeable difference coming out of, calendar-wise, coming out of the fourth quarter December into January within commercial, specifically on the transport side with commercial aftermarket purchasing?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I don't think I can sort of slice the onion that thin. March always looks better to us because it's a five-week month for us in our accounting system.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Plus, we have all the holidays in the first quarter.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. In the first quarter, as you know, we're about eight to 10 days short on shipping days. So it always \u2013 the first quarter always looks a little worse. And the last quarter \u2013 the last month of each quarter looks good to us. Always looks good, because we're on a 4-4-5 schedule. So I don't know that I can parse that out and give you anything definitive.","Ken G. Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","I'd just like to ask if you can comment on the M&A pipeline now. After all these deals, do you still have a number of such opportunities?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, one thing I can say for sure is the pipeline today has three less businesses in it than it had 90 days ago. I think that's about the only thing I can say with certainty. We're still active. We're still looking at things. I have no ability to predict whether we are done buying or not done buying here for the year. Obviously, we think there is \u2013 we don't think we're dead or we wouldn't be looking to borrow more than we need to pay out, but time will tell.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And could you comment \u2013 the comment on defense bookings up significantly. Was this pretty broad based? Before it was mostly Airborne Systems, right?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I would say it is across businesses, though the Parachute business is the biggest pickup. That one's up very substantially. Others are up, but not to that degree. And it's still \u2013 I don't want to say it's a tide rising and all the ships are coming up still. I mean, it's still a mixed picture.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.

Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Congrats, Greg. Maybe, Greg, just for clarity, the $900 million in financing, I'm assuming that's not embedded in the outlook and I think maybe even perhaps more so I'm asking on maybe the right interest expense for the year. I don't think you gave an interest level for the year.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, that's not embedded in the forecast right now. I mean, as a general rule until we actually own it, we don't put it in. We were just giving you a little color on leverage.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So neither Pexco nor the additional debt. Neither one are in there.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Are in there. Right.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Just maybe on Pexco and Telair, is there any \u2013 you mentioned obviously the margins. Have both of those entities worked out their sort of Partnering for Success agreements with Boeing?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Pexco, yes. Telair is primarily an Airbus business.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And they don't have the same situation at Boeing.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's fair. And then just the last one maybe on Telair. Structurally, is it going to be harder to implement your value creation just given a lot of their European operations and labor laws there? And I guess maybe just an add-on to that, how much of a FX tailwind do you guys are going to pick up from Telair this year?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know what the tailwind is on FX, but it's a tailwind, not a headwind obviously.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know exactly...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Gregory Rufus - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're only putting on for half the year from when we bought it.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. And it's the change from when we bought it till the end of the year. A lot of the tailwind you saw already. So it isn't a big number. On the European productivity or cost situation, that's one that we understand we're in a different environment and I think we've \u2013 we hope we've reflected that appropriately. We're a little more conservative than we might be in a different situation.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. All right. That's all I had.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Liza, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next week and dial-in information can be found in this morning's press release or on our website at transdigm.com. It should also be noted that our Form 10-K will be filed this Friday.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks, everybody, for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with a few summary comments on our consistent strategy, then a little bit on 2018, 2019. I'll make a few comments on the Esterline deal that we recently announced. Kevin and Mike will review the business performance for 2018 and the outlook for 2019. I'd also like to point out that Mike Lisman here will be batting third today in his first big league start, so congratulate him.","To reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases in the cycle. To summarize why we believe that, about 90% of our net sales were generated by proprietary products and over three-quarters of our net sales comes from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues which typically have higher margins and provide relative stability through the cycles.","Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. Specifically, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Secondly, we utilize a simple, well-proven value-based operating methodology. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit our strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation is a key part of our value creation methodology.","Fiscal year 2018 was another good year for TransDigm. Revenues were up 9% and EBITDA up about 10% versus the prior year, and EBITDA margins again were solid. Fiscal year 2019 is shaping up as another good year. The growth in revenue and EBITDA As Defined are very similar to 2018. EPS will be negatively impacted by the non-repeating tax benefit and somewhat higher interest expense.","In fiscal year 2018, we spent about $660 million on three acquisitions, all three are good proprietary aerospace businesses that meet our strategic and return requirements. They are performing well and currently meet our or exceed our acquisition models.","Our liquidity is strong. We closed the year with about $2.1 million of cash and before closing Esterline or any other acquisitions or any other capital market activity in the next year, we'd expect to have about $3 billion in cash at fiscal year end 2019. We also have close to $600 million of undrawn revolver capacity and we have room under our credit agreement.","The timing of the Esterline closure and the related financing could significantly impact the actual cash at fiscal year end 2019. As I said, we have significant cash and availability. We continue to evaluate and seek M&A opportunities. We have a decent pipeline of mostly small and midsize possibilities. I can't predict or comment on possible closings, but I can say we're still working steadily at the M&A part of our business and we're open for business.","A few comments about our recent Esterline announcement. As I think you know, we are paying about $4 billion for roughly $2 billion in revenue and, based on public consensus information, approximately $330 million in fiscal year 2019 EBITDA. As we said before, we think Esterline has been a misunderstood company. Its core aerospace and defense business makes up about three-quarters or more of the revenue. This core business has proprietary content and sole source positions quite similar as a percent of revenue to TransDigm.","The core aftermarket also appears significant. We estimate over 30% of the revenue. The platform positions are good and they're fresh on the Boeing and Airbus platforms, on business and regional platforms, and many military programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter.","Closing could be 6 to 12 months after the signing timeframe. It could be sooner or it could be later, depending on the regulatory process which sometimes is hard to predict. It does appear now that we will not require a Chinese antitrust filing. But we have not made any decisions on asset disposition at this time. I would not be surprised if within a year or so after the acquisition closes, we will have sold some of the less aligned assets. We don't have any specifics or dollar amounts at this time.","This was a competitive process, as you will see from the Esterline proxy which will soon be filed. We decided that we wanted to own this and we paid the price to win it, though at roughly 12 times the consensus EBITDA for fiscal year 2019, it is well within the range of substantial aerospace acquisitions. We see a clear path to our PE-like return. As I said before, the EBITDA ramp-up may be a little slower. We are not modeling this to get to TDG levels of EBITDA margin. This is due to a number of factors, including our hopefully conservative forecasting since in the public process we don't get as much on-the-ground detail as we might like, some contractual situations, and the level of non-U.S. employment.","We do think the EPS as adjusted impact will be accretive in the first 12 months after acquisitions. Though the revenues have been flat in the last few years, assuming the market and economic conditions hold, we anticipate that a number of factors should contribute to a modestly more positive trend going forward. These include: the stabilization of the wide-body market and Esterline's strong positions on new wide-body platforms, the business jet and regional markets where they have good positions appear to be improving, certain significant defense program declines seem to have bottomed out, and when combined with good, solid content on the Joint Strike Fighter, the trend here looks encouraging. And lastly, the oil and gas markets seem to have bottomed out.","We have a good, experienced team already started on the integration planning and discussions with Esterline. This is headed by Bob Henderson, our Vice Chairman, a long-time senior executive with TransDigm. We have committed financing of $3.7 billion which is close to the full purchase price. Depending on the timing of the closing, exactly how much of this $3.7 billion financing commitment we will use versus the roughly $3 billion in cash we may have at that time, we still have to be determined and we'll decide as we get closer.","In any event, I do not expect that our net leverage at close will be out of line with our recent levels. Absent any other acquisitions or capital market activities, we should still delever about one turn a year thereafter.","Now let me hand this over to Kevin who will discuss both the 2018 performance as well as 2019 guidance.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. As you have seen, we had a strong fourth quarter to end another good year. Mike will provide more details on the financials, but our fourth quarter and year-to-date operations, revenue and EBITDA As Defined were up nicely over last year. Q4 GAAP revenues were up 14% versus prior year Q4 and up 9% versus prior year-to-date. EBITDA As Defined margin ran close to 50% of revenue in both periods.","Now let's review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2018. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. Please note this analysis excludes the recent acquisition of Kirkhill, which will be included going forward in 2019 for comparison purposes.","In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up close to 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. In our commercial OEM market, Q4 revenues increased approximately 6% when compared with Q4 of fiscal year 2017 and were up 1% for the full year. Commercial transport OEM revenues which make up the majority of our commercial OEM business were up slightly in Q4 when compared to the prior year period.","Bookings in the quarter were encouraging and make us cautiously optimistic. Hopefully we will have turned the corner and the softness we have experienced this year in the commercial OEM space primarily due to wide-body weakness is behind us. As we have previously stated, commercial transport OEM sales can fluctuate from time to time, but at its core, our shipset content remains robust so any softness is simply timing related.","Business jet and helicopter OEM revenues make up around 20% of our commercial OEM revenues. In total, year-to-date revenues in this market grew in the mid-teens percentage range compared to the same period in 2017. Year-to-date bookings versus shipments were up in a similar percentage range as revenue growth. We were happy to see growth driven from both the business jet and helicopter segments as both markets picked up nicely in the second half of our fiscal year.","Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 6% in the quarter and brought the full year to 9% growth. In total, 9% growth for the full year was at the high-end of our original expectations. It is important to remember the aftermarket can be lumpy. As we have previously communicated, we think we ran a little hot in the first half of our fiscal year thus driving the second half to be a little lighter.","Commercial transport aftermarket, which makes up about 85% of our total commercial aftermarket, revenues in the quarter were up approximately 5% over the prior quarter and full year revenues grew 9%.","Finally, for the business jet\/helicopter aftermarket which accounts for the final 15% of revenue in our total commercial aftermarket, year-to-date sales growth was up in the low-teens percentage range. This end market performed better than we originally anticipated after an extended period of softness.","In total, our commercial aftermarket performed better than our original expectations. Last November, we also provided guidance for the aftermarket submarkets which make up our commercial aftermarket business. Here in fiscal year 2018 we saw our commercial transport passenger segment come in line with guidance and freight, discretionary interiors, and business jet\/helo all perform ahead of expectations.","Now let me speak about our defense market, which is just over 30% of our total revenue. The defense market which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues was up approximately 12% over the prior year Q4 and up 5% for the full year. Once again, strong defense aftermarket revenue growth was slightly tempered by slower defense OEM shipments, although OEM revenue was strong in the quarter, and sequentially up.","Total defense bookings continue to be up nicely over prior year and have similarly outpaced sales. This expansion is characterized by modest OEM bookings growth and stronger aftermarket bookings performance. Full year total defense market sales and bookings are well distributed and appear to be coming from most businesses that support defense-related platforms.","We believe we started to see some of the strong defense bookings materialize into sales this quarter. However, defense orders can be booked as far out as two years, so the timing of related shipments can be difficult to predict as actual shipment dates can be delayed based upon a number of factors.","Now moving to profitability. I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. EBITDA As Defined of about $525 million for Q4 was up 14% versus prior Q4 and $1.88 billion or up 10% on a year-to-date basis. Full year 2018 EBITDA As Defined margin was 49.2% of revenues. This includes over half a margin point of dilution from the recent acquisitions of Kirkhill, Extant, and Skandia. Excluding these acquisitions, margins improved almost 1 percentage point year-over-year for the same period.","Margin improvement progress is always important to us and indicates that our base business continues to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers.","Now turning to our 2019 guidance also found on slide 6 in the presentation. In general, continued robust global revenue passenger mile growth, a generally positive economic environment, and favorable defense conditions seem to provide a backdrop of accommodating market conditions. Certainly, global trade dynamics, fuel inflation, or other exogenous events could have a negative impact on market conditions for TransDigm. We will watch this situation closely as we always do and will react as necessary.","Based on this, and assuming no acquisitions in fiscal year 2019, our initial guidance is as follows. The midpoint of our fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance is $4.17 billion or up approximately 9.5%. Organic growth is estimated at approximately 6%. As in the past years, with roughly 10% less working days, fiscal year 2019 Q1 revenues, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are anticipated to be lower than the other three quarters of fiscal year 2018, roughly in proportion to lower working days.","This revenue guidance is based on the following market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth of mid-to high-single-digit percent versus prior year. Commercial OEM revenues growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percent range. And defense military revenue growth of mid- to high-single-digit percent versus prior year. The midpoints of fiscal year 2018 EBITDA As Defined guidance \u2013 I'm sorry, 2019 \u2013 is $2.07 billion with an expected margin of 49.7%. This includes approximately one margin point dilution for the recent acquisitions purchased in fiscal year 2018.","Again, we anticipate EBITDA margin will move up throughout the year as we have seen in previous years with Q1 being the lowest and sequentially lower than Q4.","The midpoint of adjusted EPS is anticipated to be $16.26, and Mike will discuss this in more detail shortly.","So let me conclude by stating fiscal 2018 was another good year for TransDigm. We look forward to 2019 and expect that our strict focus on consistent strategy will continue to provide the value creation you have come to expect from us.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.","Michael Lisman - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin. I'll recap the financial highlights for the fourth quarter, the full year, and then also our 2019 guidance. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.05 billion, up about 14% from the prior year. Organic sales were up 7.7%. The balance of the sales increase came from the three acquisitions that Kevin discussed.","Gross profit margin of 56.9% was strong despite the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition related costs. Our GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $4.14 per share in the current quarter compared to $2.21 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter rose 28% to $4.44 per share. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter include $0.69 of favorable impact from the enactment of tax reform. Excluding the favorable tax impact, current earnings per share of $3.75 would be an increase of 8% over the prior year.","Since this is our fiscal year end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some significant financial items for the 2018 fiscal year. Net sales increased 9% to end the year at $3.8 billion in total revenue. Organic sales were up 5.5%. Reported gross profit increased 10% to $2.18 billion and was 57.1% of sales compared to 56.6% in the prior year.","As called out on the slide comments, we netted to one-half point of gross margin improvement for the year, despite approximately one full point of margin dilution from acquisition related impacts.","Interest expense increased by approximately $60 million, up 10% versus the prior year. During the year, we added $1.2 billion of incremental debt, $700 million of term loans and $500 million of subnotes and the higher interest expense reflects this new debt.","Our weighted average cash interest expense was 5.1% and the average LIBOR rate for the period was approximately 1.8%.","Next, I'd like to quickly clarify some tax matters that Nick mentioned at the outset, specifically our lower tax rate for FY 2018 and then the go forward rate for FY 2019.","As you know, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of 2017. The shift onto this new tax regime significantly reduced our expected effective tax rate for fiscal 2018. Our full year 2018 GAAP effective rate was 2.4% compared to 24.9% in fiscal 2017.","We do not expect the low 2.4% GAAP effective rate for 2018 to carry into the future. One-time low rate is primarily the result of remeasuring the U.S. deferred tax liability on our balance sheet to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% from the old rate of 35%. For those who want more detail, the remeasurement of this U.S. deferred tax balance led to a $176 million benefit and then it was slightly offset by $30 million expense on deemed repatriated earnings of our non-U.S. subs.","For fiscal 2018, cash taxes came in at $129 million or a cash tax rate of about 13%. Adjusted EPS was $17.83 per share this year which is up 44% from $12.38 in 2017. Excluding the impact from tax reform of $4.48, the current year adjusted EPS is $13.35, which is up about 8% over last year.","As we look forward to FY 2019, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be about $14.90, as Kevin mentioned previously. And we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $16.26.","One critical point on the FY 2018 and 2019 EPS midpoint comparison that I want to make crystal clear for everyone and overemphasize a bit. The decrease at the midpoint of GAAP EPS from FY 2018 to 2019 is due to the enactment of tax reform and prior year FY 2018. Just like we did on the 2017 to 2018 comparisons we can remove these one-time benefits so that you can do an apples-to-apples comparison of 2018 to 2019. Doing so gets you to 2018 GAAP EPS of about $13.65 if you exclude the one-time tax impact of $146 million or $2.63 per share.","The midpoint of our FY 2019 GAAP EPS of $14.90 would then be a 9.2% increase over this prior year figure of $13.65. Tax reform is having a similar impact on adjusted EPS growth and if you exclude the one-time tax impact of tax reform, 2018 adjusted EPS would be $15.20. The midpoint of FY 2019 of $16.26 would then be 7% higher than this FY 2018 figure after adjusting for the one-time tax reform impact.","Moving to the 2019 outlook, here are some additional details on some of our 2019 assumptions. D&A expense is expected to be approximately $144 million compared to $130 million in FY 2018. Interest expense is expected to be about $745 million in FY 2019. This includes both cash interest plus approximately $27 million of amortization of debt issuance costs and fees. We used an average LIBOR rate of 2.75% for the full year which yields a weighted average cash interest rate of about 5.55%. This is based on current consensus rate expectations going forward which, as you know, could be wrong so we also put in interest rate sensitivity in the appendix for today's deck.","The punch line of the sensitivity is that for each full quarter point increase above the 2.75% expected average LIBOR rate results in about $8 million to $9 million of additional interest expense.","Further, on the interest expense forecasting topic, we've noticed that several analyst models and EPS estimates have us paying down debt over the course of the coming fiscal year and into the future. As we mentioned previously on prior calls, this is unlikely.","For fiscal 2019, our GAAP cash and adjusted tax rates are all anticipated to be in the range of 21% to 23%. We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will increase to 56.25 million shares from 55.6 million shares in FY 2018 assuming no buybacks occur during the year. The increase is due to employee stock options that are vested at the end of FY 2018.","As of our 2018 year end, our net leverage ratio, so net debt to pro forma EBITDA As Defined, was 5.8 times and gross leverage was 6.9 times. We have ample liquidity with over $2 billion on the balance sheet and access to almost all of our $600 million revolver. For our 2019 fiscal year, excluding Esterline and assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market activities, we expect to have about $3 billion of cash on hand at year end. This includes an estimate for CapEx of approximately 2% of sales.","We estimate our net leverage will be around 4.8 times EBITDA As Defined at September 30, 2019, excluding Esterline. And this implies, as Nick said, that we'll delever by about a full turn during the course of the year.","Lastly, a quick note regarding the implementation of revenue recognition standards under ASC 606. This change is having an impact on some of our peers in the A&D industry, so we wanted to touch on it briefly. We've completed an evaluation of this rule change and don't anticipate any material impact on TransDigm's financials at this time.","With that, in closing, we expect our fiscal 2019 be a good year for TransDigm, and I'll turn it back over to Liza.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks. Before we open the lines, we'd like to ask you to limit your questions to two per caller and then reinsert yourself into the queue if you have additional questions left. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Thanks. Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Hey, was wondering, maybe, Mike, to start off on the interest, is there interest income that's embedded in that assumption of $745 million? You're carrying an unusually large or presumably carrying an unusually large balance of cash through the course of the year.","Michael Lisman - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right. We have embedded a small amount of interest income in that calculation.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Okay. And, Nick, how should we think about your capital deployment strategy over the next 6 to 12 months as Esterline's going through the system. It's obviously a big deal out there in the horizon. Should we anticipate you doing relatively de minimis capital deployment over that period of time?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I don't want to answer for the next 6 to 12 months because I don't know what's going to develop there. I would say for the next few months, we still have a reasonably active M&A process. We still see a fair amount of deals, mostly small to medium. I think we'll just evaluate this as the year goes on.","I mean, we're \u2013 because we also are going to have to decide how much of the $3.7 million committed financing to draw and how much of our cash to use, and I think we'll let the clock run a little bit before we make those calls. But as you know, if we decide we have extra cash, we're not going to sit on it very long.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. I'll leave it at two.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So, Mike, with the figures you just gave us, it looks like adjusted EBITDA 2019 growth is around 10%, if I have that right. And I wanted to get a sense \u2013 I don't know if this is for you or for Nick \u2013 how you think Esterline maps against that on a longer term basis?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think we don't own this yet, Rob, and I think we're not going to make a forecast there. I think you know what the 2018 numbers are. I think we told you, you have a rough idea what we're paying and a rough idea of how we're going to finance it and you know that we look for a PE-like return so you can sort of solve back into something there.","I will say probably ramps up a little slower than we might see in other situations.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then just a separate question then, Nick, on the portfolio. There's been a lot of defense awards. Your numbers were quite strong here in the quarter on defense. So, first, if you could touch just again on the volatility in that number and the strength of the back end of the year, is that timing?","And then on some of these new awards, I'm speaking about the trainer, the new helicopter, the MQ-25, how does TransDigm look positioned on those various programs? And again, on Esterline, if you can, how are they positioned?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Nick, you want to take the -","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'll take the Esterline ones. I think this has been \u2013 I know it has. They've said publicly. The trainer, they have a pretty good position on that. The Joint Strike Fighter, they have a pretty good position. I don't know the answer on the other ones. So I can't answer it.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Kevin, I should have asked you as well.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. And the TransDigm, why don't you take the TransDigm question, the volatility and the (30:44).","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, for TransDigm, I think we are involved in the helicopter replacement programs for military, for commercial, the trainer programs around the world, we're involved in these. I can't comment on how significantly one way or the other, but we are involved. We continue to focus on this segment and continue to try to win more than our fair share.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey, good morning, Nick and Kevin, and welcome, Mike.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Lisman - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Two quick ones from me. Kevin, on the comments around the defense strength, I'm not sure if you can answer this, but do you have any insight or color on whether or not those are spares being used or if that you're seeing inventory stocks kind of build back up? I don't know if you can tell by where you ship or what the orders look like, if you're seeing any of a restocking impact there.","And the second one I just sort of wondered if you had any tariff impacts to speak of on any of the subcomponent purchases you guys do for any of the businesses. Thanks.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So first off, I'll comment on the tariff piece. We've looked at this across the ranch and we really haven't seen anything material as of yet on tariffs, imports, and quite frankly, we don't have anything material included in our fiscal year 2019 plan as we go forward.","So on the tariff side of it, I think we have that covered today. What was the first question, again? Can you repeat that?","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Are you seeing, in the military strength, can you tease out of the numbers that there's any sort of inventory restocking there?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I cannot. I would assume there's something going on there, but it's just an assumption. I can't tell by locations. We are seeing strength in defense aftermarket as I commented on and some movement on the defense OEM side, but certainly more growth on aftermarket. But where it's actually going, is it going on a shelf, is it being placed for inventory for usage later, is it going to repairs today? I can't really comment. I don't know.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Yeah, I get it. It's a tough characterization. I just wanted to see if you had any insight. But no problem. Thanks for the color, as always.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us any sort of in the weeds color on the commercial aftermarket, maybe by geography or \u2013 I know you gave it to us by biz jet versus commercial aero, anything you can give \u2013 distribution versus direct to airline MRO or any differences by region that you've noticed, any potential slowdown in China makes that... (34:17).","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't look at commercial aftermarket by region as a first slice. We gave the submarkets and the pieces that make up the commercial aftermarket. I know that there's concern about a slowdown in the second half there. I think we ran \u2013 as we stated, we ran pretty hot in the first half. We were happy that, as the year closed out, we ran ahead of our initial guidance of mid-single-digits and ended up high-single-digits. Beyond that, I don't know what else to offer except across the ranch, we're booking okay in the aftermarket segment, so we are still optimistic as we look forward.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And as my follow-up, I was wondering if you could give us sort of an early read postmortem on the Kirkhill integration. And I know that was part of the reason you had confidence in the ESL acquisition. So if you could talk about some of the improvements you guys have brought to Kirkhill since you've owned it.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Our focus at Kirkhill has been operational in improving on-time delivery and customer satisfaction. So that's been our overwhelming focus with the business. We have seen head count come down. We have seen improvement in the business. We don't get into the specifics of that but to say that we've been encouraged and it's performing well against our acquisition model and did keep us or make us more interested in the Esterline move that we made. So beyond that, I think that's all I can comment on.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Kevin, you mentioned a couple of risks to your aftermarket forecast for 2019, FX and oil specifically. Have you seen these issues having any impact on your airline customer and, say, their utilization of older aircraft as yet?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. In fact, you've seen from the numbers that retirements are down. So I haven't seen that. I'm just commenting that these things could creep in in the future and have an impact. But as of yet, tariffs, nothing material. Fuel, cost increases at airlines haven't seen any anything material in changes to performance or behavior.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then on another topic, on the Esterline, proposed Esterline acquisition, have you had any public feedback from your customers as to what they think of this deal?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's going through the regulatory process, and I just don't want to comment on that. We have reached out and talked to all our customers and, by and large, what we get back is positive. But it's going through a process.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thanks (37:38).","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Just wanted to touch on the aftermarket forecast for 2019 and kind of the level of confidence you have versus the past. It seemed like last year you tried to take a little more conservative tack and this year certainly we see underlying strength in the end market, but right now, it looks like organic aftermarket is running kind of mid-single-digit on mid-single-digit comps and then we go into the first half and we've got kind of \u2013 it seems like we should be accelerating on higher comps. And so, I guess, do you have visibility into the first half that allows you to see that, or should we expect the growth rate to be second half weighted?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Obviously, we gave guidance that said we would be in the mid- to high-single-digits for commercial aftermarket. We have confidence in that because that's what our teams roll up to us. We do a bottoms-up roll-up for the planning process and see how that fits into the different market segments. So I have the confidence that my teams believe this as well as that's what we see in our order book going forward.","So I think we're confident, otherwise we wouldn't have put it out there and that's what our teams believe we will see in the coming year. And I would say teams are generally directionally correct. Things may move one bucket to another, but we have a track record, I think, internally of hitting what we say we're going to do. So I have the confidence in the teams and that's where it comes from that we come with a mid- to high-single-digit guidance around commercial aftermarket growth for 2019.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then the follow-up, just following up on some of Rob's last question, OEMs have been fairly vocal in the past about the contractual remedies they have to move work in the case of acquisitions. Are you taking some of that into account as you do your forecast for Esterline?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You mean the people pull work away (40:00)?","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, exactly.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We wouldn't expect that to happen. It's never predict the future, but we wouldn't expect that to happen. And there weren't any consents required to close this either.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted \u2013 hey, guys. We can come pretty close to backing into it, but I guess I just want to ask about the implied free cash flow growth in 2019. Are you looking roughly in line with the 10% adjusted EBITDA growth, given that free cash flow grew well ahead of adjusted EBITDA in 2018?","Michael Lisman - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think on the free cash flow forecast for the year, we hope we're being slightly conservative as we were last year. But as we said in the comments, we hope to generate about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet during the course of the year.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So roughly, Mike, right around $1 billion in free cash flow?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right.","Michael Lisman - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. And then on Esterline, just to try and put a little bit of finer point on that. I think Rob had asked about the adjusted EBITDA or the EBITDA growth you're expecting. When you model these things, I think, Nick, you've talked about growing, you modeled \u2013 typically model to hit your IRR, EBITDA doubling over a five-year period. Is that roughly what you're looking at here for Esterline?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think there's a couple \u2013 one, as you know, David, I don't want to comment on that. I probably said as much as I can say. And it also wouldn't surprise me if we had some asset dispositions along the way, so it's not as straight a shot and I think that's about as much as I can say.","We feel, for the price we pay, you can pretty well sort of assign a typical kind of leverage we use to it to get the equity, solve it back with a constant \u2013 without any arbitrage and get an EBITDA that solves you back to a PE kind of return and I think you get a pretty good idea what that is.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, yeah, just somewhere in the 20%-plus kind of IRR range? That's what you're looking for?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","About as much as I want to talk about.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thought I would try. All right. Thanks, guys.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You can do the math.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, I've done the math. It looks pretty good. Thanks.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right, David, I think you know the answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys and thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Nick, just to elaborate on Seth's question a little bit more, you mentioned contractual situations in your prepared remarks and level of U.S. employment. I was wondering if you could expand upon those, if at all.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sheila, I lost you in the middle. I couldn't get you.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. You kind of faded out, Sheila.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","I always fade out on these calls, and I'm yelling, trust me. You mentioned contractual situations and U.S. employment in your prepared remarks. Can you just elaborate on that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take them in inverse order. There's a fairly high percent of non-U.S. employment and our view is that's probably going to be a little tougher to get the productivity out of than typically in the U.S. businesses. So that tends to make us pretty conservative on that. Hopefully we're quite conservative, time will tell.","On the contracts, there is some number of, what I call, TINA contracts, that's government price controlled contracts or price controlled. And though not a terrible high amount of them but there's also some LTAs in there with different customers that are less attractive than we'd like to see and we just got to live with them. They'll burn off, but it might be four, five years before they do.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then, Kevin, if I may. You mentioned helicopter and biz jet OE, I think, were up mid-teens. If it's 20% of the commercial OE business, kind of how do you \u2013 it implies that the transport or commercial OE business was down slightly in the year. Kind of what improves in 2019 in your assumptions and how sustainable is the helicopter and biz jet strength?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, good question. I look at the market segment the same way you do. We have strong bookings as we look out into the future on the OEM side and we had strong booking growth. But I, as well as you, am cautious about business jet and helicopter because I think some of the fundamentals are still not yet as strong. But I will ship the orders as they come in but I don't have any more guidance beyond it.","We have a decent order book going into next year and that's the guidance we've given on the helicopter, biz jet. But again, market fundamentals don't seem like they're so much better. Do you get what I mean there? I mean we're not seeing taking off and landings cycles in biz jet really growing. It seems to have stalled out at 1% growth a year. Yeah, it's growing but it's not as exciting.","So as I look forward, we have confidence in the 2019, but it wouldn't surprise me if some things move around there.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Maybe Kevin, just \u2013 good morning \u2013 just to stay on the commercial OE, if I'm looking at the outlook for next year, low- to mid-single-digits, you've got a lot of rate increases on the narrow-bodies, the 787, the 350, some of the pressure on the wide-body debate. And obviously you just talked maybe fundamentals aren't as strong as you think on helicopters and biz jet.","I would have thought the growth rate would have been higher with some of those larger platforms, not seeing as many declines and the narrows ramping. Is it more just conservatism on the biz jet and helicopters, or was there a lot of product in the channel for the rest of the commercial OE transport side?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we hope we're conservative in our guidance here. I don't have anything additional on the split. We saw some commercial transport OEM growth in commercial transport sector. We saw some growth when you factor out biz jet helicopter on OEM. So the second half of the year, it started to pick up on the bookings side on OEM. I think we're comfortable with low- to mid-single-digit percentage up. And if the wide-bodies continue to turn around, we might prove to be conservative here.","Again, our shipset consent has not changed. We're still continuing to expand our shipset content as we go through the years. So we've not seen any departure here, so it has to be timing related. And it will come out as the orders come to us. I don't have any additional visibility than you have except to say that in the second half of the year our bookings on commercial transport OEM picked up quite a bit in the second half of the year.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Does that answer your question?","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That does. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up to where David was going on Esterline. If we look at that EBITDA that they have, $330 million, as you guys sit here today it sounds like you've got a lot of the lessons learned from Kirkhill. Does more of the EBITDA growth come from cost cutting and productivity, or is there an equal opportunity on pricing and maybe expanding their positions in the marketplace?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, a couple things. One, the $330 million by the way just to be clear, that's the consensus, that's the public consensus 2019...","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...EBITDA, that's not what we're endorsing or not endorsing. I would say the improvement comes from the whole cross-section of activities we understand when we buy a business. I think I told you a little bit in the prepared script why, even though they've been flat for the last three years, we think the next few years just on a sort of an organic basis looks a little better. I think I gave you the reasons why we think that.","I think the other aspects, some comes from the things we always do. We're a little \u2013 in all parts of that, I'm hopeful we're conservative. I'll say again, in a public buy, you don't get as much detailed diligence as you do in a private buy, and that tends to make you more conservative in your assumptions.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it.

My name is Sheila, and I'm your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please proceed ma'am.","Liza Sabol","Good morning, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2014 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Ray Laubenthal; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC. These filings are available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Good morning, and thanks, everybody, for calling in this quarter to hear about our company. Today, I'll start off with comments, as usual, about our consistent strategy, then an overview of a busy fiscal year '14, our financial performance and market summary for '14 and initial guidance for fiscal year '15. A fair amount to cover here today.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle.","To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products, and around 3\/4 of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Over 1\/2 of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability in the downturns. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structure flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value drivers concept. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system with executives and senior management who think, act and are paid like owners. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we can see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as another means to create shareholder value.","We have been in the past, and continue to be, willing to lever up where we either see good opportunities or view our leverage as suboptimum for value creation.","In keeping with that philosophy, we returned about $1.6 billion to the shareholders in fiscal year 2014, primarily in the form of a $25 per share special dividend and some related payments, and also a modest share buyback. This total payout was about 20% of the market equity value at the start of fiscal year 2014. As part of this effort, we successfully refinanced our capital structure and borrowed approximately $3.4 billion. Almost 1\/2 of this was used to pay the dividend I previously mentioned.","The majority of the balance we used to refinance the 7 3\/4% bonds to reduce the interest expense, extend the maturities and increase flexibility. In deciding to pay out another special dividend this year, as usual, we looked closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have 4, and our priorities are typically as follows: one, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; three, giving the extra back to the shareholders either through a special dividend, most often or, at times, a stock buyback; and last, pay off debt, though given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is likely our last choice in current capital market conditions.","After paying the most recent special dividend, buying back about $160 million of our stock, making 2 acquisitions for $310 million, we still closed fiscal year 2014 with $820 million in cash, about $400 million in unrestricted and undrawn revolver and additional capacity under our credit agreement. We ended the year with a net leverage of about 6.2x EBITDA. At 9\/30\/14, based on current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $2 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for fiscal year 2015.","Interestingly, since the beginning of fiscal year 2013, we have returned about $3.6 billion or almost 50% of the market equity at the start of fiscal year 2013 to the shareholders. In that same time frame, we made 5 acquisitions for a little under $800 million, we fully supported our existing businesses and maintained a healthy cash balance and significant dry powder for acquisitions.","As you may have seen, we announced a few significant management changes recently. Ray Laubenthal decided to retire after 21 years with TransDigm. Ray has been involved in most major decisions and activities with me at TransDigm since the formation of the company. He has been a key part of building the company. Ray remains a significant investor in TransDigm, and we intend that he will move to the board early in calendar year 2015.","The board and I regularly discuss succession planning for the CEO, senior executives and key operating unit managers. It's an essential part of our long-term value generation efforts. As we reflected on our growth -- as we reflected on our growth in long-term succession planning, the board and I thought that it would be advisable to add a few additional high-caliber executives to our senior management team.","In keeping with that plan, we hired Kevin Stein to be a Chief Operating Officer of our power segment. This segment makes up about half of our business. Kevin is an impressive senior aerospace executive with extensive operating experience. He comes from Precision Castparts, an aerospace company I respect. It's well managed and has consistently generated substantial shareholder value. We gave some additional background on Kevin in the recent 8-K and press release. Kevin is a high-caliber upwardly mobile addition to our management team. He's coming into a job that will allow him to quickly learn both our business and also contribute meaningfully to our value generation activity.","Additionally, Bob Henderson, the new COO of the company's airframe business group, has been a key member of our team for the last 20 years. Bob has also been a significant partner in the company's growth and brings a unique understanding of our culture, history and value creation process. Bob has been closely involved in most major decisions and activities at TransDigm for many years. He's been an Executive Vice President for years and responsible for a broad range of the company's businesses and many acquisition integrations.","As you may know, I have recently extended my contract through 2019. TransDigm has no mandatory retirement age nor do we have any specific timing for me to transition out of the CEO role. My contract does have a mechanism for me to become an active executive chairman, if that is appropriate at some time. At such time, as my transition to Executive Chairman becomes appropriate, we will pick the best available internal or external candidate for the CEO job. To be clear, we have no fixed time schedule for CEO transition nor have we settled on a specific successor.","Now to summarize fiscal year 2014. 2014 was a busy year. As I said, we raised and distributed significant amounts of capital. We acquired Airborne Systems and EME for $310 million, and we continued the integration of our various other acquisitions. All the while, we contribute to generate real, intrinsic value in our new and existing businesses and create shareholder value.","Turning to our 2014 performance. I'll remind you, this is the fourth quarter and full year summary for fiscal year 2014. Our fiscal year ended in September 30, 2014.","As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by differences in OEM, aftermarket mix, large orders, transient inventory fluctuations and modest seasonality and other factors. But after a bumpy 2013, the commercial aftermarket recovered nicely in 2014. The total company GAAP revenues were up 19% versus the prior Q4 and 23% on a full year basis. Organic revenues were up 10% on a quarter-versus-quarter basis and 8% on a full year growth basis.","Reviewing the revenues by market category. Again, on a pro forma basis versus the prior Q4 and prior full year -- this is Slide 5, by the way. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 7% versus the prior Q4 and 8% on a fiscal year basis. This is primarily driven by commercial transport OEM revenues, which were up 12% on a full year basis. The commercial transport growth primarily reflects increasing production rates. Biz jet, helicopter and GA revenues were, in total, about flat year-over-year.","After a softer 2013, total commercial aftermarket revenues recovered well in fiscal year '14. On a Q4 versus prior Q4 basis, revenues were up 18% and up 12% on a full year basis. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up even higher percentages. However, this was offset by biz jet, helicopter and GE aftermarket revenues -- Oh, I'm sorry, biz jet, helicopter and GA aftermarket revenues, which were up only very slightly. Sequentially, revenues were up modestly.","The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenue. Defense revenues were about as anticipated. Revenues were up 3% versus the prior year fourth quarter and roughly flat on a fiscal year versus fiscal year basis. Excluding Airborne, defense revenues were up 6% for the full fiscal year. Defense revenues were spotty by unit. With no clear trends, though more were up than down. Fourth quarter defense bookings were down significantly versus the prior Q4. Year-over-year bookings were about flat. We saw weak Q4 military bookings in most of our operating units. Though the world doesn't seem safe, given the -- doesn't seem too safe, given the uncertain political situation and the lumpy bookings, we remain cautious about trends in the military.","In total, for fiscal year '14, our revenues for commercial aftermarket ended up a little better than we expected, while the commercial OEM and military revenues were about the same as we expected at the start of the year.","Moving on now to profitability and, on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q4 were noncash compensation expenses and some acquisition-related costs.","Our EBITDA As Defined of about $291 million for Q4 was up 17% versus the prior Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA As Defined was $1.07 billion or up 19% from the prior year. The EBITDA margin was about 40 -- As Defined was about 45% of revenue for both Q4 and the full year. The full year margin, without dilution from the impact of the 5 acquisitions purchased in '13 and '14, was approximately 48% or up 1% versus fiscal year '13. With respect to acquisitions, we continue actively looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is active. The closings have been slow. We have seen a fair amount of activity recently, but the closings are always difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on value creation that meets our tight criteria.","Moving now on to 2015 guidance, and I believe this is Slide 6. Once again, the military situation is unclear. I know that sounds like a broken record, but that's how we see it. The commercial aftermarket appears to recovery -- to be recovering nicely as we head into 2015. This is our best current estimate. As you know, we'll update this as the year proceeds. But based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions in fiscal year 2015, guidance is as follows. The midpoint of the 2015 revenue guidance is $2.53 billion or up about 7% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. The fiscal year 2015 Q1 is currently anticipated to be lower than the other quarters, roughly in similar percentage relationship as fiscal year '14. The midpoint of the 2015 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.17 billion or about 46.5% of revenues. That is up 9% in total year-over-year. We anticipate EBITDA margins will move up throughout the year as we've seen in previous years. The base business, that is, excluding the same 5 most recent acquisitions I talked about just a minute ago, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of a little over 49% or up a bit over 1 point. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $8.16 a share or up 5% versus the prior year. This is negatively impacted primarily by higher interest rates and, to a lesser degree, the higher tax rates. Greg will go through some of the details with you on that.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions. Commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the high single digits based on worldwide RPM growth in the 4% to 5% range. We're a little cautious here due to both tough comps as the year proceeds and also some pretty heavy buying in the second half of fiscal year 2014.","The defense and military revenue is estimated, again, to be about flat versus 2014. We'll continue to evaluate this as the political situation unfolds. Given the world events, there could clearly be some variation here, but recent bookings have been broadly weak, and the military and political situation is unclear. In summary, this all leaves us pretty uncertain.","The commercial OEM revenue growth is anticipated to be in the mid-single-digit percent range primarily due to the 2015 and '16 commercial transport production rates. Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have almost $1.3 billion in cash, a $400 million undrawn revolver at year-end 2015. Again, assuming no acquisitions or other capital structure activity, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.2x EBITDA at the end of '15. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement.","In summary, 2014 was a good year. I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors.","And now let me hand this over to Ray who will discuss some operating high points of fiscal year 2014. And Ray will also sign off. To quote a famous politician, after this call, \"You won't have Ray Laubenthal to kick around anymore.\"","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thanks, Nick. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fourth quarter and a good finish to another very busy year. The consistent application of our value drivers and the successful integration of our recent acquisitions continue to add solid value to TransDigm.","Let me explain in a little more detail our fiscal 2014 and fourth quarter operational value creation.","Although the commercial transport market is on the upswing, we've continued to tightly manage our cost structure, and we were able to continue to reduce our pro forma total headcount. Our continuing productivity efforts include consolidating certain acquired manufacturing operations, strategically sourcing material from efficient domestic and offshore sources, moving various manufacturing operations to Mexico, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and China facility and investing in our existing manufacturing facility, keeping them up to date and productive.","2014 was also another record year for new business orders. We continue to provide innovative new business solutions to our broad customer base. We have successfully expanded our platform content with significant new business in both the commercial and military markets.","I would like to briefly highlight one of the significant new business programs we were awarded during the second half of 2014.","In the commercial transport market, we have continued to provide engineered solutions and expand our content on the new platforms. On prior calls, I spoke in detail about our new business awards on the A350 program. Those design programs have continued to progress well, and we are now bidding on and developing engineered products for the new engine options on the Airbus and Boeing fleet.","On the A320neo, our Arkwin unit's providing the engine fans, cowl latches and engine nacelle hold-open rods. Our Harco group is providing the engine fan case temperature sensors. Our Champion aerospace group is providing the ignition system on the Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1100G geared turbofan engine option. And on the 737 MAX, Hartwell is also developing the engine nacelle latches and thrust reverser latches. They're also developing the pressure relief doors for the engine pilot [ph].","And on the 777X, it's in the early stages, and we're quoting many of the similar engine-related accessories, power products and engine nacelle and cowling latches and hinge applications as listed above.","We're being told by Boeing and Airbus -- we're being told, Boeing and Airbus are targeting to primarily just upgrade the existing Boeing 737, Boeing 777 and the A320 platform with more fuel-efficient engines. We expect the vast majority of the airframe configuration to remain the same as the legacy aircrafts. That being said, we expect our numerous existing engineered product applications on those platforms to remain in place and our shipset content to remain stable or increase modestly.","Also, during the second half of fiscal 2014, we continued to supply the commercial airlines with interior upgrades. Our Schneller unit recently was awarded Boeing 777 cabin interior laminates and seat laminate refurbishments at KLM, Air France, Singapore Airlines and China Eastern. Our AmSafe unit continued to get new applications of their airbag seatbelt restraint system primarily used in the first class and business sections when the new seat configurations are pivoted or angled.","And our Bruce lighting group has been awarded energy-efficient, bi-color LED lighting at Delta on their Boeing 737 and 757 fleet. They're also providing new LED cabin lighting at Swissair and Canada Jet Airlines -- CanJet Airlines, excuse me.","In the military market segment, our Arkwin unit was awarded the hydraulic system reservoir for the upper and lower rotors on the new joint multi-role helicopter that Boeing and Sikorsky are designing. On the predator drone, our Aero Fluid Products group was awarded the extended range fuel valves. On the C-130J, our Avionic Instruments unit is supplying an upgraded regulated transformer rectifier unit and also a frequency converter system to supply hospital-grade 230-volt electrical power for essential airborne medical equipment. And our recently acquired Airborne North America unit was awarded the reentry vehicle parachute system on the Boeing commercial crew transport capsule. They also continue to receive large orders for their new T-11 and MC-6 military parachutes. The normal progression of their product sales are, first, to the U.S. government, which occurred in prior years, and then they roll out their products to our allies. So far this year, Israel, India and Jordan all placed orders for the T-11 and MC-6 parachutes. All these orders will ship out in fiscal '15. Airborne's newest ram-air parachute, the RA-1 had orders in 2014 totaling $24 million from the U.S. government. The bulk of these new orders will also ship in 2015, and we expect the RA-s1 will also eventually be sold to our allies.","These new engineered solutions from our operating units, and many others not discussed, continue to expand our profitable product offering and add to our future growth. In fiscal '14 -- 2014, we also acquired 2 proprietary aerospace businesses: Airborne Systems and Elektro-Metall Export. We quickly went to work transitioning these businesses into TransDigm's value-creation mode. To provide better product focus, we split the Airborne Systems business into 2 separate operating units: one, in North America, focusing primarily on the military personnel parachutes and cargo system parachutes; and one in the U.K., focusing primarily on parachute aerial delivery systems and electronic warfare. As we have done with each prior acquisition, we applied our proven value-creation processes. One, we restructured the businesses into product line focused groups and implemented our value-creation metrics. And we focused the engineering and new business efforts on winnable and profitable new business. And we tightened up the cost structure. Lastly, I'd like to say my 21 years working with the team at TransDigm has been exceptional. I believe our TransDigm business culture is truly unique. We work hard creating a lot of value and have a hell of a lot of fun working with each other. I intend to continue as a significant investor as I move on to the TransDigm board. I'll enjoy watching the continued growth and success of this great company.","Now let me sign off, and hand it over to Greg, who will review our 2014 financial results in more detail.","Gregory Rufus","Thanks, Ray. Nick already summarized the key events that occurred in FY '14. So I will now review the consolidated financial results, starting on Slide 7, for our fourth quarter and then give a brief fiscal year summary.","Q4 sales were $642 million and 19% greater than the prior year. Our organic sales were 10% higher than last year, driven primarily by strong growth in commercial aftermarket and, to a lesser extent, commercial OEM and defense sales.","Reported gross profit was $349 million or 54.3% of sales. The reported gross profit margin was approximately 1.9 margin points higher than the prior-year margin of 52.4%. Although margins in the current quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 1.5 margin points by acquisition mix from Airborne and EME, this was more than offset by decreased nonoperating acquisition-related costs versus the prior year. These costs consist primarily of inventory step-up and start-up expenses.","Excluding all acquisition activities, our gross profit margin in the remaining business versus the prior-year quarter improved approximately 2 margin points. The base business has continued to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and to continually improving our cost structure.","Selling and administrative expenses were 11.9% of sales for the current year -- for the current quarter compared to 11.3% for the prior year. The current quarter was running a little higher than the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition mix, but was about flat for the full year after excluding stock comp expense and acquisition-related costs.","Interest expense was $97 million, an increase of approximately $16 million or 20% versus the prior year quarter. This is the result of a 32% increase in the weighted average total debt to $7.5 billion in the current quarter versus $5.7 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was due to the third quarter dividend financing discussed earlier.","The weighted average cost -- cash interest rate on the total debt at the end of the current quarter is approximately 4.9% compared to 5.4% at September 30, 2013.","Our effective tax rate for the year was 31.6% for fiscal 2014 compared to 32.5% for fiscal '13. The lower current year tax rate benefited from some favorable foreign tax credits. Our net income for the quarter increased $30 million or 36% to $114 million, which is 18% of sales. This compares to our net income of $84 million in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the growth in net sales and lower nonoperating acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the higher interest expense.","GAAP earnings per share was $1.91 per share in the current quarter compared to a loss of $0.20 per share a year ago or an increase of $2.11. 3\/4 of this increase is attributable to the dividend equivalent payments made in the prior year. The current quarter included dividend equivalent payments of $0.11 per share compared to $1.67 paid in the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per share was $2.21 per share, an increase of 26% compared to $1.75 per share last year. The increase in adjusted earnings per share is higher than the increase in EBITDA As Defined of 17%, primarily due to the benefit of the lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Again, please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP to adjusted earnings per share.","Since this is our fiscal year-end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some significant items. Net sales for the year increased $449 million or by 23% to end our year at $2.4 billion in revenues. Acquisitions contributed approximately 65% of the increase in sales, and our organic sales were strong at 8% above the prior year. Reported gross profit increased 21% to $1.27 billion and was 53.4% of sales compared to 54.5% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition activity and stock compensation expense, our full year margin versus the prior year improved approximately 1 margin point.","Selling and administrative expenses of 11.7% of sales for fiscal '14 is lower than the 13.2% of sales in fiscal '13 due primarily to lower noncash stock compensation expense. Additionally, the current year includes lower acquisition-related costs. Excluding noncash compensation expense and acquisition-related costs, selling, general and administrative expense was about 10.5% of sales for both periods.","Net interest expense increased $77 million due to the additional debt incurred to fund the quarter third dividend of $25 dividend -- I'm sorry, of the 2014 $25 dividend discussed earlier and the July 2013 financing associated with last year's $22 special dividend. Despite increasing total debt, we decreased our weighted average cash interest rate for fiscal 2014 to 5.3% compared to 5.6% in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $7.76 per share this year, up almost 13% from $6.90 per share a year ago. The increase in EBITDA As Defined of 19% was partially offset by higher interest expense and share count.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity.","The company generated $540 million of cash from operating activities, and we closed the year with $820 million of cash on the balance sheet. The company's gross debt leverage ratio at September 2014 was approximately 6.9x pro forma EBITDA and 6.2x on a net basis. All things considered, we believe FY '14 was another great year for TransDigm and our shareholders.","As we look forward to fiscal '15, we estimate that the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $7.64. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $8.16. As we disclosed on Slide 9, there are $0.52 in adjustments to bridge GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. In addition, there are a few other items for FY '15.","Depreciation and amortization, that's including backlog amortization of approximately $2 million, is expected to total $83 million in 2015 compared to $96 million in '14, which included backlog amortization of approximately $17 million. Interest expense is expected to increase 15% to approximately $400 million in FY '15. We use the weighted average cash interest rate of approximately 5.1%. Interest expense includes an additional $20 million related to interest rate swaps. Our effective tax rate for FY '15 is expected to be around 33%. Our cash taxes will be approximately $180 million.","We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will decrease slightly to be approximately 56.6 million shares, reflecting the shares we repurchased in FY '14. As a result of these items, our adjusted earnings per share of $8.16 is approximately 5% greater than FY '14.","Finally, with regards to our liquidity and leverage, we expect to generate $475 million of cash, which includes higher capital expenditures of approximately $60 million or 2.4% of sales. This is higher than our historical run rate. The increase supports 2 significant capacity-related projects at Schneller and AmSafe. Again, assuming no other acquisition activity, we expect our gross debt leverage ratio to be approximately 6.3x EBITDA As Defined, and our net leverage ratio will be nearly 5.2x our EBITDA As Defined at September 30, 2015, or de-levering approximately 1 full turn.","Now let me hand it back over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have a question -- well, first, best wishes to Ray. I'll start with that.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thank you, Rob.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask -- I have a question for Nick and for Greg. Greg, I just want to start with you. When I think about the gross margin improving in the quarter and the EBITDA As Defined declining, it sounds like the difference there is the SG&A, I guess, associated with the acquisitions, to some extent, because you don't have acquisition costs in the quarter. And does -- is that the basis for the improvement, the 100-basis-point improvement in margins next year, the absence of that SG&A? Or is it pricing or both? That's the question for Greg.","Gregory Rufus","Well, I know our SG&A consolidated is lower as a percent of sale in 2015. I think it's 11.9% and it's going to drop to 11.3% or 11.4% next year. So we'll get improvement in SG&A, and it was up a little because of acquisition mix. The other part of the question, Rob?","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to understand if I've got that right, that the SG&A is the reason you've got one margin rising and the other one falling. Or -- and then also, is there any pricing component to the improvement in margins next year?","Gregory Rufus","Rob, I'm not following because I don't know if you're going quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year here, but our interest...","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, that's the point. It's odd to see gross margins improve and EBITDA As Defined margins decline in Q4, to begin with, especially in a quarter where you're citing lower acquisition-related costs, which would go into the, I assume, into the SG&A.","Gregory Rufus","Rob, this is a lot of reconciling. Maybe we could take this after the call or offline because...","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so let me just ask the back half of that one again. The 100 basis points next year, is that the absence of this SG&A or is it pricing or is it both?","Gregory Rufus","It's both.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Hold it, can I just stop a minute. 100 basis points is -- I threw a couple of margins around. So let's be sure we're talking about the same one.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","EBITDA As Defined goes up about 100 bps into the low 46s, I think.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes, got it. The other one I threw around, Rob, was the -- if you pull out the 5 acquisitions, most recent, I gave you the margins for the base businesses that we had going into '13, how they did year to year to year. I was trying to give you a sense of what the base was doing.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. No, and that's fair, Nick, what I'm trying to figure out is what pricing is doing.","Walter Nicholas Howley","The pricing, Rob, is the normal kind of pricing we get. There's no change in our pricing patterns.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then that being the case, the 18% was mostly volume in the quarter on the aftermarket?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Well, the 18% is, as you know, Rob, we don't disclose the pricing in our different segments. The 18% is a mix of -- it's the normal mix of unit and price.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, but it sounds like it's more...","Walter Nicholas Howley","I think you're -- if you're trying to back me into the price, it isn't going to work.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough, Nick. High-level question, this next one was intended to be the question for you. Since the spring, we've seen public aerospace valuations all over the map, largely on cycle noise and the like. You guys have held up very well but some of the others haven't. Are depressed valuations in the sector making certain assets more attractive now?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I can't -- I can't say that's true. I think the answer is no to that, Rob. And at least none that I specifically know of.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And congratulations, Ray. So I just wanted to -- if you could give us some more flavor on the aftermarket, that growth rate is high and higher than even last quarter, which also was high. Can you talk a little bit about any sort of trends within that aggregate number? Are you seeing any regions that are particularly strong? Any types of products, either discretionary or nondiscretionary...","Walter Nicholas Howley","I can't say there's significant difference between the discretionary and the nondiscretionary. It's a rising tide right now. If you look at our units, almost -- not all, but almost all of our units are up. As I said, I think in the press release, and little bit when I talked about the guidance for next year, I'm a little concerned that we're running out ahead of ourselves. 15% and 18% is not a sustainable number, and if you -- I don't think, and if you peel back, as I mentioned, and you look at the commercial transport, which is where the bulk of the numbers are, that's rising even faster. Because, as I said, the biz jet helicopter and GA stuff is about flat or slightly up. So I think it could be a little ahead of itself, and it's pretty broad.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Broad regionally as well?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And maybe if you could just give us some flavor on -- you've announced a -- or you authorized a share buyback, but you also talked a little bit -- I think a little bit more positively about some of the M&A prospects. And maybe if you could just give us some flavor on how that pipeline has changed, if it has, relative to 3 and 6 months ago. Can you talk about are you seeing more stuff and maybe more internationally? However you want to answer it.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes, let me first answer on the stock buyback. All we did there was we had $200 million of authorization, of which, we used about $160 million of it. So all we did there was just refill the -- we just refilled the availability. I wouldn't draw anything from that. We had $2 million [ph] before, I think I now have $250 million. That's just reflective that the company's a little bigger so we approved a little more. We have no specific plans other than we may well opportunistically buy things from time to time. So that answers that. The M&A activity, yes, we got -- we see a little more activity now. We see -- clearly, we see more activity in Europe but we see some in the U.S., too. I have no ability to predict when or, if any, of them will close, but we're more active now than we were, say, 3, 4 months ago.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And could you comment maybe on the size of this -- on the size of the opportunities...","Walter Nicholas Howley","Not a heck of a lot different. We've seen some not real big, but we've seen some on the -- a little bit on the larger size. I mean, not -- I'm not talking hundred millions of EBITDA, but most are more in the normal range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Nick, hoping to kick off maybe talking about the leverage situation, obviously, ending the year above your normal historical level at 6.2x EBITDA As Defined. Are you comfortable up at this level? Could you potentially take it higher? Or do you see it moving down towards more normal historical levels going forward from here?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Rob, I think that's very dependent on the capital market situation, where our outlook is for acquisitions. I don't think, over the long haul, our kind of range is changing but, as you know, the credit markets have been uniquely accommodating for the last 12 to 24 months. So we'll take a look at that over the next 3, 4, 5, 6 months and see what the future looks like and see what it looks like. I don't -- I wouldn't want to get -- I wouldn't want to get committed into a band or a number one way or the other just because the market has been so accommodating.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Are some of these potential discussions open to then moving the leverage even higher? But again, depending on the market.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Say that again?","Gregory Rufus","Which discussions?","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, so you said you're constantly looking at the market, but is it possible that you have discussions that allow you to raise your leverage above the current level as you talk to potential lenders?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Oh, we could surely -- we could lever up. I mean, the market would allow us to lever up higher than the current level. The market would allow us. That's...","Gregory Rufus","Our credit agreement allows us...","Walter Nicholas Howley","And our credit agreement would allow us to go up to 7 1\/4%. That's not to say that we want to do it, but that's what the situation is.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, secondly, on the aftermarket. You mentioned that things might have gotten a little bit ahead of themselves in 4Q. Do you detect that some of your airline customers are starting to restock or complete some deferred maintenance that they put off?","Walter Nicholas Howley","A combination of those. A combination of those. I mean, we were at 15 and 18 [ph] so what's that? Average 16.5 [ph]. And if you peel off, you throw out the business jet and helicopter business, it was up higher than that. Well, the underlying consumption is not that high. So there is a mix in which I can't exactly draw a beat on it, but there is some mix of some deferred maintenance and some stocking in there. Now there was clearly a de-stocking and a deferral in '13, so we likely are just catching a little of that back up.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Seth on the line for Joe this morning. I wanted to ask a question about defense. You've got it to flat, which I think you've got it around there in the past and you guys typically take a pretty conservative approach, I think based on what's gone on in the market there. But it sounds like there are some tough trends with regard to bookings in the fourth quarter. What sort of gives you confidence in getting to flat? Are there sort of some good things that are happening in defense this year that should offset maybe some of what you're seeing now on the bookings front?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Well, it's only a one down quarter, and we've seen down quarters before in the bookings, so we don't want to overreact to it. But I will clearly say it's uncertain and unclear. If you look at what's going on in the world, you would expect you may see some pickup in defense ordering activity for repairs and spares and replenishment, things like that. So we were a little surprised that we haven't seen them, and that makes us cautious. But I would tell you, if you told me it was 5% one way or the other, I would say I can't call it that close.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the biz jets and helicopter and GA, I guess, particularly the biz jet. Flat on the OE and it sounded like modest growth in the aftermarket...","Walter Nicholas Howley","Very modest. Very modest.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What's baked into your expectations for '15 in both the OE and the aftermarket side?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Kind of a continuation of the normal, not much recovery.","Seth M. Seifman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You're not seeing much of a biz jet recovery at all?","Walter Nicholas Howley","We're not -- we're not -- I mean, maybe a little bit but not a lot. I mean, someday, we will see a pickup in that, but it's been out in front of us every year for the last 3 or 4 years, so we're a little wary of it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of Canaccord.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to first ask just again, on the aftermarket, what percentage of your business is for engine versus other parts of the plane? And can I -- when I look at the segments that we really don't ever talk about, but when you look at the power side, is that largely all engine related or is that other parts of the plane as well?","Walter Nicholas Howley","It's all kinds of power, it's not just engine. I don't know the exact number but frequently, they say an engine makes up -- and the claptrap that goes with it, makes up 25% to 30% of the plane. I suspect we're somewhere in that kind of range.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And would it be fair to say you've maybe seen those products, from a volume standpoint, doing a little better than other products in the aftermarket or is that...","Walter Nicholas Howley","No, I can't say that. Could be. That's not clear to me, and I don't know that, that's the case.","Kenneth Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. Okay, now that's helpful. And if I could, the slight step-up in investment to support some of the new programs in fiscal '15, does that roll back down again in '16 or you may be looking at maybe a couple years here of a little more investment considering some of the wins or incremental opportunities you've had, specifically on A350 and some of the other programs that Ray outlined?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I don't know that I would change the go-forward forecast. Frankly, we haven't -- I don't know of anything discontinuous in 2016. But honestly, we haven't looked very closely at it. It won't materially change the cash flow one way or the other. So -- but I don't think we're setting a new level, but I just can't tell what 2016 is yet.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ciabattoni of KeyBanc.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Ray.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thanks.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to go to the aftermarket again, Nick, any changes you see over the next year in maybe airline purchasing behavior, especially given if oil prices kind of stay down here at current levels? And maybe any thoughts on where provisioning heads next year, especially with the A350 certification yesterday.","Walter Nicholas Howley","On the oil, I mean, you know the traditional rule of thumb is if the oil prices drop down, they keep the old planes running longer and that would tend to give you a little more aftermarket. Whether that'll happen, I have no idea how to speculate on that. But that's the traditional wisdom. I don't have a good view for the A350 provisioning, and we clearly don't have anything baked into our forecast.","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked a little bit about M&A. I mean, I guess just looking at the other side of that, anything you're looking at -- I mean, is there any potential for portfolio reshaping from your side, looking at noncore assets within the portfolio right now?","Walter Nicholas Howley","You mean for selling things?","Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Walter Nicholas Howley","I don't think so. I mean, we don't have any immediate plans, but that's not to say we couldn't sell something small if it didn't fit [ph]. But we don't -- we have no immediate plans to sell anything.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Congratulations, Ray.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thanks.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So your -- Nick, your adjusted EBITDA guidance, I know you guys targeted 10% to 12%. Today, you put out 8% to 10%. I mean, is this just conservatism? I mean, is there anything out there that you see stopping you from getting to kind of the normal 10% to 12% adjusted EBITDA growth?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Other than the guidance we gave you.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right.","Walter Nicholas Howley","I mean, I think the guidance we gave is the guidance we gave. Could there be some upside? Of course, there could. Could there be some downside? There could. But I think, I've got to stick, David, with the guidance we gave.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, and just along those same lines, I think you said in your prepared remarks that the base business kind of, excluding acquisitions, the adjusted EBITDA margins are going to be up 100 bps, which is in line roughly with the overall guidance for adjusted EBITDA. What are you, therefore, implying for the recent acquisitions? Are the adjusted EBITDA margins there flattish? Or when -- I would think there'd be...","Walter Nicholas Howley","No, they're moving up some, too. They're moving up some, too. Frankly, I haven't solved back into that math. Have you, Liza? I haven't solved back into it.","Liza Sabol","I don't have it here.","Walter Nicholas Howley","But I know they're up some.","Liza Sabol","We are. They're up.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Greg, on the cash flow side, are there any major moving pieces in -- on the working capital side that we should be aware of next year?","Gregory Rufus","Less from operating working capital. I think you'll notice, though, our cash taxes will be higher next year than this year. Just a little color on the CapEx, our normal DSOs and inventory turns should be as normal.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, you said cash taxes next year $180 million. Where did they come in this year?","Gregory Rufus","Under $100 million. This year, as a percent of the provision, it was like 70% and next year, it's 80%. So I thought it was working those [ph] out.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So the first one was on the core margin expansion into next year, the 100 basis points x the 5 acquisitions. Is it similar margin expansion between power control and the airframe segments? Or is the implied EBITDA incremental margins, which look really good, more indicative that you're going to have faster growth in power control and faster expansion there?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I wouldn't draw any particular distinction. They're both picking up. I wouldn't -- I don't think there's a particular distinction to be drawn there, Myles.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And do you -- the cautionary tone on 1Q in defense, I mean, how much of that is the really tough comp you have in defense in 1Q versus kind of what you see as a deterioration in the underlying demand?","Walter Nicholas Howley","I don't know how to parse that out. Clearly, the fact that we have a bad comp coming into the year is not a plus. So I just, I don't know how to parse those 2 out, Myles.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But sequentially, the bookings are deteriorating -- did deteriorate this quarter?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Yes.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","They were high in Q3...","Gregory Rufus","In defense. In defense, yes. Defense bookings were surprisingly down this quarter and broadly down. Not just if you looked at 1 unit, you get [indiscernible] order before and now it went away, it's broadly down.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","In Q3.","Gregory Rufus","Yes, yes.","Walter Nicholas Howley","Now we've seen that before and have it just remedy itself 90 days later, but...","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. No, that makes sense. And then last one, though, is so you're starting the year at a high single digit guide for aftermarket and in prior years you, where you've had a tough comp, you usually start at a mid-single-digit range and -- but it sounds at the same time like you have -- you're running superheated in the second half. You must have a pretty good sightline into the first half, continuing to be superheated?","Walter Nicholas Howley","Well, I don't want to comment on the quarterly. What I would say is we're a little concerned that we're coming out of the year heated up.","Operator","And we have no more questions. I'd like to hand back for closing remarks. Thank you.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, all, for calling in today. And I'd just like to note that please look for our 10-K that we expect to file sometime tomorrow. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"20784":["TransDigm Group, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you. I'd like to thank all of you for calling in today and welcome you to TransDigm's fiscal 2017 second-quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie. A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks and details are contained in this morning's press release on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, we would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC, available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","We'd also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release or a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, now, let me turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks to all of you for calling in. Today, I'll start off as always with comments about our consistent strategy. Then, I'd like to give a little more color on commercial aftermarket business and few other topics relating to Q2. Then, I'll give a quick summary of fiscal-year 2017 Q2 performance and an update on 2017 guidance. Kevin will review more specifics on Q2 and then, Terry will run through the financials. This may take a little longer than usual.","To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and about three-quarters of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.","Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced higher gross margins and provided relative stability through the cycles.","Our long-standing financial goal is to give shareholders, over time, private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To meet our goal, we have to stay focused on the details of operating management, value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet and allocation of our capital.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based around our three value driver concepts. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns us with the shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And fifth, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value.","As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have four; our priorities are typically as follows. One, invest in our current businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy and return requirements; third, give extra money back to the shareholders, either through special dividends or stock buybacks; and fourth, pay off debt. Again, given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice, at least in current capital market conditions.","Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions that exist at the time, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders.","We look at our stock as another potential investment alternative. Depending on the price, specific other opportunities and the overall business environment, the returns from buying our own stock could be, at times, more attractive than other opportunities we may see. To that point, our stock price became very compelling in the last quarter. As a result, we acquired about $340 million or 1.5 million of our shares at an average price of $224 a share. We expect the multi-year return here to meet or exceed our rigorous return requirements.","To update you on a few significant items in the second quarter, let me first address the commercial aftermarket, both for this quarter and also, more significantly, over a little longer-time horizon. For the quarter, the aftermarket revenue comp was down 1.5% versus a difficult comp in the prior year. This obviously isn't a great number.","However, the bulk of the negative impact is due to a few specific businesses. There are also some significant positive indicators this quarter. Specifically, most of our businesses showed decent year-over-year growth in the commercial aftermarket.","The overall softness is substantially due to 4 of our 34 businesses, our 2 more non-proprietary cargo net and container businesses and, recently, our 2 more discretionary interior businesses. Kevin will give you a little more detail on that. Excluding these 4 businesses, the balance of our commercial aftermarket is up in the mid-single-digit percent, both versus prior-year Q2 and also on a year-to-date basis.","Also, year-to-date, our commercial aftermarket bookings, in total, across all our businesses are running well above the shipments for the year. Also, in Q2, our look-through distributor shipments picked up significantly versus the prior-year Q2. These factors make us feel more positive about the second half of the fiscal year, but they don't change the fact that first half was weak in this market \u2013 our sector.","I'd also like, and I think this is of more significance, to give some color on our commercial aftermarket and the trends we and the industry have been seeing over recent years. Commercial aftermarket revenues, in real terms, that is excluding price across our peer group, have been growing well below RPMs for a while now. Just of interest, we do not include the commercial transport engine manufacturers as our peers.","As we look at the publicly disclosed peer comps on commercial aftermarket and make some estimated adjustments for pricing, it appears to us that across the group, there has been almost no real or unit growth, on average, for the last five to six years. The last three years look about the same.","The largest segment of our commercial aftermarket, and that is a little under 70%, is driven by the commercial transport passenger planes. This piece has been growing in real terms. The other 30%, which I will explain, has not been growing.","We believe the TransDigm aftermarket growth, after adjusting for price, over this five to six-year period has been a little higher than the peer group. That is up in the low-single-digit percent. Again, that is excluding pricing.","We have heard the softness over this period, attributed to many factors, including pooling of inventories, surplus parts, PMA parts, deferred maintenance, et cetera. Though we can't speak for other companies, when we look at our businesses, some of these points are worth clarification. One, we are comfortable based on a series of outside consultants and our own analysis that our aftermarket shipset distribution is just about market-weighted.","Secondly, on pooling in inventory reductions, we don't see how this can be a significant factor over this extended time period. It's just been too long. We also hear little mention of this from our operating businesses.","Third, with respect to surplus part usage, based on our investigation, we believe penetration is minimal and we don't see any material changes or increases here. As we've discussed before, surplus parts for our type of products and price points don't seem to be a significant factor. We understand that the unit price in the $7,500 to $10,000 per unit is sort of a rule of thumb for surplus parts usage. The vast majority of our parts are priced well below $5,000 a unit and well below the price points. We estimate the average price for our parts is far below $5,000. In addition, our quantities are low.","Fourth, with respect to third-party PMA parts, as I think you know, almost all parts of TransDigm's type require a PMA to sell into the aftermarket. TransDigm has a pool of well over 400,000 part numbers made up of end items, subassemblies and components available for sale under its numerous PMA approvals. As a reminder, when a top assembly is approved by the FAA, the components making up that assembly that are included in the component maintenance manual are also approved by reference.","Over 300,000 of these part numbers sell with some regularity. Almost all of these PMA-approved part numbers are for our proprietary parts, originally designed in the new OEM aircraft or as field retrofits of some kind, often for plane interior programs.","For the last five years, we have been averaging over 20,000 new PMA end items, that is subassemblies, components or parts per year, for sale into the aftermarket. We estimate that third-party PMA penetration into our, that is TransDigm's aftermarket, is less than 2%. We believe this has been flat to down as a percent of our commercial aftermarket over the last five to six years and, therefore, has not materially impacted our year-over-year growth.","It appears that other factors have been influencing real or unit demand. I'm going to talk about unit growth here. Again, I'm always excluding price over the last five to six years. The last three-year trend has been similar. We found it difficult to make much sense out of changes over shorter periods of time. In total, due to the high percent of new airplanes and the overall mix of our aftermarket, RPM growth doesn't appear to be the right overall metric, at least at this point in the OEM cycle.","Commercial passenger transport aftermarket, as I said, makes up a little under 70% of our commercial aftermarket revenues. The unprecedented length of the commercial transport production cycle has resulted in a lower growth rate in the out-of-warranty fleet. We define out-of-warranty as planes over five years old. These planes, the under five years or five years and under, consume far less of our parts and services. Due to the large number of new airplanes, the growth in fleet size of planes over five years appears to be growing at roughly 3% a year for the last five years or so. These planes also tend to fly less hours per day, likely exacerbating the impact.","This growth rate should increase as new production rates slow down or decline. Most forecasts we've seen expect a slow increase in the growth rate for this group over the next several years. TransDigm's real or unit growth, again, without price, in the commercial transport passenger segment has been in the low to mid-single digits per year, generally in line with the fleet growth in planes over five years old.","The balance of our commercial aftermarket, that is a bit over 30% of the aftermarket revenue, is made up as follows. Cargo handling and freight make up a little over 15%; freight traffic over the last five years or six years, depending on what index you use, appears to be flat to slightly up; freight capacity looks to be flat to slightly down.","Our freight aftermarket has been impacted by this and, exclusive of price, has been slightly down in real terms. The less proprietary container and net businesses have been quite soft. The aftermarket in the proprietary cargo systems has been slightly up.","As a reminder, our cargo systems are sole-sourced on every Airbus airframe, except the A380, and also sole-sourced on the Boeing 747 freighters. We also provide passenger and freight conversion on a range of airframes. As an aside, in total, our acquired Telair Cargo businesses are running well ahead of our acquisition value-creation model.","Business jets are the next largest piece. Again, exclusive of price, the business jet aftermarket over the period has been roughly in line with takeoff and landings. That is flat to very slightly up. Helicopter and GA combined make up the balance and they're, in total, a little less than business jet revenues; this is in the aftermarket. In real terms, these have been down in the mid-single-digit percent per year over this last five to six-year period.","Over this period, this has netted out to a low-single-digit real unit growth rate for TransDigm's commercial aftermarket. As best we can estimate, excluding price, this appears a little better than the industry average. Though there will always be some cyclical swings by quarter or individual years over the next three to five years, we'd expect the percent of the fleet over five years old should slowly pick up. The freight aftermarket, though too early to be sure, appears to be mildly picking up and I hope the business jet and helicopter markets have bottomed out. This should bode well for commercial aftermarket over the period that the pick-up could be gradual, especially if the commercial transport production rates continue to grow.","As you probably know, we've gotten a fair amount of publicity last quarter about our U.S. Government business. To remind you, direct sales to the U.S. Government make up about 7% of our revenue. This is including sales through distributors or brokers. Two congressmen have written almost identical letters to the DoD Inspector General, asking him to review TransDigm's government contracting practices, following a report published on the Internet by a research firm. We have not received notice from the Inspector General Office that it has commenced any investigation or audit at this time. If they do begin any audit or investigation, we will cooperate fully as we have in the past.","A 2006 IG review and audit of certain government agency purchasing practices included the review of purchases made from TransDigm. Inspector General audits or investigations of contracting parties are not unusual in this industry. Over time, many suppliers, both large and small, become involved one way or another in some type of IG audit or investigation. As we do for acquisitions, going forward, I'm not going to discuss or comment on this topic unless the company determines to make a public announcement.","This quarter, we were again active in the capital markets. As I mentioned, we invested $350 million to buy back our own stock.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","$340 million.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Oh, $340 million, excuse me. We also raised $300 million of high-yield debt to reload, to take advantage of a good price for fixed debt and to confirm our ready access to the market.","Last quarter, Standard & Poor (sic) [Standard & Poor's] (19:29) upgraded both our fixed and variable rate debt as well as our overall corporate ratings. We also amended our credit agreement to allow us over a 12-month period to either buy about $1.5 billion of our stock or payout $1.5 billion of special dividend. We have about $1.3 billion of this authorization still unused.","As we have explained in the past, 75% of our debt is either fixed or capped. The net result is to significantly reduce our exposure to interest movements through at least 2021.","At April 1, 2017, our liquidity was strong. We had slightly under $1 billion in cash, about $600 million of open revolver and additional room under our credit agreement. We believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1 billion of acquisition. This grows steadily through the year. This does not imply anything about likely levels of acquisitions for the year.","In Q2, we completed the acquisition of Schroth Safety Products and certain other aerospace assets from Takata Corporation for about $90 million. This business primarily manufactures multi-point restraint harnesses in Germany and the U.S.A., used primarily in commercial pilot and flight attendant restraints as well as certain military and racing applications. The products are primarily proprietary and have significant aftermarket.","Our acquisition effort remains active. The pipeline is, as usual, mostly small and mid-sized businesses. And closings, as always, are tough to predict. Kevin is going to review the Q2 operating performance and a few other items, but a few comments.","Year-to-date, all of our market segments are booking ahead of shipments with the commercial aftermarket defense segment bookings are running well ahead of shipments. On the same-store basis and assuming we own the same mix of business in both periods, commercial OEM revenues were up modestly in Q2 versus the prior year. Commercial transport revenue is up more, but slower business jet and helicopter revenues pulled the overall down.","As I said before, commercial aftermarket revenue was down 1.5% for the quarter. I already spoke about this, but Kevin will give a little more color. Defense revenues were up versus both the prior-year Q2 and year-to-date. Defense bookings were up very substantially in Q2 versus the prior year. EBITDA As Defined operating margins were strong and up 2% versus both the prior-year Q2 and year-to-date as we continue to execute on our steady value-creation process.","Based on the year-to-date results, full-year 2017 guidance, assuming no acquisitions or additional capital market activity, is adjusted as follows. The midpoint of fiscal-year 2017 revenue guidance is now $3.55 billion, a slight increase of $5 million versus the previous guidance. This is due to the Schroth acquisition, partially offset by a modest decrease in the base business forecast.","We anticipate 3.5% to 4% organic revenue growth for the year. As usual, the fourth-quarter revenues should be higher than the third quarter. The midpoint of fiscal-year 2017 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.7 billion. This is an increase of about $5 million from our previous guidance. The modest increase is due to both the Schroth acquisition and a slight margin improvement in the base.","We have now increased the full-year EBITDA by $20 million from our original 2017 guidance. The vast majority of this increase was from improved operating performance. The midpoint of our EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $12.21 a share, up about $0.05 a share from our previous guidance. This increase is due to the increased EBITDA, a lower share count, offset in part by higher interest expense. And Terry will expand on that a little bit.","On a pro forma or same-store basis, the revised guidance is based on the following growth rate. Commercial aftermarket growth in the mid-single-digit percent versus the prior year; the strong bookings are encouraging, but the first-half revenue was light. This is a modest decrease from our original guidance.","Defense or military revenue is up-low-single percent versus the prior year. This is a modest increase from our original guidance. Commercial OEM revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range, this is unchanged. We have significant cash and available borrowing and these continue to grow throughout the year. Terry will expand on this. The first half of 2017 was solid. We look forward to a good second half.","In summary, at this point, it looks like, for the year, the commercial aftermarket could be a little lower than originally anticipated and this is mostly offset by a modestly higher defense sector.","And with that, let me turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. Now, let me touch on the details of the quarter. For Q2, total company GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong, with a revenue up about 10%, EBITDA As Defined about over 14%. EBITDA As Defined was strong at 48.2% of sales. The strength in EBITDA as a percentage of sales was due to the continued realization of our value-driver concepts across our base businesses and from the continued integration of recent TransDigm acquisition.","Now, let's review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis versus prior-year Q2; that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods, similar to a same-store sales metric.","In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion to OEM and aftermarket. In the commercial OEM market channel, revenues were up approximately 2% versus prior Q2. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the majority of our commercial OEM revenue, were up about 4% versus prior-year Q2. Bookings year-to-date for this segment have increased modestly versus first half of prior year and have outpaced fiscal-year 2017 sales by a similar modest amount.","Business jet and helicopter revenue make up about 15% of our commercial OEM revenues. In total, year-to-date revenues in this market are down modestly compared to the first half of fiscal year 2016. Given the performance of this market recently, this result was not unexpected. However, bookings grew sequentially in Q2 and have outpaced shipments by over 5% for the first half of 2017.","However, any optimism for this sector is tempered by business jet and helicopter OEM forecasts. We see that inventory management by our OEM customers and rate reductions on some wide-body platforms have created headwinds in the commercial OEM market, but we believe this is all timing-related as our shipset content has not changed. We will continue to watch OEM booking trends for any indication of weakness, which will allow us to further modify our cost structure as necessary.","Now, moving on to commercial aftermarket, total commercial aftermarket revenue was down approximately 1.5% for Q2 fiscal-year 2017 when compared to prior-year Q2. As Nick previously stated, this was a difficult comparison quarter, as our commercial aftermarket revenue demonstrated 13% growth a year ago in Q2 fiscal-year 2016.","For the current quarter, commercial transport aftermarket revenues were down less, with a slightly larger decline in business jet aftermarket. Again, a difficult quarter to compare, as Q2 fiscal-year 2016 demonstrated a significantly higher revenue growth rate than the rest of fiscal-year 2016.","As Nick commented previously, the vast majority of our business demonstrated Q2 revenue growth in commercial transport aftermarket. Four businesses make up the bulk of the decline and these can be grouped into two categories, partially non-proprietary freight products from Nordisk and AmSafe nets. Here, they serve as a competitive market segment, which has experienced oversupply and pricing levels we have occasionally been reluctant to match.","And secondarily, our more discretionary interiors business at Schneller and Pexco, these businesses, who largely support cabin aesthetics, have recently experienced some market softness.","For commercial transport aftermarket, year-to-date bookings now exceed shipments by approximately 8.5%. This strength in commercial transport aftermarket bookings was met for the first time in a while, with the business jet and helicopter segment displaying bookings in excess of shipments by over 6% year-to-date.","We remain cautiously optimistic on the commercial aftermarket for two simple reasons. First and foremost, bookings have outpaced shipments year-to-date in the high-single digits for the entire commercial aftermarket segment. And point-of-sale information from our distribution partners or look-through sales demonstrated well into double-digit growth in Q2 of fiscal-year 2017.","Now, let me speak about our defense market, which remains relatively unchanged at about 30% of our total revenue. Total defense revenues for fiscal-year 2017 second quarter, which include both OEM and aftermarket revenues, were up about 3% versus prior-year Q2 and year-to-date. The story for Q2 continues to be one of strong defense aftermarket revenue growth, tempered by slower defense OEM shipments, which are timing-related.","However, total defense bookings provided an encouraging narrative as bookings have exceeded shipments by over 8% year-to-date, led by a strong rebound in OEM order book in Q2 and continued defense aftermarket expansion. It should be noted that Q2's defense OEM order book was bolstered significantly by a large multi-year order for Whippany Actuation Systems on a confidential platform. Lumpy bookings and shipments like these are common in the defense market and caution must be used in forecasting off a few data points.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q2 were non-cash compensation expense, acquisition-related cost, amortization and refinancing costs.","Our EBITDA As Defined of about $421 million for Q2 was up 14% versus prior Q2. The EBITDA As Defined margin of 48.2% of revenues for Q2; EBITDA margin, excluded the dilution from the impact of acquisitions purchased since 2016, was over 49% or up approximately 2 margin points versus prior period, indicating again our base businesses continue to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers and recent acquisitions are coming up the curve quickly.","As I transition to discussing some operational details, I thought I would articulate one of our business goals. Operationally, our goal is to always supply our customers with well-engineered reliable products and, of course, these products must be delivered on time. This is the real value of TransDigm to our customers. Operationally, we perform.","In recognition of this, I thought I would finish off by providing a little color on two of our key value drivers for TransDigm, that of driving productivity and achieving profitable new business across the company.","As we have previously discussed, TransDigm invests fully 7% of our total costs on engineering. We define total costs as total revenue minus EBITDA. This engineering investment drives our product development and cost-reduction initiatives and here are a few examples of this investment bearing fruit.","Across TransDigm, through our focus on productivity and investment in our businesses, we have been able to strip out just under 4% of our head count fiscal year-to-date. Re-engineering our methods, capital investments in new processes and equipment, outsourcing procurement initiatives and plant consolidations at Elektro-Metall and Airborne Systems North America are a few examples of what has driven this cost reduction.","This means we have removed 8% to 9% of our head count over the last 18 months while maintaining our engineering programs and effort. For the profitable new business development, at AeroControlex, the team has developed a portable, quick-turn water disinfection cart for all major aerospace platforms. This product allows treatment of the onboard water supply to sanitize the system without the need for harsh chemicals. This product is seeing acceptance across the globe as more than 50% of the world's largest airlines have already adopted this product and more are in current evaluation.","At Aerosonic, the team has recently received a large award from the U.S. Coast Guard to outfit the search and rescue Eurocopter MH-65E Dolphin with a new retrofit glass cockpit instrument display. This system, called Oasis (34:02), replaces multiple mechanical gauges with only highly reliable, highly accurate display systems.","The system is lighter, easier to install and eliminates much of the maintenance calibration for older mechanical gauges. At Nordisk, our freight cargo container manufacturer, they have recently designed and received a large, new business award from Amazon for the production of a new, robust, lightweight specialty cargo container for use on all of Amazon's internal freight shipments. This could have considerable future additional volume opportunities as Amazon continues to grow its delivery capability.","At Adams Rite Aerospace, the team developed and manufactured the complete lightweight ballistic cockpit door module for the A350. This award represents significant shipset expansion for Adams Rite and is beginning to bear fruit as the A350 build rates accelerate. This system now includes the controller, the keypad, door deceleration devices, ballistic door itself, door posts and intrusion-resistant locking mechanism.","Finally, AdelWiggins has made a significant investment to develop composite lightning isolators. This investment has resulted in AdelWiggins winning significant shipset content on many new aircraft. These aircraft include the A400M, 787, C-Series and the new 777X and Global Express 7000, 8000.","The composite product line has grown quickly and is now AdelWiggins' largest product line. As illustrated by these examples, our engineering investment, coupled with our rigid, new business tracking process by business unit and platform, has allowed a culture of innovation to prosper and realize consistent growth opportunities into the future.","So, let me conclude by stating, all-in-all, Q2 of fiscal-year 2017 was another solid quarter for TransDigm.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I will now review our financial results. Second-quarter net sales were $873 million or approximately 10% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions of DDC, Young & Franklin\/Tactair and Schroth contributed $70 million of additional sales for the period.","Our organic sales were up approximately 1%. Our second-quarter gross profit was $491 million, an increase of 15%. Our reported gross profit margin of 56.2% was almost 3 margin points higher than prior year. Gross profit margin increased almost 1 margin point due to the lower non-operating acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these costs, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior-year quarter improved almost 2 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products continually improving our cost structure.","Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.9% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and non-cash stock compensation, SG&A was about 10.2% of sales compared to 9.7% of sales a year ago. The higher SG&A was primarily related to higher selling and admin costs related to recent acquisitions.","We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $37 million, up 33% versus prior-year quarter. This is a result of an increase of 33% in the weighted average total debt to $11.2 billion in the current quarter versus $8.4 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was due to borrowing an incremental $1.9 billion in June 2016, $1.2 billion in November and $300 million in February.","The proceeds were used primarily to fund acquisitions, pay off our highest-rate 2021 bonds, pay a special dividend and repurchase our own stock. We are currently assuming an average LIBOR of approximately 1% for the current year, which then yields a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.2%. If LIBOR were to increase to 4%, our weighted average interest rate would increase by just under 1% to 6.1%. This would increase our after-tax interest expense by approximately $70 million. We now expect our full fiscal 2017 net interest expense to be approximately $600 million.","Moving on to taxes, in Q4 of fiscal 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for share-based payments, including stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments. As a result, our GAAP tax rate will now generally approximate our cash tax rate during an entire fiscal year.","Our GAAP effective tax rate was 27.7% in the current quarter compared to 29.4% in the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter was primarily due to higher adjustment for the excess benefits from the option exercises. We still estimate our full-year GAAP tax rate to be around 28%. Excluding the accounting standard change, our effective tax rate is still estimated to be around 31%. To remind you, this is the rate we use in calculating our full-year adjusted EPS.","Our net income for the quarter increased $14 million or 10% to $156 million, which is 17.8% of sales. This compares to net income of $142 million or 17.8% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales and lower acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher interest expense versus the prior period.","GAAP EPS was $2.78 per share in the current quarter compared to $2.52 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $3.02 per share, an increase of 5.6% compared to $2.86 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.","Now, switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $985 million of cash on the balance sheet. There were several items Nick's previously reviewed that impacted our cash balance in the quarter. We opportunistically completed a financing for an incremental $300 million of senior sub notes due in 2025 at a rate of 6.5%.","As for uses of cash, as Nick previously mentioned, we repurchased 1.5 million shares during the quarter. As a result, we now expect our full-year weighted average shares to decrease to approximately 55.6 million shares. In March, the board authorized a new $600 million share repurchase program to replace the existing program. At the end of Q2, we had $410 million available for additional repurchases under the program.","We also paid approximately $90 million for the acquisition of Schroth. Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activities, we still expect our cash balance at September 30, 2017 to be around $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. We also expect to have roughly $600 million in undrawn revolver and additional capacity under our credit agreement.","The company's net debt leverage ratio at the quarter-end was 6.2 times of pro forma EBITDA As Defined and gross leverage was 6.8 times. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2017 to be approximately 5.7 times, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions.","With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of the GAAP earnings per share to be $9.28 and, as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $12.21. Increase in adjusted EPS of $0.05 is primarily due to the increase in EBITDA As Defined and lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense. Please see slide 10 for a bridge detailing the $2.93 of adjustments between GAAP to adjusted EPS related to our guidance.","Now, I'll hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Terry. Before we start, I'd like to just ask that all of our analysts only ask initial, two questions at a time and then please reinsert yourselves into the queue, so that we can get through everyone's initial questions.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And thanks for the color on the aftermarket. Looks like you hired some good consultants. I know you're tracking ahead of sales in terms of orders by 8.5% year-to-date on bookings for aftermarket. Can you give us some color on year-on-year first half versus first half in 2016?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know. Liza, do you have it?","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Sure. On the bookings (43:56)?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Myles, let's move on. We'll look it up for you. Okay?","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, no, that's fine. And then, the commentary you provided on the restructuring, the 8% reduction in head count, I imagine that's a pro forma basis of what you acquired over the course of the 18 months. Can you give us some color as to kind of excluding the acquisitions, what the level of productivity you're able to still get out of your core business? And obviously, there'd be low-hanging fruit in some of the acquisitions. So, I'm just trying to get at what's kind of still there on the core business that's run for an extended period of time already.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, Myles, we still look at the \u2013 our goal in these businesses is to squeeze inflation out of the cost structure every year, even the old ones. And what we mean by that is to try and squeeze about 3% of the cost out. Now, I don't say we hit it on every one, but on average, we still get that out of most of the businesses.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I would also say, if the market turns down, I'm pretty comfortable \u2013 this is primarily, I would say, the commercial OEM market. If that turns down, I'm pretty comfortable that we can move our cost structure down in line with that, assuming some reasonable turndown.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. I gave you two. So, I guess I'll stick there.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, all.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Nick, I wondered if you could expand a little bit on the commentary around the discretionary stuff in Schneller and Pexco and maybe tell us if that was anything related to particular models or market segment. I would assume that Schneller is more wide-body value oriented, but Pexco, I thought was primarily sky interiors on the 737. So, anything you can tell us about what you saw there?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I would say Schneller is wide-body-only, because it's just a function of square footage. They got more square footage on wide-body. I mean, it's on all the platforms. You just got more wall space on a wide-body.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, the weakness you saw there is wide-body related sort of by definition?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. We have just seen slowdowns in a number of programs. Honestly, I can't peg them for you, not because I'm not willing, just because I don't know the answer.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But you are right that Schneller in dollar volume \u2013 well, no, I'm not even sure of that. Per plane, it's more impacted by wide-bodies, but in dollar value, I think, they're pretty market-weighted. I think it's pretty market-weighted. Pexco, the best growth opportunity is those blue sky, that's where most of the growth come, but they're across all Boeing airplanes; not Airbus by the way, Boeing.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, clearly, you scrubbed the data on the aftermarket pretty hard. I don't know if you got a sense in going through that analysis, how your parts that were more cycles-based versus usage-based in terms of the replacement decision there; was there any difference and just in general terms about how those parts trended in growth in your analysis?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Over the period, I can't say there were. I can't say there were. I mean, I felt \u2013 again, I'm going to talk now about the commercial transport passenger stuff, which is the big chunk of it. I think what we found \u2013 as I said, Carter, that the closest proxy at least looking back is the growth rate in the out-of-warranty fleet.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll stick too.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Nick, thank you for the aftermarket color. Can you just expand on the dynamics with the ages of fleet and maybe where you're seeing certain model weakness and maybe where you're seeing a pickup with the 787s? Are they starting to see some overhauls or not yet?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not significantly, not significantly. I mean, I think, you can go back and do the same math. I mean, you can look at where our production airplanes are growing and where they're not. That's where we're seeing it too.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","787, I can't see \u2013 you're not kicking much in yet. There is not enough of them getting outside of the window, well, I'd say the five-year window.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, just a quick one for Terry. Given you expect the cash balance to go back to $1.4 billion for year-end, are you taking a little break for the remainder of the year and just letting that cash balance build up or how should we think about the capital deployment?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we are always looking at our pipeline from an acquisition standpoint. And again, you can't determine when these deals will close, but we want to deploy the cash as efficiently as possible. So, again, not knowing when the potential acquisitions could close, that's where we would be at the end of the year. That's how I qualified my comments.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think I might add, as usual, as we move through the year, we'll look at our pipeline. Frankly, we'll look at the price of our stock. We'll look at what other opportunities and we'll decide, decide whether we keep the money or whether we get some back out to shareholders in some fashion.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hello.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Nick, I appreciate all the aftermarket color. Just wanted to follow up. I mean, I guess, implied or what wasn't said was as you look at the analysis you've done that you don't see much of an impact from, I guess, any sort of changes in airline behavior or all of the anecdotal evidence we've heard about in terms of airline just getting more cost conscious. Is that a fair statement? It sounds like it's really just your commentary really is just a reflection of (50:35).","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, Ken, what I tried to do is \u2013 and hopefully I made myself clear \u2013 was knock off some of the things that we have seen hypothesized at least for our business. Again, you have to remember, as I said, the unit price of our stock is pretty low. We don't get a lot of volume. There's no significant concentration. There is a ton of part numbers. So, we don't see the surplus of any significance. We don't see the PMA.","As I said, the pooling, i.e. the inventory drawdown, I think that may be a viable explanation, though I don't have any good date on that for a year or so. It can't be for five years, I don't think. So, I think that's probably the best answer I can give you.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. No, that's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, I mean, obviously, you've been into this market a lot longer than a lot of us. I know you really, I mean, looked over the last five to six years, but do you think the last five to six years you saw a step change relative to periods prior to that or difficult to say at this point?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think the primary thing \u2013 and I'm now, to some degree, in the hypothesis mode, backfitting the answer to the data, I think, for TransDigm, the two significant things are, one, whatever it is coming on 14-year run up of our new airplanes, production rates, has interjected an unusually high percent of airplanes in the under five-year life, which depresses, I think, the rate of growth or the rating usage for spares and repairs. I think that is probably number one.","And I think the second is, the mix of TransDigm's aftermarket, whereas if you went back 10 years ago, I don't know, but I would guess it was 80%, 90% commercial transport per passenger, is now 70%. There is more other stuff in there. I think those are probably the two factors.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I do think, if you had a more traditional expansion contraction cycle and production rates, they maybe ran up five years, ran down five years, up five years. I think you drift back closer to the RPM number.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, no, that's very helpful. And if I could, just finally, on the defense side, DDC in particular, can you just comment on how that's performing now? We're coming up obviously close to the anniversary for that. It seems like it's been doing well and should benefit from a lot of the fundamental backdrop, but can you specifically highlight that acquisition?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we don't give out numbers on individual operating units, but I can tell you that we are still tracking just fine our value-creation model. We buy it. We have to see a PE-like return and we put together a model that does that and that's tracking that nicely.","Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. I'll stop there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Nick, this may sound like splitting hairs, but is it possible to actually give us the precise start time of the window, the multi-year window, that you analyze there?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. You noticed that I kept saying five, six years?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But you might have noticed that five, six years was not one number.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's right.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","What we did, Noah, is we did it over six years and we did it over five years. And depending where you made the cut-off, you got a somewhat different answer. So, we just averaged the two.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Yes, I mean, the reason I ask is your business had such a high growth rate in the sixth year ago, that comparing your total growth to what you're talking about for volumes, ex-price, makes a big difference in trying to make that comparison. So...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we averaged the two. Though I have to say, I'm just looking at the data right now, as you talk, Noah, if I look at 2011, almost everybody was up above the mid-teens.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, right.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So, anyway...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But if you're giving me an industry number for that window on units or your number for that window on units and then I wanted to compare your total growth to that, your average, it's makes a big difference if I'm using five or six. And therefore, that variance is different.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And that's why we took the whole industry, Noah, and averaged them too. We took five and six, added them up, divide by two.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That helps.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's just because you had a funny number when you did one or the other.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Noah, I'll say again, I'm just looking at this chart, the numbers that everybody are way up in that first year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Well, I think, you're still coming off global financial crisis at that point in time.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Could well be.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It seemed a little bit removed from it, but I don't know.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Could well be.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","On the cash flow statement, I guess, year-to-date has been a little better than the normal first-half seasonality. What are you guys looking for, for the full year for free cash flow?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think we guided to, it was around $750 million to $800 million at the beginning of the year and I think our expectations are still there. We haven't come off of that and at this point in time, I think we're still in that line. Last quarter, we guided $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion for end-of-year cash balance. You can back out the free cash flow to-date and you can do the math on the back half of that, it will get us there.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","When I'm doing that math, should I have literally zero between CapEx and the bottom of the cash flow statement? Just because there's so many line items in there that are extremely hard to predict and I don't know what you guys have in getting to that cash balance. Do you know what I mean?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, the way to look at it is \u2013 I think what we talked about is take our EBITDA number and we like to be over 50% on conversion to cash after cash interest, which we have said that it should approximate cash taxes, cash interest. Cash tax will approximate the GAAP rate and then you can determine your free cash flow. Then, you have a couple \u2013 a little bit of working capital to that, but we still expect to be that free cash flow around $800 million for that year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, year-to-date, I think we're just at around $350 million something. So, you can see it back-end loaded as it typically is.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is getting to $1 billion of free cash flow next year in the scenario analysis?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're not going to comment on next year quite yet. We've got to finish up this year. So, you'll know that when we come out with our forecast for next year in Q4.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I would guess, Noah, I don't think, you've kind of pays your money and takes your choice on what next year's EBITDA forecast is.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think the percent cash spin-off changes substantially. If anything, as the net goes down a little, you might get a little more.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, if you take our midpoint and grow that EBITDA by 9%, 10% (58:19) and then do the 50%, you'd probably get to where it would be.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right, except the EBITDA growth, as you were, at least historically on average has been much better, but, yes, now I got you. Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Interesting data, Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Want to touch on the EBITDA margin guidance. I think you're 47.8% in the first half, calling for 48% for the full year. So, some improvement in the back half of the year, but, yeah, between more volume and based on your guidance, it looks like a better aftermarket mix. Why don't we see even better adjusted EBITDA margins than what you're calling for in the back half of the year?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. We got a little bit of a down-pull from Schroth. So, that isn't real big, but it pulls you down a little bit and that's our best judgment now. We'll see how it plays out. I mean, if you take out Schroth, it's not inconceivable to be a little better.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, on the aftermarket bookings running ahead of shipments for the year, how good of an indicator are \u2013 is that bookings number of what we're going to see on a go-forward basis? In other words, kind of how much visibility does that provide you versus how much do you have to just so short-cycle that you don't really ever see it in your bookings number?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. We're surely not booked up. We're not booked up for the balance of the year. So, there is some risk. There is some risk, but when we put the combination of the bookings running ahead and we're also \u2013 we think it's a positive that when we look at our major distributors, their point-of-sale is picking up or has picked up pretty significantly through the quarter, the mix of those two gives us some confidence. But I mean, I don't want to be deceptive here, we're not booked out through the end of the year yet.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, got it. All right. I'll stick to two. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Nick, you did mention pricing in the quarter and I imagine you had your usual calendar-year price increases. I was wondering, if you could comment on whether anything unusual had occurred there.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't \u2013 I think the price dynamics in our business and in our markets, in our segments is \u2013 there's nothing odd about this quarter.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And that goes to defense versus civil versus biz jet?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That was across the company. Honestly, Rob, I can't tell you segment by segment by segment if there's any variation, but in total, the pricing dynamic is not different than it typically is.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then \u2013 and secondly, in the past, you've commented about inventory destocking perhaps being one of the issues in the aftermarket. Now, you've done more analysis of that. Do you think that's no longer an issue and this concept of younger aircraft being more efficient is much more important?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, I didn't say necessarily more efficient. What I said is, well, I guess, I did, but I said they are in the, what I call, warranty period and during that period, they consume very few parts, at least of our kind of parts. They're either covered by warrant. Here, they just \u2013 frankly, just don't use this stuff. I would expect, as they come out of that five-year period, they would start to pick up their consumption. Now, could there be a little bit of efficiency? Maybe, but I don't have a good sense of that yet. I don't think it's substantial once they get out of that sort of a happy window.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So, generally, less concerned about spares on the shelves of the airlines or the distributors then?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's right. At least over this time period \u2013 Rob, what I tried to say is I just don't see how that could be a significant factor over a five-year period.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","There couldn't be that much inventory in the system. Then also, I have to say, we don't hear that from any of our operating units.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","All right. Thanks for everything.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey, Matt.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, again, appreciate the insight on the commercial aftermarket volume drivers. Could you touch on whether there are comparable structural issues impacting price? And I guess, you can back in commercial aftermarket price in the, I guess, low-single digit kind of range over the past five years. Can you touch on whether there are big factors driving that either direction?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not sure I follow your question, Matt, but I'll give it a try. I would say the pricing dynamic in the commercial aftermarket has not changed materially over that period. Is that your question?","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, essentially. I mean, there are a lot of important factors impacting your volume once you shared a lot of good insight into. But, I guess, is the pricing component of your revenue growth in commercial aftermarket over the past five years, is that moving higher or lower within that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think it's changing substantively.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I don't want to be cute about that, just to be clear. The pricing dynamic in the commercial aftermarket and our ability to get results has not changed.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, just a quick follow-up. Did you repurchase stock since the end of the second quarter? I guess, it was around $220 million (01:04:58) in April. I don't know if that would have triggered your 10b5-1, but...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I can't talk about anything, Matt, beyond the quarter.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. We did $190 million. We talked about $150 million, that's last quarter, so $340 million is the total number we purchased during the quarter.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. As you probably know, during these blackout periods, we have to set a formula and buy under a 10b5 plan. So, once we kind of launch it, our ability to modify it is limited.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Almost zero.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","As a matter of fact, it's exactly zero.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, but if your average price in the quarter was $224 and the stock was below that early in 3Q, I mean, I'm assuming you might have bought more if the terms weren't changed, but I guess we can wait.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We can't change it.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We're locked into, we need to put a little baskets and ranges and so we have to execute to that. So, we don't have the hindsight to be able to select (01:06:05).","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, right. Okay. Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Hey, guys.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hi, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So, Nick or Kevin, back to David's question on the bookings, book-to-bill was, I think, over 1.1 last quarter, 1.08 this quarter in the aftermarket. How big a piece of the business did those book-to-bill numbers represent that we haven't seen anything like that translate through here?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I guess, I'm not sure of your question, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Well, I mean, if your bookings are up, like 10%, but your aftermarket's up low, low-single digits, are those bookings just a small piece of the aftermarket?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I mean...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Are we going to have 10% growth \u2013 what's that?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we've told you what we think the growth is for the year and you can pretty well back into that. Rob, you could take it \u2013 what is it year-to-date? 1-ish or something like that?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Aftermarket volume.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. 1-ish, we've given you a forecast for the year, so you can pretty well figure out what the second half is.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","But, Nick, if you have a quarter like this one, where your book-to-bill is 1.085, right, there should be a future quarter with 8.5% growth if those bookings represent a full quarter of aftermarket.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, obviously, what we book, we will ship. I mean, what makes us feel comfortable about the second half of the year is that the bookings are coming in higher and the distributors are selling through.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So, I mean, I know what you've said for the year, but it would seem that these robust bookings in the first two quarters should do better than that for the second half.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I hope they do, but I mean, the number we're giving you as guidance is mid-single digits. And you do the math. Now, also...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Well, you're right, you're up 1% so far.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But let me finish, Rob. Rob, the book-to-ship, the denominator's not the same. The book-to-ship against the first half, you're rising. So, the relationship between the two isn't the same.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay, but, I guess, what you're telling us is we're going to see something around 10% in the second half.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I guess, I'm exactly \u2013 I mean, you can figure out exactly what I'm telling you, right? I mean, you can take \u2013 you could take where we are year-to-date and you could take 5% for the year or, say, mid-single digits or something like that, you can average it up and you figure out exactly.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Except you're not fully booked for the...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right. You're not fully booked. There's some risk to it.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. I just want to get an idea of how comfortable you are. And while we're on that, for question two, what would you say the biggest risk in the guidance is and where is the greatest conservatism?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Rob, I don't want to give \u2013 we put these in and we make our best judgment on the number. I mean, I can give you \u2013 I think there's very little risk in the commercial OEM business and I think there's very little risk in the defense OEM business, just because those platforms are \u2013 somebody, I guess, could do some inventory restocking, but I think we probably would have seen that by now. The risk is where it always is. The risk is in the aftermarket. That's the shorter cycle stuff and it's the higher-margin stuff.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. I'm just trying to reconcile the guidance to what you saw in the first half and the fact that you're not fully booked and just understand the confidence level on all that.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think the way you might think about it is if you use \u2013 right, if you're up 1% for the first \u2013 and this doesn't \u2013 math doesn't work exactly, Rob, because the denominators aren't the same. But if you're up 1% or 1.5% for the first half of the year and you're booking at 8.5%, if you assumed 8.5% was the second half of the year and you added the two up and divide by two, you'd be...","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Mid-single digits.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...kind of mid single-digits.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","If you add to that \u2013 but I also realize, Rob, as I say again, the denominators aren't exactly the same, because they're rising, but that sort of give you a general sense and I think when you add that to the fact that we go out and we look at our distributors picking up, it makes us feel better. Now, can I tell you that's what it's going to look like in July, how the (01:11:03) distributorship grew? Of course, I can't. But as we sit here today, look at those two \u2013 those kind of couple of facts, it makes us feel like this is a reasonable number.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. All right. Well, thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You're welcome, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael S. Rednor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. This is actually Mike Rednor on for Seth. So, my question is around the defense and kind of the growth that's going on there. What changed kind of in your outlook to drive sales higher? And was it one specific thing or can you offer some color around just the defense business? Thanks.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Kevin, you want to take that (01:11:54)?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, sure. We've seen an increase in requests for quote activity across the ranch. Not all of it has translated into orders yet. I think there's pent-up demand possibly. So, we're seeing strong inquiries across the business, some strength in defense aftermarket and a nice rebound in OEM, some of which was the large program I talked about. But even without that, we would have seen defense OEM orders pick up. Does that answer your question?","Michael S. Rednor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","(01:12:33) can't point to discrete platforms. It's kind of across the board, except for the one large defense OEM booking that I called out. That tends to be across the ranch.","Michael S. Rednor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey guys good morning. This is Bill Ledley on for Gautam. Had a quick question about second sourcing initiatives. Boeing is talking a lot about their own proprietary parts business, especially in the actuation side. Have you seen any increased encouragement second sourcing on the OEM side or the aftermarket?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You mean, on \u2013 the things that we have seen them do have been for items where they own the IP. Essentially, they've been giving the work out on a make-to-print basis. That is, there's very little of our business that is subject to that. Vast majority is our own IP and we have not seen any intrusion into that.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then, could you just remind us when your partner for success agreement ends and when you have to start negotiating for the next round?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It ends in 2019. It ends in 2019 \u2013 2018, end of 2018, excuse me, end of 2018. And I suspect fairly soon, we will.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And just one last quick one, when did the comps in biz jet and helo start to flatten out?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the answer to that. You mean if we looked at our quarterly OEM shipments?","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. I think you called out some green shoots of life in that business in terms of orders in the quarter. Just kind of wondering when the revenue starts to kind of pick up on a year-over-year basis.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think we gave you our forecast for the year and we gave it to you in the segments. I'm not going to break it down. I don't want to break it down any finer than that.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Well, thanks so much.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I would say it's hard. Yes, we saw some decent booking numbers for business jets for the quarter or the first half, but if you also \u2013 if you look at all the noise around the business jet and the forecast production rates, it's hard to get too excited about that.","Bill Ledley - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you so much.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Lipke with Stephens. Your line is open.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the time.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","You just underwent this commercial aftermarket study and I'm curious, you mentioned the commercial aftermarket mix. If you look at the \u2013 just isolating commercial aftermarket and large transport there, I'm curious what platforms currently generate the most revenue for you in that segment right now?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We are almost market-weighted. Matter of fact, we are just about market-weighted. So, I mean, you could go through and figure it out yourself. I mean, what I, frankly, haven't done it, but we generally track, I mean, probably seat miles by platform or something like that is going to be our distribution. We're more pretty much market-weighted.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And on the better defense outlook, I'm curious with \u2013 how quickly should we see an increase in defense aftermarket with \u2013 the spare parts focused and spare parts funding focused and addressing those critical readiness needs?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's tough. I mean, the truth is, I don't know. The speed \u2013 when the government releases money, when it bubbles down to us is awful hard to predict. As Kevin said, we are starting to see some modest pickup, but I mean, I can't tell you whether that will spike up or flatten out. I mean, we feel reasonably good about it from the balance of this year.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Noah?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, can you hear me?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. Noah, I think this is quite disciplined, to ask two questions and get back in the line, I'm impressed.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Some would dispute if my first round was two, but it was \u2013 it was As and Bs under one and two.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I see, I see, we are keeping the track now.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. So, the aftermarket bookings ahead of shipments, it's 8.5% in the first half?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I believe that was 12% in the first quarter. So, is it 12% in the first quarter and 5% in the second quarter?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's less. It's less.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'm not looking at the number, but it averages 8.5%.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And so, is the reason that the 12% doesn't immediately flow through to a similar revenue growth rate that, that 12% is comparing to 1Q revenue in the denominator.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Whereas 2Q revenue growth is the year ago, which was a higher absolute revenue?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. The denominators aren't the same.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right. So, 12% over the lowest Q1 doesn't reflect the 12% growth in Q2, you know what I'm saying.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. I got it. And what is that number...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think the best way to look at that, Noah, is at least the way I look at it is, it's not mathematically perfect, but if you're bringing in work at 8.5% higher than you're shipping it out, that's a reasonably positive indicator.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. What is that number on a trailing 12-month basis? Do you know?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the number. It's probably \u2013 I don't know it's a public number or not, but I don't know the number.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, I don't know if you guys give it quite every quarter. And what is the sort of time it takes to extinguish bookings in that business?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You mean \u2013 yeah, yeah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Like, when does it all convert?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. It's not consistent by \u2013 across our businesses, but it's surely less than six months on average.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Less than six months, okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I would guess, Noah, and I'm giving you a rough estimate, I don't know this number now, but I would guess, it's three to four months backlog.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So, some in the first quarter, some in the quarter after that, maybe a little bit.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right. I mean, again, what makes us feel positive is that \u2013 (01:19:40) feel some confidence in the second half is we see the bookings running ahead. And even though a lot of our business doesn't go through distributors, that's our best look. That's another good look. And we see that pick up and that gives us a positive deal.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, that makes sense. And then, just last one. Did you guys quantify defense aftermarket growth in the quarter and also there the bookings versus revenue?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. We just give a total number for defense.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Do you have that aftermarket breakout?","(01:20:16)","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I would tell you, I didn't give you the growth rate, because I don't know it, but the \u2013 basically, the aftermarket split versus OEM is about the same in defense as it is in the overall business.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","A little over half aftermarket.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. Okay. So, it doesn't sound like the growth rate in the \u2013 doesn't sound like that's been \u2013 like the aftermarket has been growing much faster than OE there and necessarily. Just curious of the shorter-cycle piece of that business.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, no. For the year, the OE has been growing faster than the aftermarket.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In defense?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","In defense, in total, for the six-month period. And that's somewhat influenced by some quite a big order in the second quarter.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's right. This is Kevin.","(01:21:16)","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Oh, hold it, hold it, never mind, Noah, I'm looking at the bookings.","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, you're right. You're right, year-to-date, the aftermarket's up, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Can you precisely quantify it if you're looking right at it?","Kevin M. Stein - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, I can't precisely quantify it. I don't know how to figure it out.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's fair enough. I got it directionally then. Thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But the bookings are going \u2013 I gave you the bookings. I told you the bookings are the other way.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, by the way, just to be clear, the aftermarket is up. It's not \u2013 for the bookings, it's not declining, it's just the OEMs jumping faster.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. So, I was disciplined too, so I get one more.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Here's another disciplined soul.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The distributor commentary you had on look-through sales, I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying. Are you saying that the distributors selling your products were up double-digit in terms of the sales that they're seeing and you were down 1.5%?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes. We are saying that the \u2013 if you compare our dollars sold and primarily we look at that, there may be all (01:22:41), because that's where we get the best information. The odds and ends are little wounds, but they're just as good (01:22:45), but they're quite good, the data. What we're saying is, if you take the Q2 sales, for this Q2 against Q2 of the previous year, they're up significantly and up well above the price increase.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Were your sales into the distributors different? You said it's down 1.5% on an organic basis. Was there a big difference between what your sales in the distribution was year-on-year versus your sales on a non-distribution year-on-year?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know the answer to that. I don't know the answer to that.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then...","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I just had one number for commercial aftermarket. I don't know the...","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay, I just wanted to know the definition of look-through, because it would, obviously, imply that they might liquidate their inventory.","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, well, anyway, I don't know the answer. I know where you're going.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then the other one on the denominator, how much of your aftermarket sales are first half versus second half historically in terms of weighting? Is it proportional to sales, the overall company sales; is that best way to guess?","W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's probably a decent estimate.

My name is Regina, and I'll be your conference operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's event is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Liza Sabol","Good morning, and welcome to TransDigm Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Ray Laubenthal; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus.","The company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC. These filings are available through the Investor section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically, EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","Let me now turn the call over to Nick.","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, good morning, and thanks again for calling in to hear about our company. Today, I'll start off with some comments about our consistent strategy, then an update on the commercial aftermarket and also on the Boeing Partnering for Success program. I'll then give an overview of the financial performance and market summary for -- in Q1 2014 and an update on the full year guidance.","Just to restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and around 3\/4 of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Excluding the small non-aviation business, about 54% of our revenue and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and provided relative stability in the aerospace cycles.","Based on our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditure requirements, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated strong free cash flow. We have a well-proven value-based operating strategy focused around what we refer to as our 3 value drivers: new business development, continual cost improvement and value-based pricing. We also maintain a decentralized organization structure with operating unit executives who think, act and are paid like owners. We stick to these concepts as the core of our operating management methods. This consistent approach has worked for us through up and down markets while allowing us to steadily invest in new businesses and new platform positions.","We have also been successful in regularly acquiring and integrating businesses. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have been able to acquire and improve such businesses through all phases of the cycle. We pay close attention to our capital structure and view it as another means to create shareholder value. As you know, we have been in the past and continue to be willing to lever up when we either see good opportunities or view our leverage as suboptimum for value creation. We typically begin to delever pretty quickly.","With respect to capital allocation, we will look closely through the year in our choices for capital allocation. We basically have 4. Our priorities are typically as follows: one, invest in existing businesses; two, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy; these 2 are always our first choices; third, pay off debt. But given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is likely our last choice in the current market condition; and fourth, give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through special dividends or stock buyback.","As the year proceeds, we will look at our likely needs for acquisition and internal investment, our cash and\/or debt capacity, as well as the capital market situations, all in context of our near and midterm outlook. At this time, we are not prepared to speculate on what, if any, major actions we might take. We'll see what conditions exist as the year proceeds. At the end of Q1, after closing the Airborne acquisition, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make about $1.5 billion of acquisitions without needing additional equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for 2014.","Overall, through our consistent focus on our operating value drivers, a clear acquisition strategy and close attention to our capital structure and allocation, we have been able to create intrinsic value for our shareholders for many years through up and down markets, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future.","Now to address a few specific items that have to do with this first quarter. As you know, on December 19, we closed on the acquisition of Airborne Systems for about $250 million. We bought this from Metalmark Capital. Airborne is the world leader in the design and manufacture of military personnel parachutes, cargo aerial delivery systems and related products. The company's proprietary products have significant, often sole-sourced positions with the government of the United States, United Kingdom and about 50 additional nations. The primary product offerings include current generation troop parachutes, latest generation steerable parachutes for tight drop zone landings, ram-air, maneuverable parachutes used for special operation activities and precision-guided cargo chutes that are used for high-altitude GPS-driven cargo drops.","Airborne's a unique company and asset in the industry with most of its revenue from proprietary and sole-source sales, the company fits well with our criteria and value-creation model. The large number of international customers generate a majority of the company's revenues. The international content is growing and provides a buffer to the current uncertainties of the U.S. defense spending environment. I do not anticipate that this is a business that gets to the PV average EBITDA margin, but I believe it will generate significant shareholder value.","Now with respect to the aftermarket status. To reiterate, again, in the second half of fiscal year 2013, we began to see signs of a recovery. We believe the trend was roughly up about 4.5% year-over-year for the second half of 2013. This was after adjusting for certain items we discussed in prior calls. The first quarter of fiscal year 2014 commercial aftermarket revenues on a same-store basis were up about 7.5% versus the prior year Q1. Sequentially, the revenues were up about 6%, in spite of less working days.","Additionally, the bookings were up about 14% versus the prior Q1 and up about the same percent sequentially. It's too soon to declare victory, but we surely feel more positive. The recovery may not be linear. There may well be ups and downs in the quarters. Many forecasters, however, believe that our data now seems to suggest more strongly that the commercial aftermarket is now expanding. Time will, of course, tell on [ph] here.","I'd also like to comment on the Boeing Partnering for Success program. Though we have a mutual confidentiality agreement, and as I've said in the past, as a general rule, we don't share details of customer negotiations. I can make a few general statements. In January, Boeing and TransDigm reached agreement on the Partnering for Success program, and both signed a memorandum of understanding. We believe this agreement is mutually beneficial to Boeing and TransDigm. As part of this agreement, TransDigm continues and maintains its long-standing position as a valued long-term supplier in good standing for future and existing Boeing airframes. We do not expect this will have any material impact on our financial performance as a result of this agreement. We are pleased to have this concluded and look forward to continuing our large -- our long and mutually beneficial relationship with Boeing. Due to our confidentiality agreement, this will be my only comment on that subject.","Turning to our Q1 2014 performance. To remind you, this is the first quarter of our year. Our year began October 1. As I've said frequently, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by mix, large orders, inventory fluctuations, little seasonality and other things. Also, to remind everyone, Airborne is not included in these numbers. We owned it for 10 working days, most of which were a holiday break period.","The first quarter of fiscal year '14 was generally a good quarter for TransDigm. Revenue, profits and margins were all strong. GAAP revenue was up 23% versus the prior Q1. Pro forma revenue, that is if we owned the same mix of businesses, was up about 9% on the quarter versus prior year quarter.","Reviewing revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus the prior Q1, that is assuming we own the same mix. The commercial aftermarket -- or the commercial market, which makes up about 3\/4 of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up 10.5% versus the prior Q1. This is driven by commercial transport OEM revenues, which were up a bit more than that, and the business jet revenues were about flat. Total commercial aftermarket revenue comps, as I said before, were up about 7.5% versus the prior Q1. Our individual operating units continue to be a little spotty, but most units are up this quarter.","The defense market makes up about 1\/4 of our revenue. Defense revenues are up in the mid-single digit percent versus a very low prior year first quarter -- excuse me, mid-double digits versus a very low prior year first quarter. More significantly, revenues were about 5% up versus the prior year 12-month run rate. There were about $7 million of Tarian shipments almost completing the order. But even without that, removing it from both periods, the percent revenue in Q1 was still up a bit versus the prior year's average run rate.","Incoming defense orders or bookings ran slightly ahead of shipments. Ray's going to give you a little more color on this. We are pleased with the military results so far. We hope that the recent budget agreement will provide some stability, but we remain cautious about trends in these markets.","Moving on now to profitability. And on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. The as-defined adjustments of Q1 were primarily due to acquisition-related costs and noncash stock option expense. Our EBITDA as defined of about $244 million for Q1 was up 21% versus prior Q1. The EBITDA as defined margin was 46% of revenue for Q1. Our base business EBITDA, that is excluding the 3 acquisitions we made in 2013, was about 48%. That's up about one percentage point versus the prior year's Q1 with a very comparable market mix of products.","With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is pretty active, about the same mix of sizes as usual. Probably the commercial versus defense mix is a little more normal now. Closings are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Moving on now to 2014 guidance, and I think this is on Slide 6 of the package we gave out. Once again, military spending is unclear. But so far, so good. The rate of recovery in the commercial aftermarket seems to be proceeding, and the EBITDA margins are running slightly ahead. We are reflecting the Airborne acquisition in this revision. This is our best current estimate. As usual, we'll let you know if our views change one way or the other.","Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions, 2014 revised guidance is as follows: The midpoint of the revised guidance is now $2.3 billion versus our prior guidance of a little under $2.2 billion. This is up about 6% on a GAAP basis versus the prior guidance. The revenue increase is due to the Airborne acquisition.","The midpoint of the 2014 revised EBITDA as defined guidance is $1.05 billion or about 45.5% of revenue for the year. It's up $32 million versus the prior guidance. This margin includes 1.5% of dilution from Airborne, which will begin to show in Q2. This is offset partially by some operational improvements that we saw in Q1. The dollar increase of EBITDA is about 3\/4 from the 9 months of Airborne acquisition that we owned it and about 1\/4 from improved base margins.","The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $7.50 a share versus the prior guidance of $7.16. This is primarily due to the same items impacting the EBITDA as defined. At this time, our 2014 guidance is still based on the same market growth rate assumptions we gave with our original guidance. We're not yet comfortable enough to increase our full year assumptions. We'll look at this again next quarter.","In summary, Q1 was a good start. Hopefully, the strengthening market conditions will continue. But in any event, I'm confident with our consistent, value-focused strategy and strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors.","Now let me hand this over to Ray, who will discuss some of the high points and operating issues from Q1.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Thanks, Nick. As Nick mentioned, in total, our first quarter was better than our expectations. However, we continue to tightly manage our cost structure and work our value drivers to create shareholder value. Let me explain our 2014 first quarter operational value creation a little bit more detail.","Right before their holiday shutdown, we completed the acquisition of Airborne Systems Incorporated. The value-creation transition of this business has started, and we are presently working through various productivity projects and structuring the business into our product lines with their associated value-creation metrics.","The 3 businesses we acquired last summer are also progressing well. At Arkwin, we have completed the first stage of our productivity restructuring, organized the business into product lines, focused the engineering and installed a proven Sales and Marketing Director and a Controller, who both had come from our existing operations. The Arkwin margins are moving up nicely, and we expect them to eventually reach the average TransDigm EBITDA margins.","At our Whippany Actuation business, the transition activity has been more complex as we work through the systematic decoupling from GE. However, progress today is at or above expectations. As with Arkwin, we have completed the first phase of productivity restructuring, organized the teams and the product lines, focused the engineering and installed our value-creation metrics.","To expedite the value creation and integration process, we added some proven TransDigm managers to the acquisition. Shortly after we acquired Whippany Actuation, we appointed Jack Stiffler as the President. Jack previously was the President of our MarathonNorco unit. Jack then immediately installed a new Director of Sales and Marketing who also came from one of our existing units.","The Whippany margins are also moving up, albeit at a slower rate due to their existing contracts, the nature of some of their government business and the drawdown of certain distribution inventory. We don't expect their margins to get as high as the TransDigm average. However, we do expect them to meet or exceed our acquisition model.","Lastly, our Aerosonic transition -- acquisition transition is also on track with similar progress as discussed with Arkwin and Whippany Actuation. In addition to the productivity improvements and product line work, we appointed Joe Grote as President. Joe previously was the President of our CDA unit. Joe also drew on existing TransDigm talent and installed [ph] an Internal Manager as one of the new product line managers at Aerosonic. Aerosonic's margins are also expanding.","Our internal talent development continues to serve us well. The salting of TransDigm talent into these recent acquisitions generally augments their value-creation transition. In fact, the vacancies created by moving the new presidents and managers into these acquisitions were also backfilled by internal talent, TransDigm talent. As I have said in the past, we believe our succession planning and value-creation culture are key to growing TransDigm value.","As Nick mentioned, our defense segment continues to outperform our expectations. I'd like to give this a little color. Last quarter, we stated that our fiscal 2013 defense market revenues were up a healthy 7% over fiscal 2012 revenues and that our defense market growth expectations for 2014 were flat coming off of these rather strong 2013 results. Our last 2 quarters of defense bookings have continued to be better than expected. Typically, defense bookings precede revenue by about 3 to 9 months, so this strong order rate gives us a good near-term backlog. We have upside in this segment for our first half. If this strength continues, we may also have upside in our defense revenues in all of 2014.","The strength in the recent 6 months defense segment has been more aftermarket than OEM. Generally, the uptick in OEM has been for our new products and applications on the A400M and the F-35 or the JSF. The significant aftermarket strength has been predominantly from our products on the active fleet of fighters: the F-15, F-16, the F-18, the F-4 and the A-10 attack aircraft, and also cargo aircraft, the C-130 and the C-17. We'll see how this continues as the year progresses. But so far, so good.","Now let me hand it over to Greg Rufus, our CFO, who will review the first quarter financial results in more detail.","Gregory Rufus","Thanks, Ray. As disclosed in this morning's press release and just discussed by Nick, our first quarter sales were $529 million and 23% greater than the prior year. Our organic sales were 9% higher than last year, and the growth in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense were all positive.","Our first quarter gross margin was $284 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year. The reported gross profit margin of 53.7% was 1.7 margin points less than the prior year. The dilutive operational impact from acquisitions was a little over 2 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved approximately 0.5 margin point.","Selling and administrative expenses were 10.8% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12.8% for the prior year. The 2 percentage point decrease was primarily due to lower SG&A spending as a percent of sales relative to our sales growth and lower noncash stock comp expense versus the prior year Q1. If you recall, we accelerated this expense in quarter 3 last year, which had the impact of lowering this year's expense.","Interest expense was $81 million, an increase of approximately $18 million versus the prior year quarter. This is a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $5.7 billion in the current quarter versus $4.2 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the amount borrowed to distribute $1.8 billion of special dividends last year. Our weighted average cash interest rate has decreased to 5.4% compared to 5.6% in the prior year due to the lower interest rates on the new debt.","Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in the current quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior year. We still expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be around 34% and our cash taxes to be about -- approximately $190 million.","Our net income for the quarter increased $12 million or 16% to $86 million, which is 16% of sales. This compares to net income of $74 million in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the growth in net sales, partially offset by higher interest expense.","As I've discussed in the past, our earnings per share is calculated under the 2-class method versus the more commonly used treasury method. We are required to use this method because of our dividend equivalent program. As you can see on Tables 1 and 3 in this morning's press release, our GAAP EPS was $1.44 per share in the current quarter compared to just $0.66 per share last year. The prior year quarter was significantly impacted by the dividend equivalent payment of $38 million or $0.70 per share compared to the $0.07 per share this period. The higher dividend equivalent payment was associated with the $700 million or $12.85 per share dividend paid in November of fiscal '13.","Our adjusted EPS was $1.66 per share, an increase of 10% compared to $1.51 per share last year. The 10% increase is lower than our 16% increase of adjusted net income due to the higher weighted average shares in the current period, resulting from the accelerated stock option vesting mentioned earlier. Again, please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP and adjusted EPS.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity. After the purchase of Airborne, we ended the quarter with $411 million of cash on the balance sheet. The company's net debt leverage ratio was 5.4x our pro forma EBITDA as defined. We now expect to end the year with approximately $750 million of cash on the balance sheet assuming no other acquisition activity or changes in our capital structure. We expect our net debt leverage ratio to be approximately 4.7x EBITDA as defined at the end of our fiscal year.","Now let me hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question today comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Nick, on M&A and the M&A pipeline, you provided some comments on sort of what you could do right now given where the balance sheet is, but you didn't really talk about the health of the pipeline as you see it today, which you normally do. Is that something you're willing to share with us right now?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. No, I thought I -- you may find it unfulfilling, but I thought I said about the same thing I always did, that our pipeline is pretty active, where we remain working with -- I think I've said that there's a little more normal than we normal -- than we have been seeing in the commercial trends mix. The sizes and the stock are about what we usually see.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When we see Airborne, which is essentially all military, should there be any part of us that interprets that to mean it's now proving more difficult to find reasonably priced aerospace, primarily commercial assets, that have the characteristics you're looking for, or is this more specific to what you saw in Airborne?","W. Nicholas Howley","It's more specific what we saw in Airborne. We are not -- as we've always said, we're looking for proprietary aerospace kind of products with a reasonable amount of aftermarket. And if they meet our sort of P\/E kind of return, we're an interested buyer. We're not biased necessarily against defense, though I must say I don't -- I wouldn't want to move this -- we wouldn't want this to be a 50-50 defense business. But if the price is right and it has the right characteristics, we're interested in it. All things being equal, we'd probably pick a commercial business. But you deal with them as they come up, and this looks like a good, accretive transaction to us.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So it doesn't sound like you're really finding it more difficult in any meaningful way to find good, reasonably priced, primarily, aerospace assets compared to 12 months ago or 18 months ago or any time.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, I don't think so. You can always argue what reasonably priced means. But I would say, the prices haven't changed substantively as best I can tell. The hardest issue is always finding things that meet our -- our criteria is pretty tight. We want it to be proprietary. We want to double [ph] our sole-source stuff. That's always the issue is this sorting through them to get the ones that really meet our criteria.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the base defense business where you commented that the shrink there is aftermarket, not original equipment. And I think you mentioned within that, it's fighter and cargo. Is it possible, even if rough order of magnitude, to quantify how much of your defense aftermarket business is fighter versus cargo versus helicopter? Because we've seen a number of other companies have pretty significant weakness in their defense aftermarket business, attributing it to helicopter. We've heard investors speculate that they would think that's something that would eventually impact TransDigm. It doesn't sound like that's happening, at least, yet. So if we could understand that mix a little better, I think that would be helpful.","Raymond F. Laubenthal","Okay. Noah, this is Ray. Well, first off, the government ordering patterns and so forth, and we've said this in the past, can be quite lumpy. So it's tough to take a comparison from one period to the next and start drawing general conclusions. We just happen to see that the aftermarket was a little stronger than the OEM. That doesn't mean the OEM was way down. We're kind of spread about 1\/3-1\/3-1\/3 on our platforms, about 1\/3 of our applications are on the helicopters, about 1\/3 in the kind of fixed lean fighter area and about 1\/3 in the cargo aircraft. Helicopters were strong for us in prior years, a little bit more so, not like they were as strong in the most recent period. We don't think that's any big trend, but that's just how they kind of were lumpy this time around.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So the first one I have for you -- I guess -- so just maybe to follow up on the military question for a second. Was there a big difference in domestic versus international in terms of the strength of growth? I know that there was a larger international booking you had last year. I don't know if that's helping in some of the near-term sales numbers.","W. Nicholas Howley","That one is -- I think as I've said, Myles, in the lead-in, that, that was about $7 million in the quarter, would consist about the same as it was in the fourth quarter of last year. That order is almost finished. I want to say it was a $17 million or $18 million order and that we shipped about $15 million of it. But even if you strip that out of both periods, the run rate from this first quarter was higher than the average run rate for last year. And I talk about the average run rate because the first quarter was very low last year. So that's a meaningful comp, at least for us. We sort of look at the average run rate just because -- otherwise the increases is a little distorted. But clearly better than we hoped, than we thought it may be, and we feel decent about the next quarter.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Good. And then, Greg, on the SG&A leverage, keeping in control on the cost growth lower than the sales growth, do you have a kind of thought on the target range for SG&A as a percent of sales or how much more leverage you can get out of constrained cost there?","Gregory Rufus","Well, this quarter is a good quarter. We're still planning on our total SG&A for the year to be about 11.5%.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And that's inclusive of the -- that's not an adjusted basis. That's inclusive of the comp?","Gregory Rufus","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Nick, you talked about the lower margins at Airborne. And maybe I got to factor in more when I look at incremental in the guidance, between the added sales and the added EBIT -- EBITDA as defined, but it -- I think by my math, it's about a 25% EBITDA as defined margin for the contribution of Airborne this year. And that would seem to be a bit of a departure. Is this a one-off? Is it the nature of this military business and the parachute business, or is -- might we see some more deals at lower margins?","W. Nicholas Howley","So you'll do the math.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I used the midpoint, and I know there might be other puts and takes in there.","W. Nicholas Howley","You're not miles off. And I'll give you the pieces, right, so you could figure it out. The -- well, it's not unusual that we bring businesses in substantially below our average. I mean, bringing the businesses in 25% EBITDA is not unusual at all for us. I would expect that's more the rule than the exception, have a business come in like that. However, I will say the nature of this business is such it's not going to pipe [ph] this long [ph] . Who knows where the future could bring, but I think it's unlikely this business gets up to 50% EBITDA.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess maybe the way to ask you this, is this the before or is this the after margin or something in the middle?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, I hope to hell it's the before. I'll be very sad if it comes down from here, Rob.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, yes. We all hope not. On -- I don't want to ask you specifically about -- any more about the deal you did with Boeing, because you said you won't talk about it. But one thing I think we're struggling for is, just abstractly, in these deals, everybody says it's a win-win for everybody. But the presumption is that somebody has to give a little more than the other. Can you just talk, from an abstract perspective, of how the horse-trading works on these things?","W. Nicholas Howley","Rob, I just can't. We have -- this is a -- it's very sensitive to Boeing, and somewhat to us, that we maintain a confidentiality agreement with how this -- and we -- we were very clear with them what we would and wouldn't say. And I really just can't go beyond it, other than to say, as we said, this is not going to have a -- we don't see this having a material impact on our financial statements or our performance. And obviously, we thought it was worthwhile deal to make or we wouldn't make it.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. You were clear you weren't going to go there, so I just wanted to try.","W. Nicholas Howley","Maybe if you ask it weekly, I might miss the question.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's good wreck [ph] . I'll remember that next time. On -- I'll try this one. On the aftermarket, we've gotten some sense that aircraft, that used aircraft are being extended a little bit more than before. Aircraft coming off-lease are being re-leased, maybe having a little bit easier time getting remarketed than even 6 months ago. Does this explain any of the strength you're seeing? Do you get a sense in talking to your customers that the mix of the fleet is not shifting quite as quickly to new as we thought, not because the new aircraft aren't delivering, but because the old ones aren't retiring as quickly?","W. Nicholas Howley","Rob, I also heard that anecdotally. But I honestly can't tell you that I can give you any good numbers or I have any numbers to give me any particular comfort in that. But I have heard that anecdotally also.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just following up on that question on the aftermarket. Off of the levels that you saw in Q1, what kind of sequential growth do you need to kind of hit your high single-digit target for the year?","W. Nicholas Howley","We didn't really give quarterly guidance. So we didn't...","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. I'm just talking maybe if you take Q4, what...","W. Nicholas Howley","We haven't given that, Myles, by quarter, and I don't want to speculate on it now. But you could figure it out pretty well, right?","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. I'm not -- that's the reason I asked, because it doesn't seem to apply much in the way of any sort of sequential growth or not much sequential growth.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. So we have to get there. If we said, 8% to 9% for the year, right, we'd have to -- if everything was linear, if you get 7.5% in the first quarter, we need to get whatever that comes to -- in the 10.5% in the fourth quarter.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. But I'm just talking kind of sequential off the run rate where you are today.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. We haven't given that, and we prefer to stay away. We don't care to give quarterly guidance on it. We did tell you -- we did give you some data on the bookings.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, yes. I think Ray mentioned that -- or maybe it's Greg about the increase in guidance on the EBITDA side. There's about 25% of it from the base operations. Is that some of the upside? I assume it's not upside on some of the recent acquisitions. Where exactly is that coming from?","W. Nicholas Howley","It's just the -- it's the underlying business, however you want to define it. We bumped up -- I want to say $32 million is not the number [indiscernible] , $32 million. We wanted to give you some sense how much of that was Airborne and how much was -- the margins were a little -- I feel a little better about the margins.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I'll try another one on this Partnering for Success. Yes, I'll give it a shot. I mean, is it -- the agreement that you were able to reach with Boeing, does it change anything fundamentally about your business model in terms of the kind of upside you can get from the aftermarket once you're spec-ed into an aircraft. Thinking about new aircraft that are still to come and your position on that, does it change anything from that -- in that...","W. Nicholas Howley","I just don't want to -- as I've said, we -- I do not see a material impact on our business. And so -- and we just -- we have a -- I'm just going to repeat myself now. We've been pretty clear with Boeing and Boeing with us that we'll say what we agreed to say and no more.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, last one. Greg, what is the D&A assumption for the year? Does the amortization step down as we go through the year?","Gregory Rufus","Well, boy, not with Airborne now, right? And, well, we haven't gone -- hold on. Our prior guidance -- where are we at? Is this your D&A and depreciation? Okay. D&A and amortization goes up about $6 million, and backlog was up about $6 million.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Off the prior guidance?","Gregory Rufus","Off the prior guidance.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Nick, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned sort of buybacks is one of the options. Of course, you haven't really used that in the past. I'm just curious, has the thinking evolved at all on buybacks versus special dividends?","W. Nicholas Howley","I don't -- I think it is mostly, so far with us, been a question of magnitude. We have -- the magnitude of the givebacks to the shareholders have been very big. I know it -- the first thing was 20% of the share value. The ones we did last year were about 25%. Our thinking on those has been with such big numbers, we'd be better off to give the dividend and get it over with for surety of execution and the like. If the numbers were smaller, it wouldn't be so clear to us what made sense. I mean, we're not opposed to a buyback. It's just is a -- it's a very fact- and circumstance-specific thing.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And if I could ask a question about aftermarket. Certainly, the recent trends have been strong but the guidance for the full year looks good. But I was hoping that you could offer maybe some bigger-picture sort of commentary around it. As you read the tea leaves for different product lines, what you're hearing from customers and maybe your own top-down view, I mean, what can you tell us about the sustainability of this inflection in aftermarket that we're seeing? Does this have legs?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, as I told you, it feels to us, and our data seems to indicate and everybody else seems to indicate, that this market is now expanding and rising. We think it is. Now I would say, as I've said, a lot of times, these things aren't linear. They don't always go up in a straight line, and there could be bumps along the road. But it feels to us like this is a rising market that's got 2 legs to it.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just last one on Partnering for Success, but just a clarification. I'm assuming your best estimate of that agreement is in the 2014 updated guidance. Is that true?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes.","Operator","Is from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Nick, just a couple of quick ones on the aftermarket. First, I was wondering if you could tell us if aftermarket volumes are actually up in the quarter.","W. Nicholas Howley","Up against what? Up against the -- or you mean to strip the price out?","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, if you stripped out the price. I think in prior quarters, you've said that -- you've talked about -- you haven't given us a number, but you said if it's up and down.","W. Nicholas Howley","You mean what is it in unit sales because -- Rob, is that what you're after?","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actual units. That's a good way of putting it.","W. Nicholas Howley","You mean if you stripped out the price. Yes, they're absolutely up. It's up. That rise is greater than the average price increase.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a second one. Last quarter, you talked about this whole issue of normalized growth, then some issues in the distribution chain. Has that all sorted itself out now?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. It is not a material impact or significant impact on this quarter. It's -- when we look down, there's kind of puts and takes where it was kind of all in one direction. Some of the other quarters now, whatever movement there is sort of all cancel each other out. So it looks to us like a pretty clean number.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And then just finally on your OEM guidance for the year. It's obviously a bit down from where you did in the first quarter. How do you think this is going to play out, because I'd imagine you have pretty good visibility on wherever Boeing and biz jet guys, want to take their volumes over the next 12 months.","W. Nicholas Howley","I don't -- what did we say? It was 10.5% in the first quarter. It's going to add to roughly our -- what's our year? The same? Yes. So I wouldn't draw anything from that, other than it's just timing on when some things happen to ship. But if it looks like it -- if it start to look like it's a likely annual change, we'll update it next quarter. But we don't know anything other than some timing. I don't know anything about their shipment or production rates or inventory swings that would make me change something right now in the OEM world.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So first question on the guidance. Based on the first quarter, it seems like you might have even raised it little bit more. I was just wondering to what extent that some of the macroeconomic perturbations here in the last week or 2 maybe stage [ph] your hand a bit. And if not for that, would have guidance been a bit higher perhaps?","W. Nicholas Howley","Possibly. I would say the defense business is better than we expected. And as Ray said, probably the first half of the year is better than we expected. If that continues, that clearly could be an upside. The commercial aftermarket is a good quarter. It's just too soon for us to feel comfortable moving our yearly number up. I don't know if I could attribute that to one thing or another. Just that we don't have enough data yet. On the commercial -- on the OEM business, commercial OEM business, I don't -- I have no basis really at this point to change it, and we think it's all been just timing between the quarters.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And I guess related question. I don't think many of us would've expected that tapering would actually cost interest rates to come down a bit. But assuming that tapering ultimately gets interest rates heading in the opposite direction, to what extent do higher interest rates out in the market impact your capital allocation plans? In other words, if interest rates begin to go up, does that put a little bit more incentive on you guys to maybe pay back some of the debt over time?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, at some point, of course, it does. But I would say, in the range of likely movements in the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months and this is always risky to say that. There [ph] were likely movements in the capital market could be. But in the range of what I think is likely, it probably doesn't change our minds a lot. Our average interest is, Greg, I want to say 5.4%, about 5.4%? It's that -- let's say that average went -- which will be very hard to do if you look at our mix. But let's say it went to 6.5% or 7%, I doubt that changes our decision significantly, particularly when it's after tax money.","Gregory Rufus","And in the short run, by the end of '14, we already have some contracts that will fix the variable. It will be closer to 70% fixed at the end of '14.","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes, yes. As of the end of '14, for the next 4 or 5 years, 75% of the debt's fixed.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes. I was also thinking about the fact that if you know that down the line, you're going to have to refinance that debt at some point, would you want to take some exposure down even if your rates are fixed?","W. Nicholas Howley","I don't -- I would just say I don't want to speculate. We are not working on that right now. We're forever getting people in, giving us pictures on restructuring it. We did a fair amount of restructuring last year. And at least, right now, that's not in our gun sight.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one modeling question. Can you just kind of walk through the bridge between the gap and pro forma EPS this year?","Gregory Rufus","You know what? Rather than bore you to death, I think that's on Page 9, that slide that takes the EPS down and it shows the differences. When you look at our original guidance, dividend equivalent payment stays the same. Noncash stock comp's about the same, a little more. And the acquisition-related costs are up, reflecting Airborne, because there's some severance and reorganizational costs that'll be associated with that acquisition.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Nick, I was wondering on the commercial aftermarket if you might be able to provide a little more color like you did with defense on what types of products or what types of platforms are doing better or worse, or is it really just random and spotty like you said in your comments?","W. Nicholas Howley","Yes. When we say spotty -- I'd say spotty, but mostly up. But everything's not up. The -- I can't tie this to one platform or another. I can say, some of the discretionary things that weren't moving as well in last year started to move this quarter. We'll see whether that's a pattern or not.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just over on Airborne, understanding that we've already talked about the military versus commercial and the margins. But just stepping back, the product type seems very different than almost everything else that you have in your portfolio. I'm just looking at a page in your annual report right now and something you've had on your slides with all the different types of hardware. Most of it is bolted on to something that flies. This is kind of its own -- my understanding is its own kind of self-contained system. So when you think about pricing power and all the things that you guys typically go after, channel to markets, the competitive landscape, how would you characterize -- how do you get comfortable with something that's a little different in that respect?","W. Nicholas Howley","No, we had to get through the -- to try to understand it, as best we could on any, and model it. We think there is our value drivers, which are new product development, cost reduction and pricing opportunity, we think they're sum of all here. The -- and -- the -- we -- so when we go through and do the math, even on a constant multiple, we see our private equity-like return on it, which we -- as I think you know how we do that. We define that as we roughly capitalize something about -- at our average, our long-term average, and assume the rest is equity. So we saw pretty good return, even in a constant multiple. And also, frankly, we are -- we bought it at a pretty good price. So I mean, it has a fair amount of the attributes that we like to see in the business.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you think about your pricing power in the competitive landscape specifically -- I mean, maybe if you could just characterize the competition. Is this something you go out and you're able to raise the price every year?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, that's -- it's different in the different segments. But we see opportunity there or, frankly, we wouldn't have bought it. And I don't want to start speculating on where it might make sense and where it might not. But I would say the opportunities in the domestic market may not be as good as they are in foreign markets. But this is a business that is majority outside the U.S. and growing outside the U.S.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Keybanc.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Nick, maybe just one more on Partnering for Success. Can we assume that any future acquisitions that you guys make are going to be incorporated into this sort of contract or is there any renegotiation that has to happen?","W. Nicholas Howley","Michael, I think I have to say for Partnering Success, I think you've got about all you're going to get.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","All right, fair enough. I figured you'd might. On -- then on the aftermarket, can you sort of -- as you look at the airlines, can you guys point to any sort of are there restocking trends? Are you seeing maybe the average dollars spent on shop visits ticking higher? Can you give us any kind of qualitative color as to maybe what you're seeing from the behavior of the airlines?","W. Nicholas Howley","Well, I can say that if you guys were to look through with the distribution, we were having all kinds of inventory movement around. That seems to have settled down. So as I said, through the puts and takes sort of cancel each other out. We still have the situation with the GE business we acquired that we knew we're going to have to draw down inventory, but that's not material and it's offset by some other things. I can say we saw more activity in the discretionary products, which isn't a big part of our business. But what it is, we saw more activity this quarter than we had in the past, which would lead us to think that people must feel better. As far as average order size, I don't know that I can speak to that with any specificity. Though presumptively, it's a little higher.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then last one. You guys mentioned a couple of times, just the EBITDA margins and you kind of went back and referenced the core TransDigm margins. Should we be thinking about, in aggregate, your EBITDA margins for that target coming down as you continue to make these acquisitions? I mean, Airborne is going to be a part of the business. You guys are acquisitive. I mean, structurally, should we think about your EBITDA margins coming down a couple of hundred basis points?","W. Nicholas Howley","I don't want to -- I really don't want to speculate on that because it's very dependent on what we buy, the rate at which we buy them and the rate at which they can be improved. I mean, generally, if we slow down the acquisitions, when things slow down, the margins start to expand quicker. I think for the full year this year, if you strip out the 3 acquisitions last year and Airborne, I think the rest of the business, we think, will expand about 1.5 margin points. So maybe that gives you some sense.","Operator","You have additional question that is queued up from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wondering if there's any difference by geography you can speak to in the aftermarket, regionally.","W. Nicholas Howley","We're seeing different trends in geographic. I don't know -- truthfully, I don't know enough to -- I don't know the answer to that for these past 90 days. I mean, I could - I would speculate that it's probably more movement in the Pacific Rim than Europe, but I don't know the number.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just any change by channel distribution versus direct MRO?","W. Nicholas Howley","No.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time, so I'll turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks you'd like to make.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, everyone, for calling in this morning, and we plan to file our 10-Q sometime tomorrow.

With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; President and Chief Operating Officer, Ray Laubenthal; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Rufus.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks.

You will need to manually advance them. We apologize for any inconvenience.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas Howley","Good morning and thanks again for calling in to hear about our company. As usual, I\u2019d like to start with some comments about our consistent strategy. I\u2019ll also talk a little bit about the pending acquisition of AmSafe and our current status in the aerospace market, particularly how it applies to TransDigm.","To reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this and this is on Page 4 of the slide, about 90% of more of our net sales are generated by proprietary products, and around three-quarters of our sales come from products for which we are the sole source provider.","About 55% of our revenue and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and provided relative stability in the downtimes. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, typically approaching 50%, and relatively low capital expenditure requirements, about 2% or less of revenue, TransDigm has year in and year out generated strong free cash flow. We pay close attention to our capital structure and view it as another means to create shareholder value. As you know, we have been in the past and continue to be willing to lever up when we either see good opportunity or view our leverage as sub-optimum for value creation. We typically begin to deleverage pretty quickly.","We have a well-proven, value-based operating strategy, focused around what we refer to as our three value drivers; new business development, continual cost improvement and value-based pricing. We stick to these concepts as the core of our operating management methodology. This consistent approach has worked for us through up and down markets and has allowed us to continually improve and increase the intrinsic value of our business while steadily investing in new business and platform positions.","We have also been successful in regularly acquiring and integrating businesses. We acquire proprietary aerospace products with significant aftermarket content. We've been able to acquire and improve proprietary aerospace businesses through all phases of the cycle. Through our consistent focus on our operating value drivers, a clear acquisition strategy, and close attention to our capital structure, we've been able to create intrinsic value for our shareholders for many years through up and down markets. This just completed quarter was again active.","In addition to all the operating activity, we closed on Harco $83 million. We also announced an agreement to buy AmSafe for about $750 million. The AmSafe price includes tax benefits over the next 10 years to TransDigm in the range of $70 million on a net present value basis. The tax benefits are front-end weighted to a certain degree.","AmSafe is a good solid proprietary aerospace business. They do about $260 million per year in revenues, with an average EBITDA margin a little under 25%. The commercial aerospace margins are higher than the average and the ground vehicle margins are substantially lower.","About 90% of the EBITDA comes from commercial aerospace and military markets, of which the vast majority is commercial aerospace. We find the low military content about 10% of revenue and a very high commercial aerospace aftermarket content particularly attractive. Excluding the commercial ground vehicle business, about 85% of the revenues are aftermarket, primarily commercial transport aftermarket.","The major product lines are seatbelts and airbags for commercial aircraft, again primarily commercial transport size. They are qualified, usually exclusively, on all major commercial transport and regional aircraft. We see opportunity to create value here through a mix of all three of our usual value drivers. Though I don't know if this business can achieve the EBITDA percent as high as the TransDigm average, we do see some significant upside.","Since we do not yet own the business and have the confidentiality agreements still in place, that's about all I can say at this point. We anticipate financing the acquisition with about $500 million of incremental bank debt, with a balance from our cash on hand. The new bank loan is fully committed and we anticipate an interest rate in the 4.5% range based on a 1% LIBOR floor. We are also seeking to increase our revolver availability at the same time. If we close on the AmSafe business, at 03\/31 we anticipate about $160 million of cash and over $285 million in undrawn revolver. ","We also on average generate over $80 million a quarter in additional cash. We have additional capacity under our credit agreement. We estimate that our net debt to EBITDA on a 12\/31 pro forma basis reflecting the AmSafe acquisition will be about 4.8 times EBITDA. As in the past, AmSafe acquisitions or other capital market activities we soon begin to de-lever.","Now, with respect to our underlying markets and on a pro forma basis, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods, the market outlook was somewhat mixed. We see continuing signs of an improving commercial market, while defense market continues less clear.","In the commercial OEM area, industry forecasters and airframe manufacturers continue to be optimistic regarding the commercial transport OEM production cycles. The rate increases seem to be proceeding at Airbus and Boeing. The 787 schedule is still unclear, but that won't materially impact TransDigm in 2012.","In total, our full year commercial transport OEM revenues on a pro forma basis are still expected to be up in the mid-teens. In the bizjet, though the outlook is mixed by airframe manufacturers, we are still comfortable with the low to mid-teen growth rate versus the prior year. This is in the bizjet OEM.","In the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see growth in worldwide passenger traffic, but not as high as last year. This quarter we saw a significant increase over the prior year Q1 in commercial aftermarket revenues. Incoming orders or bookings are running about even with the shipment levels and well above the prior year Q1 booking levels.","Sequentially, commercial aftermarket revenues were about flat, but Q1 has less shipping days than the prior quarters. We are still planning on pro forma commercial aftermarket revenues to be up about 10% versus last year. But we watch this carefully and I remind you the comps get tougher as the year goes on.","In the Defense, given the uncertainties around the Defense budgets, we anticipate Defense revenues to be flat to modestly down now in fiscal year 2012. Though Q1 was a little better than we anticipated, we remain very cautious regarding military revenues. Military revenues can be tough to predict, especially given the current U.S. political winds and the worldwide geopolitical situation.","Now let me turn to our financial performance. I\u2019ll remind you this is the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Our year started October 1, 2011. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in the OEM aftermarket mix, timing of large orders, and transient inventory fluctuations in the system, modest seasonality and other factors. But in any event, the first quarter of fiscal year '12 started off well. GAAP revenues were up 51% versus the prior year Q1. Organic revenues were up about 18% on quarter-versus-quarter basis. Reviewing the revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis, versus prior Q1, and you can look at Slide 5 to see that. This again assumes we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.","In the commercial markets, which make up about 75% of our revenue, commercial OEM revenues were up about 20% versus the prior year. Commercial transport OEM and bizjet OEM revenue percent growth were both very close to the 20%. Commercial aftermarket revenue was up about 19% on a Q1 versus Q1 basis. This is a strong increase, but I'll remind you versus a weak prior year. Commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up about 20% versus the prior year, and business jet was up somewhat less. Bookings are running about even with shipments. We are watching the trends very carefully in the commercial aftermarket.","In the defense market, which makes up about 25% of our revenue, the defense picture was again mixed. Revenues were up 7% on a quarter versus prior quarter basis and about flat versus the prior year average quarterly run rate. Incoming orders ran ahead of the shipping rate in Q1. We\u2019ll see how this plays out as the year goes on. As I said, the picture is not clear, but for obvious reasons we remain cautious about military trends. In total for the quarter, our revenues were a bit better than expected.","Moving to profitability and now on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. The major as defined adjustments are primarily made up of acquisition expenses and stock option expenses. Our EBITDA as defined was about $174 million for Q1, or up 57% versus the prior year. EBITDA as defined margin was 49.5% versus the quarter, versus 47.5% the prior year. The two-point increase is due to a number of items. To enumerate the major ones, the improved operations increased the margin by about 2.75%, a one-time contract settlement increased about 0.75% and these were partially offset by about 1.5% of acquisition dilution.","With respect to acquisitions, as I said, we completed one in Q1 2012, that was Harco, for about $83 million. As I said before, we executed a contract by AmSafe for about $750 million. This is still subject to final regulatory approval. We continue actively looking at opportunities. We've been pretty busy working the AmSafe and Harco deals. The pipeline frankly is a little light. Closings always difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities.","Now moving on to the balance of 2012 and regarding the guidance, and this is on Slide 6. There are a number of moving pieces impacting our increased guidance. Our operations performed well in Q1. The Harco acquisition closed and the tax rate is a little better or the primary impacts. I'm going to refer to the midpoint numbers of our guidance in the following discussions. I remind everybody these numbers include no contribution from AmSafe or any additional acquisitions.","Based on all of the above, we are increasing the midpoint of our EPS as adjusted guidance by $0.32 a share or from $5.51 per share at the midpoint to $5.83. We now expect TransDigm revenues to be about $1.49 million or up $40 million, which is about 3% from our prior guidance. This is primarily driven by the Harco acquisition. The 2012 EBITDA as defined is now anticipated to be in the range of $733 million a year, up $18 million from our previous guidance. This is roughly or a little over half of this from Harco and the balance primarily from improved operations.","We still expect our fiscal year 2012 results to be stronger in the second half. Our fiscal first quarter is typically the lowest in the year. Compared to 2011, we are still planning on full year commercial aerospace OEM revenues to be up about 15%. For commercial aerospace aftermarket, we are still planning on revenue growth about 10% based on worldwide traffic up 4% to 5% year-over-year. We\u2019ll keep watching this closely as the year proceeds and adjust if it's required. For defense revenues, we are planning year-over-year revenues to be flat to modestly down.","In summary, Q1 was a good start to the year. The market seems to be roughly on track. In any event, I'm confident by focusing on our consistent strategy; we can continue to create intrinsic value for our shareholders in good and bad times.","And now let me hand this over to Ray Laubenthal, our President and COO to discuss some of the operating issues from Q1.","Raymond Laubenthal","Thanks, Nick. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good first quarter. We were quite busy with acquisitions due diligence, completing transactions and transitioning acquired businesses. At our operating unit, we are also diligently working our guiding drivers and we continue to create shareholder value. Let me explain our 2012 first quarter operation value creation a little more in detail.","Four weeks before our fiscal Q1 started, we purchased Schneller. During Q1, we restructured Schneller's product pricing to better reflect the value they provide, and we organized this business unit into our proven product line operational structure.","We are also working to shut down the Schneller Florida facility and consolidate these operations these operations with the main Kent, Ohio manufacturing site. To date, the design of the Kent building expansion has been completed and we are set to break ground on the new addition this spring. We expect to complete construction this summer and physically move the Schneller Florida operations this fall. Overall, the Schneller transition activities are well underway and we expect this acquisition to meet or beat our value creation expectations.","On December 9th, we acquired Harco Labs Incorporated. To-date, we have restructured the Harco's spares pricing and tightened up the cost structure with an 18% headcount reduction. We are now working to organize this business into our proven product line operational structure. So far the transition activities are progressing well and this looks to be another good acquisition.","Now let me turn the discussion to our other operating units and their recent value generation activities. Overall, the TransDigm operating units are performing well. They have diligently controlled their cost structure and have added resources sparingly as the commercial market recovers. Our value generation activities continue to be effective across our businesses and they also contributed to our solid first quarter results. Our new business development continued to be quite active during Q1. We continue to invest in a broad range of engineered solutions for our customers. Each of our 50 plus product lines have many products in different stages of developments each quarter.","I won't do this every quarter, but this quarter. I'd like to give it a little color with some examples of our recent new business program awards for several of these product lines. Today, I'd like to highlight a few of the innovative solutions we provided for aviation water systems and electrical power management.","In water system area, we recently developed a line of water management products that reduced the weight of the aircraft and save fuel and maintenance cost. These products provide real quantifiable value for the airlines. For example, we've developed and are delivering a series of low flow faucets for use on the Boeing 737, 747 and 777. These faucets conserve water and allow the airlines that use them to fly with less water.","On the new Boeing 747-8, we're supplying a hands-free, infrared actuated faucet. This faucet only runs when hands are present. This feature conserves water and allows the airlines to carry less of it. On the Boeing 777, we've developed and are selling a very accurate water level sensor that helps the airline tightly manage and optimize the amount of water they carry. Again, the less water weight carried, the less fuel consumed by the aircraft.","To improve water quality, we've developed a ground cart ozone system that purifies the water as it's being added to the aircraft tanks. This system eliminates the need for chemical additives and the associated labor cost and it's now in use at many airports, servicing a wide variety of aircraft types. We have also developed an on-board version of this ozone system for the Boeing 737. This system keeps the on-board water clean and potable without the use of chemicals and maintenance labor.","In the area of electric power management, we've developed lighter weight electrical power inverter equipment for use on the Boeing 737, 747, 757 and the 777. These units are being used for both OEM production and existing fleet spares. On the Boeing 787, we've developed a medical outlet frequency converter. This unit provides on-board portable power for medical emergency defibrillators, ventilators and similar medical equipment that requires a 120-volt power or other voltage standards found in foreign countries.","We've also been successful getting our existing line of micro maintenance nickel cadmium batteries approved by the FAA for use on Airbus A300 and A320 platforms.","And lastly, we\u2019ve gained another platform approval for our energy saving LED mood lighting systems. We're now selling this product on the A330 for a large Asian carrier. We also continue to develop new power equipment to enhance the capabilities or extend the life of the military fleet. On the CH-53 Sea Stallion and the CH-47 Chinook helicopters, we've developed expanded clean power transformers and uninterrupted power supply equipment to enhance the onboard avionics.","On the new Sikorsky S-97 RAIDER high-speed helicopter, we were awarded the electrical power management system, which includes lithium ion battery, two power supplies and power distribution unit. On the KC-10, we have developed upgraded cockpit control panels and equipment for the KC-10 modernization program. These new engineered solutions and many others not discussed, continue to expand our profitable product offering and add to our future growth.","Now let me hand it over to Greg Rufus, our CFO, who will review the first quarter financial results in more detail.","Gregory Rufus","Thanks, Ray, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone had an opportunity to read our press release which was issued this morning. As you compare our quarterly performance versus the first quarter of last year, the impact of acquisitions, financings, and operations are all significant in the first quarter comps. Hopefully, I'll keep it simple for you today.","Before I begin, please reference Slide 7 for our quarterly financial results. Quarter one net sales were $352.5 million, up $118.9 million or 50.9% from the prior year. There are two significant explanations for this very large increase. The first is the collective impact of the acquisitions of the McKechnie, Talley and Schneller businesses, which were acquired in fiscal '11 and Harco, which we just acquired in the first quarter. These acquisitions contributed $75.9 million of additional sales versus the prior period.","Not to be overshadowed by the impact of recent acquisitions, our organic growth was very strong at 18.4% over the prior year. All market channels contributed to this growth as follows. An additional $18.2 million was from the commercial aftermarket sales, $16.6 million came from the commercial OEM and $5.6 million from defense sales driven primarily by the aftermarket.","Reported gross profit was $199.6 million or 56.6% of sales. The reported gross profit margin increased by approximately 2 percentage points, versus the prior year due to the following. It's the strength of our proprietary products, continued productivity improvement, and favorable product mix, all made favorable contributions. Also, a little favorable retroactive contract adjustment contributed approximately three quarters of a percentage point as well as positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over the higher production volume.","Collectively, these items increased our gross profit percentage on our businesses by approximately 3 margin points, which more than offset the dilutive impact from lower margin acquisitions. As a percent of sales, the impact of purchase price accounting items, that is inventory step-up and related start-up costs were about the same for both periods.","Selling and administrative expenses were 11.9% of sales for the quarter, compared to 13.1% versus the prior year. The decrease as a percent of sales was due to lower cost directly associated with acquisition-related activity, such as transaction costs and severance costs, and this is up approximately $2 million compared to the prior year quarter. These costs were 1% of sales in the current quarter versus 2.3% of sales in the prior year. Amortization of intangibles was $8.2 million higher versus the prior year due to the acquisitions made over the past 12 months. The current quarter comparison is also favorably impacted by the large refinancing costs of $70.7 million recorded last year in December 2010 as a result of the refinancing of TransDigm's then existing debt structure. This was done in conjunction with the debt raised to acquire McKechnie. To remind you, these costs are excluded from EBITDA as defined and adjusted EPS for both periods.","Net interest expense was $49.1 million, an increase of $16.5 million versus the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily caused by the increase in weighted average total debt of approximately $3.1 billion in the current quarter, versus $2.1 billion in the prior year. This is all related to the previously mentioned refinancing in quarter one of last year and our acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate and total borrowings outstanding, as of the end of the quarter, was approximately 5.9%.","Our effective tax rate was 32.3% in the current quarter, down from 34.6% in the prior year quarter. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a favorable nonrecurring adjustment to our state income tax expense of $2.6 million, which was related to changes in state tax laws. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be between 34% and 35%.","Net income for the quarter increased $72.5 million to $65.1 million, which is 18.5% of sales. This compares to a net loss of $7.4 million in the prior year. The net loss last year was primarily due to the onetime cost attributable to refinancing of the debt structure I just discussed.","GAAP EPS was $1.15 per share in the current quarter, compared to a net loss of $0.19 per share a year ago. Please note that last year the impact of refinancing cost, net of tax, was $0.87 per share on GAAP EPS. Adjusted EPS was $1.42 per share, an increase of 65% compared to $0.86 per share last year. This percentage change is higher than our sales increase of 51%, which is reflective of our improved EBITDA margin this quarter versus the prior year.","The quarter adjustments to GAAP EPS were $0.27 per share. The adjustments net of tax are acquisition-related expenses of about $0.16 per share, inclusion of the dividend equivalent payment paid in the first quarter of $0.06 per share, and non-cash compensation cost of $0.05 per share. We ended this quarter with $360 million of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt leverage ratio of 4.2 times on a pro forma EBITDA.","Now let me hand it back over to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol","Thank you, Greg. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, I'd ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. If you have further questions, I'd ask that you reinsert yourself into the queue and we will answer those questions if time permits.","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Morning. Nick, on the aftermarket, you did close to 20% in the quarter year-over-year, your guidance 10% for the full year. I understand the comps get more difficult, but can you give us idea sequentially, as we go through the year, what your 19%, 20% \u2013 sorry, your 10% guidance assumes sequentially as we go throughout the year?","Nicholas Howley","Well, as you know, David, we don't give quarterly guidance. And I don't want to back into it that way, but you can back into the math, right? If you take whatever the first quarter is and divide the rest of it with the rest of the year, you get about 6% or 7% a quarter.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Right. I was just trying to get an idea sequentially what you were looking at?","Gregory Rufus","No, we're not smart enough for that.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","No, you guys are pretty smart.","Nicholas Howley","I would say it is \u2013 as you know, when the comps get significantly harder, and we are mostly reflecting there some \u2013 no company-specific concern, but frankly just a little bit of discomfort still with where the economy goes and where the airline industry goes around the world. That's all what we are reflecting there.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","But did you see \u2013 you had mentioned last quarter that you had seen some softening in the aftermarket bookings. Did that \u2013 it seems like that recovered in the first quarter. Is that correct?","Nicholas Howley","Well, the bookings and shipments were about the same and they were up significantly off of the \u2013 they were significantly up in the previous year. I would say, sequentially, the bookings didn't change a whole lot.","Gregory Rufus","Particularly if you adjusted it for days from the prior quarter.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Okay. And last one for me. AmSafe. I know you're somewhat limited in what you can say, but you made the comment that you might not be able to get AmSafe margins up to kind of TransDigm average. Could you maybe just compare the opportunity at AmSafe relative to the opportunity that you saw at McKechnie when you started there?","Nicholas Howley","Yeah, I think the way we look at this, as you know, is we\u2019re not \u2013 we don't make any money by percents, we make the money by dollars. When we look at that, we see the same kind of \u2013 we think this is an EBITDA that over time as we always say four years or so, we think we can double this EBITDA which is the same kind of thing we saw at McKechnie. And that's a combination of the usual suspects. It's cost reduction. It's pricing. It's some new business and a little market tailwinds.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Okay. But over four years, because it looked like with McKechnie, you are going to get there a lot quicker than four years?","Nicholas Howley","Well, hopefully maybe we will do that here too. You know how we look at this. We look at this on a four to five year cash to cash kind of basis and we are looking to get the returns up in the high-teens to 20s on our equity. And this passes that test or better, we wouldn't here.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Yes, got it. Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Hugel with Stephens Inc. Please proceed.","Eric Hugel \u2013 Stephens Inc","Hey, good morning guys. Hey, can you talk about in defense side? You talked about some \u2013 the strength in there is really aftermarket driven. Can you talk about maybe any specifics the types of products, helicopters, six lane, ground vehicles?","Nicholas Howley","Well, as you may know, about 60% of our defense business roughly evenly split comes from helicopters and freighters. So that's always going to be the primary driver as is helicopters and freighters. I would say if you look across our operating units and product lines, it's I would say not all, but the high percentage of them were up this quarter. Each one has a little bit of a different story, but the spending at least for our products was a little bit than we anticipated and I really can't zero it in on one big thing.","Eric Hugel \u2013 Stephens Inc","Okay. Fair enough.","Nicholas Howley","I\u2019d like to give you a more satisfying answer than that, but looks like we\u2019re unsettled about the future. It\u2019s frankly hanging in better than we thought.","Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc","I guess that's good if it's not any one particular thing, it's broad based. That\u2019s a positive. Also when you look \u2013 in your guidance, can you give us a range of what you are looking for in terms of the adjustments for EBITDA and net income?","Gregory Rufus","With AmSafe, it's going to change a lot obviously because it's a large acquisition. We have on the table what our current adjustments are, but I'd ask you to be patient when we give out the AmSafe guidance, because the amortization and things like that \u2013 the dividend payment stays the same. That only happens in the first quarter. You could annualize the comp costs. That will probably go up because we\u2019ll issue more options with the acquisition, and then we\u2019ll have the various acquisition related expenses. So it won't be any different subjects. But again, what you see now will be updated and changed with AmSafe.","Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc","Would you plan to update the guidance when you closed AmSafe, or just at the next conference call?","Gregory Rufus","No. At our next conference call because we will in the middle of our operating, our base business that quarter. So our intention right now is to do it at the next conference call.","Nicholas Howley","Let me just add to that, Greg. I think between the public information that we\u2019ve put out, I think you have the basis for making some judgments there.","Eric Hugel - Stephens Inc","Great. Thanks a lot guys. Good quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Nick, just to go back to spares growth for a minute. Would you characterize the 19% in the quarter as what you were looking for or did that come in ahead?","Nicholas Howley","I can't find how to say. I don't \u2013 I can't say it's materially different, Rob. We were thinking 10% in the year. We are still somewhere around 10% for the year. So I don't know. Maybe a little better, maybe a little worse, but I can't say there is a material difference.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","I only asked the question because you actually adjusted your annual outlook on defense growth, but not here. So I'm wondering if this just actually came in you really expected a front ended year?","Nicholas Howley","I would say I guess I maybe front-ended, Rob, if you compare as a percent. But remember the comps get a lot harder as you go forward.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","True. Fair enough. Okay. And then could you give us the latest on pricing?","Nicholas Howley","Pricing of what?","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Just pricing in general, the customers\u2019 acceptance of pricing and how prices are fairing in this environment, perhaps compared to previous periods?","Nicholas Howley","There has been no significant change in the pricing dynamics in the industry for our products, Rob. We haven't seen any change this quarter in this period as we did in previous up and down cycles. I mean, our process and our activities remain the same and our results remain the same.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just for Greg, you mentioned the contract adjustment. Are there any others embedded in the guidance going forward? Should we see any more adjustments like that?","Gregory Rufus","No. Right now that happened in this quarter. So we wanted to carve it out for you.","Nicholas Howley","Let me just add to that. We have some number of these negotiations going on in any one-time. Sometimes they stretch out forever and never get resolved and sometimes they all of a sudden pop overnight and get resolved. So it's doesn't mean there is no possibility of it anymore, but there is none in guidance.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks so much.","Gregory Rufus","But, it's not in the guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank","Oh, hi there. Good morning. It's Amit Mehrotra here for Myles. Just looking at the guidance, the $0.32 increase at the midpoint, it looks like maybe $0.10 is from Harco, another $0.05 from tax. So that leaves about $0.15 to $0.20 from improved operations. Can you just give us some color on where specifically you're seeing the better performance?","Nicholas Howley","It's better to look at it almost a third, a third, a third by the subjects you mentioned. I don't know what you read but those improvements really closed out in that way. Tax, a third; Harco, a third and ops a third.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then the third that's from better performance, can you just point to specifically where in the business you're seeing that?","Gregory Rufus","We're just generally being pretty excited with the headcount and as the market recovers and we're also enjoying the benefits of some of the reductions we've had with acquisitions over the last 12 months. We are seeing a full year of that.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just the commercial aftermarket performance, up at 19% was quite strong and I think the comp was up 20% the same quarter a year ago. So just considering global capacity was up 5% in the quarter, can you just help us bridge the gap between the up 19% and the up 5% for capacity growth?","Nicholas Howley","Well, obviously somebody was buying more than the capacity growth was. This is the same issue we saw all of last year and we're continuing some of it here in the beginning. The quarter-to-quarter \u2013 first quarter to first quarter is the easiest comp. It gets tougher from here on in. So the answer is generally the same answer we had last year. We are aware the people who are buying, they\u2019re buying ahead of the \u2013 I would say the consumption and the pricing, and there's a little extra buying we suspect for inventory and some deferred maintenance. We don't know if these comps get tougher. We don't know that that can continue.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And just last question and just a quick clarification. On the pro forma growth by end market that you provide in the deck, does pro forma mean you include acquisition related revenue in both periods or does it excluding acquisition related revenue in both periods?","Nicholas Howley","It includes it. It presumes we own the same mix of businesses the prior year that we own this year.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank","Got it. Okay, thanks. Great quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of J. B. Groh with D. A. Davidson. Please proceed.","J. B. Groh \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my call. I just want to clarify. I think you mentioned some pricing action on Harco and Schneller, but from the other questions it sounds like you didn't make \u2013 take any other pricing action with the core business this quarter?","Gregory Rufus","We mentioned Harco and Schneller just because after we acquire a business, we quickly go to work on that stuff. But in our base businesses, our pricing actions have been same as they\u2019ve been every year and every quarter.","J. B. Groh - D. A. Davidson & Co","So was there a general price increase in Q1?","Gregory Rufus","We don't have a general price increase necessarily. The product line is handled differently. But I mean as I\u2019ll try to track back on the question that Rob asked. Our pricing pattern, our pricing methodology has not changed.","Nicholas Howley","We just don't talk about it every quarter. Ray talks a little bit about the new acquisitions.","J. B. Groh - D. A. Davidson & Co","Right. Now I understand why don't want to give too much away there. And then maybe playing up the last question, maybe give us the thought on the level of inventory customers. How are you seeing that? Obviously, there is a little bit of inventory build here, but do you have a sense in what those inventory levels are relative to historic level?","Nicholas Howley","I don't have a good sense of it. I think the best way to think about that is look at our guidance for the balance of the year.","J. B. Groh - D. A. Davidson & Co","Okay. Thanks for your help.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Leake with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question. Defense last quarter, we had down low single digits and now it's flat to modestly down. Is that an improvement in the Defense outlook, just because your handing is flat, or is there no change?","Gregory Rufus","It will probably be a little. I think our previous guidance was modestly down. We changed from flat to modestly down. Primarily, of course we had a good first quarter than we expected. There is nothing I would say there is \u2013 I can't tell you there is anything about the Defense world or the outlook that makes me feel a whole lot different than I did 90 days ago, other than we got 90 days under the belt that was a little better than we expected.","Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then, this is really splitting hairs, but I\u2019ll ask it. Last quarter for OEM it was mid-teens, now it's 15%. That's the same. Your outlook hasn't really changed?","Nicholas Howley","Yes. No, the outlook hasn't changed.","Carter Leake - BB&T Capital Markets","Last quarter also we had 787 commentary as one of the assumptions, 15 and 12, 15 and 13. That\u2019s been dropped. Does that matter anymore or do you have a more favorable outlook?","Nicholas Howley","No. I think when I said about the 787 is the \u2013 it's unclear to me exactly what the shipment rates are going to be this year. As you probably know, the number seems to sort of move around. But I would say, it didn\u2019t want to make a lot of \u2013 it's not a material impact on TransDigm's performance this year. Surely not on the profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.","Mayur Manmohansingh - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning guys. This is Mayur in for Carter. First, let me just congratulate you on a good quarter. Nick, can you talk a little bit about the deal pipeline? Specifically can you talk about any changes that you're seeing with regards to seller expectations?","Nicholas Howley","I don't know that we're seeing any changes. As I think I've told you, if I look at it today, probably the pipeline is a little light. I don't know that I can attribute that to anything other than normal fluctuations. And as you probably know that you've been following our calls, the relationship between what I say about our pipeline and the timing of closing seems to have almost no relationship to each other. So take it for what it's worth.","Mayur Manmohansingh - Barclays Capital","This is hard to predict?","Nicholas Howley","This is hard to predict. I mean, we are out there slugging away every day, looking for things and sometimes they have a slow bubble and a boil and they start to go to a pipeline and we contract them and sometimes they just come up fast and we have to hit quick.","Mayur Manmohansingh - Barclays Capital","And in terms of the seller expectations, any changes there in terms of the pricing?","Gregory Rufus","I don't think so. I can't say that the pricing expectations have changed materially.","Mayur Manmohansingh - Barclays Capital","Okay, great. Thank you very much and good quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning guys and good quarter. The EBITDA as defined margin guidance for the rest of the year is flat to a little down from Q1. Is that just mix as you think OE will grow faster, or is there anything else to consider in there?","Gregory Rufus","It's the acquisition mix mostly.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","But AmSafe is not in there?","Nicholas Howley","There is nothing there for AmSafe.","Gregory Rufus","That's correct.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","So why would there be acquisition mix?","Gregory Rufus","We have Harco. We just acquired Schneller. Typically when we buy something, it's mathematically we\u2019ll mix down in that first year.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Right. But you've got a lot of that in the first quarter and I would have thought there would have been upside from those as you pulled some cost out?","Nicholas Howley","Harco was bought in the first week of December.","Gregory Rufus","We did tell you we had that unusual favorable pricing adjustment in our first quarter too, which distorts the first quarter in your analysis.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Right. Okay. On AmSafe, it's maybe too early for you to talk about this before you close, but is there potentially a non-core piece to it as there was with McKechnie? And obviously looking at the ground vehicle piece in particular, is that separable in theory maybe would be the right question. And then also on AmSafe, just to get this in, on Slide 39 of the deck for the lenders that you put out a few days ago, you have $25 million of amortization in there. Is that intangibles and is that going to change once you have readjusted the balance sheet?","Gregory Rufus ","No. That won't change. That will go with us forward.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And the separability of the business?","Gregory Rufus","Yes. It's reasonably severable. We're undecided yet what we'll do with that. We're going to have to look at it and see what the market is for and see what we \u2013 how we feel about the prospects when we get right into the middle of it. It's a relatively small part of the value of the business. So we're not as intimately familiar with it as we are with the aerospace and military portion.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay.","Gregory Rufus","But it is \u2013 the answer is yes, it's separable.","Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Perfect. Thank you.","Nicholas Howley","Not to get technical on the amortization. That\u2019s part of that tax savings with the (inaudible) selection if you follow that other presentation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Wedbush. Please proceed.","Kenneth Herbert \u2013 Wedbush","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to revisit McKechnie. Could you provide an update on where you stand? I know obviously you are \u2013 with the facilities and the reorganizations you are doing there and the broader progress relative to where you expect it to be at this point?","Raymond Laubenthal","Yes, the unit of McKechnie that saw the most facility closures and moves was the Electromech division and the Tyee move up in the \u2013 with Avtech. Both of those pretty much are completed. They are in the last call, I reported on that. The Avtech facility \u2013 our existing Avtech facility moves into the Tyee plant and that's all consolidated and we are marketing the Avtech property that hasn't sold yet. And then Electromech, we consolidated a bunch of units into their Mexico facility, but we had to move across town in Matamoros, Mexico because we outgrew the facility and all that work was done in the prior three quarters and completed last quarter, and that's running smoothly. We are happy with that.","Nicholas Howley","By and large I would say on the McKechnie business, it continues to meet or exceed our expectations when we bought it.","Kenneth Herbert \u2013 Wedbush","But it sounds like from the commentary you just gave that you would still characterize it as ahead of plan in terms of the actions and the improvements?","Nicholas Howley","Yeah, I would say it meets or exceeds our expectations, where we felt we\u2019d be today.","Kenneth Herbert \u2013 Wedbush","Got it. And then if I could on the aftermarket. Your book to bill this quarter of about one, does the guidance assume that that sort of holds at around the one rate for the rest of the year? Or does the guidance assume that you maybe see a point later on in the year where bookings maybe start to trail billings a little bit in any particular quarters. Is there any commentary you can make around that?","Nicholas Howley","Yeah, I can't say that. I mean we forecast the revenues, not the bookings. Generally they are way disconnected in the aftermarket because the turns aren't that long.","Kenneth Herbert \u2013 Wedbush","Okay, great. Thank you very much and great quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Callahan with Auriga Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Callahan - Auriga Securities","Thanks guys and a great quarter. I guess just a couple of questions about the organic growth rate here in the first quarter and I guess the delta between general market growth. You guys always seem to outpace that in general. I was curious, could you give us any insight as to I guess volume versus price on that 18% of price, like maybe a little bit bigger share than usual, just because you have so many acquired businesses that are all going through that, the price adjustment process?","Nicholas Howley","Well, we don't comment on our pricing. We just don't comment on that.","Michael Callahan - Auriga Securities","Okay. Well, I\u2019ll take a stab in a different way. Is it greater magnitude than other quarters?","Nicholas Howley","It is. We just don't comment on the pricing. You\u2019re welcome to try again if you want.","Michael Callahan - Auriga Securities","No, I\u2019ll take two strikes. I guess another thing I was curious about, on the SG&A line, it seems like SG&A is drifting higher a little bit. I would presume there is a lot of acquisition related expenses that you are going through, and what not, pushing it higher. But as a normalized run rate, I guess how should we think about SG&A? Have some of the acquisitions may be added permanent costs to that or should we expect it to come back down a little bit?","Nicholas Howley","Well, your first assumption in the first quarter is exactly right. There was some severance costs and some transaction costs, I think it totaled about $3 million. You\u2019ll see that in the Q when we file that tomorrow. When you say what the normal run rate, it depends how you place it with the acquisition cost and accounting cost, because now you have to expense all those things, where a couple two years ago you could put them on the balance sheet. But if you took that out, you're just a little north, I think right around 11% or just south of 11% if you took out the acquisitions for the first quarter, and that's not terribly off from how we've been reporting for several years.","Michael Callahan - Auriga Securities","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael Ciarmoli \u2013 KeyBanc","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick, I guess you detailed a lot here about the aftermarket and maybe what the trajectory is for the next couple of quarters. Can you comment on maybe how the order activity has been for sparing on sort of the 787, 747-8? If that's had an impact and maybe what you are expecting on that side going forward?","Nicholas Howley","I haven't seen anything significant on the 787. I don't know if we've seen anything Greg.","Gregory Rufus","The big initial provisioning, in fact we haven't seen that.","Nicholas Howley","We haven't seen that yet. Well, the 747. I don't\u2026","Gregory Rufus","747-8.","Nicholas Howley","Yeah. It's not been significant. I can't say we didn't get anything. Frankly, it's a little hard to sort out from existing 747 orders. The answer to that one is I don't know whether we've got any, but I know it's not been significant.","Michael Ciarmoli \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the deal side, given AmSafe, is it fair to say you might be opening up the aperture a little bit looking for larger transactions? I mean even maybe expanding the margin profile given that AmSafe didn't quite have maybe EBITDA margins that you are historically used to. Just kind of how should we look at the deal pipeline? I mean, I guess, are we going to be seeing deals of a larger size going forward?","Nicholas Howley","The real answer to that is I don't know. Our criteria stays the same. We're looking for proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. I would tell you AmSafe, if you separate out the ground vehicle business, is pretty well right down the pike on that. The size \u2013 Michael, we deal with the sizes we see. The market, there are many more small businesses \u2013 there's many more businesses or many more transactions in the $50 million, $100 million range than there are in the $700 million, $800 million range. We deal with the ones we\u2019ve got.","Gregory Rufus","Yeah. I mean, Harco came up, it was small.","Nicholas Howley","Yeah, we're not systematically changing what we're looking for.","Michael Ciarmoli \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then just structurally, I mean, it seems like EBITDA margins might be under pressure given this deal, given maybe OE revenues growing faster than aftermarket. So '13 we might see adjusted EBITDA margins be down a little bit from '12. Is that a fair assumption?","Nicholas Howley","We're not going to give guidance for '13 yet. But you can do the \u2013 the base businesses, I would say, we gave guidance where we kind of look like we are for the year and we gave you some rough numbers on AmSafe. So you can do some math there, right? When you add 25% to 50%, you get an average.","Gregory Rufus","Again, we don't manage to a margin. We manage to absolute dollars and value. So if the market mix changes, so be it. We're not going to do anything to manage our margin. We're doing it to manage the value.","Michael Ciarmoli \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Morning. Nick, how do we kick off with the slide on the guidance rate? You said you expect after market to be normal going forward. ","Nicholas Howley","To be what?","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Normal going forward. Are you referring to this sort of mathematical 6% to 7% or more like this 10% number for the full year?","Gregory Rufus","I'm not sure I follow the question. So let me repeat what we said. We said 10% for the full year, which if you do the math, if it was 18% or 19% for the first quarter, that solves the 7 percentage for the next three quarters, assuming they are all weighted equally and all that.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Do you see 7% as normal in inverted colors? Or is that just really impacted by the tough comps? Because that would seem to be the low versus what the\u2026","Gregory Rufus","I think more impacted by the tough comps. I would say what we're basically doing is we're sticking with our 10% for the year.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Okay. And then secondly\u2026","Nicholas Howley","Let me back up on that. I don't mean to imply that we think there is any structural change. The mix aftermarket go forward growth reflects 6% or 7% forever, rather than 5% plus price or something.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Yeah. And then on the capital front, obviously AmSafe a relatively large acquisition for you. Have you seen any change in your lenders in terms of their willingness and ability to lend you the amounts you\u2019re after or the rates you like given the capital constraints of banks?","Gregory Rufus ","No, we have not. We have a very \u2013 I don't want to say easy, but ready access to the capital markets. So we could raise more than we need right now.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Is that something that worries you going forward or are you pretty comfortable with this still?","Nicholas Howley","Worries what, our need or ability to get it?","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Generally the situation the banks have there in these tougher capital requirements of the rest.","Gregory Rufus","I mean, obviously we \u2013 tougher capital requirements ultimately could squeeze down the market. I would tell you, we have so far have not frankly ever had difficulty accessing the capital markets, and we don't see any right now.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Great. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer","Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I want to ask you about the AmSafe acquisition. Can you give us a little more color about how the tax benefits layer in and how those impact reported earnings?","Nicholas Howley","Well, you won't see it in our effective tax rates. Those benefits will lower our cash taxes paid. We said the net present values right around $70 million. About $30 million, $35 million of that we\u2019ll recognize in the first two years. That might stretch over two of our reporting years, maybe three because we're going to buy it in the middle of our year. But over the first 24 months, I anticipate our cash taxes to be reduced by $35 million. But again you won't see that in any change to our effective tax rate.","Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer","Got it. Thank you. And then the question about the guidance for OEM growth. You've mentioned the 787 or the 747 are going to be major drivers. Maybe you can discuss which platforms will be responsible for the bulk of that growth? Thank you.","Nicholas Howley","I think the way to do that is we're pretty well spread across the platform. So if you look at the growth rates, the Boeing Airbus are projecting in a different platform. That roughly is reflective of the growth rate we're seeing in the platforms. The 787, frankly we don't know how many we\u2019re going to ship this year or anybody does, but it won't make a big impact on the business. It's not a material impact. Anything in the range that\u2019s being talked about is an impact this year for us.","Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is a follow up from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Yeah, I wanted to ask you Nick, I don't know if this is you or Greg, but especially I think Ray made a comment on the new acquisitions and the pricing there. But is it fair to say that you get the greatest increase from pricing in the first anniversary of an acquisition because of the initial price increases?","Nicholas Howley","I would say, Rob, as a general statement, though I think you have to be a little careful business by business, because it's somewhat of a function of whether they\u2019ve contracted for fixed periods of time. In general, that's right, but it's not right in every specific.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","The reason I'm asking, I'm not sure exactly how you calculate it. You\u2019ve talked about organic, reflects the same mix of businesses in the prior year quarter, I guess to true things up. So is what we're seeing here in Q1 some benefit of the price increases coming through from McKechnie and maybe for the other two? I know you bought McKechnie or you had closed in the first week of December.","Nicholas Howley","Yes, some.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","So is that a more significant contribution than it might be in a normalized quarter or you didn't have some large acquisitions in the prior year?","Nicholas Howley","You mean you're talking specifically about the aftermarket now, Rob.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","I\u2019m talking about the aftermarket and the fact that maybe what we're doing here in Q1 this year versus Q1 last year is comparing McKechnie on a pre-price increase and a post-price increase basis?","Gregory Rufus","In the prior quarter, we only effectively owned McKechnie for about two weeks.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Well, I know you bought it on December 6. But do you \u2013 in calculating your organic growth do you push it back at the beginning of the quarter?","Nicholas Howley","Yeah, there's probably some. I don't think it's a whole lot just in that period. But yeah, there's some.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. Wanted to check on that. Thank you.","Nicholas Howley","Yeah, just by the math there is, Rob. There has to be, obviously.","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [Yumar Habib] with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Yumar Habib \u2013 JPMorgan","Thank you. One financial policy capital structure question. Can you walk us through your thought process in deciding in finance and acquisitions via the bank market versus the high yield market?","Nicholas Howley","This time it was \u2013 we wanted to do something relatively quickly. We had just restructured both our bank and high yield just a year ago, so the agreements were pretty fresh. And at the end of the day, the bank interest rate is quite a bit cheaper than the high yield. So at this stage, we elected to just go with the bank debt to go quick and we had agreements that were pretty fresh and it was pretty easy for us to execute.","Yumar Habib \u2013 JPMorgan","Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Liza Sabol for any closing remarks.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. I would like to thank everyone for participating on this morning's call and we expect to file our first quarter 10-K tomorrow.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today conference.

Have a great day."],"20904":["TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) Q1 2019 Results Conference Call February  5, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Liza Sabol - Investor Relations","Nick Howley - Executive Chairman","Kevin Stein - President and Chief Executive Officer","Mike Lisman - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Carter Copeland - Melius Research","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Myles Walton - UBS","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research","Ken Herbert - Canaccord","David Strauss - Barclays","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust","Gautam Khanna - Cowen","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Peter Arment - Baird","Jason Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Seth Seifman - JPMorgan","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to your Q1 2019 TransDigm Group Incorporated Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference will be recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Liza Sabol, with Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Liza Sabol ","Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings conference call. Presenting this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next week and dial-in information can be found in this morning's press release or on our Web site at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available on our Web site or at sec.gov.","We'd also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income earnings per share to those measures.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley","Good morning, and thanks for calling in. Today, I'll start off with summary concepts or comments, as usual and our consistent strategy, a few comments on the fiscal year and first quarter fiscal year, a quick update on the Esterline deal and related issues and a few comments on the status of the inspector general audit.","Kevin and Mike will review the business performance for the quarter and the outlook for the year. To reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and over three quarters of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which typically have higher margins and provide relative stability in the downturn.","Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation, as well as careful allocation of our capital. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. Specifically, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple well proven value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a very decentralized organization structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with our shareholders. Fourth, we acquired businesses that fit with our strategy and where we see a clear path to a PE like return. And lastly, our capital structure and our capital allocation are a keep part of our value creation methodology.","Fiscal year '19 is off to a good start. Q1 revenues EBITDA as adjusted and EBITDA margins were up nicely over the prior year. The incoming orders were strong and well ahead of shipments across all major market segments, boding well for the balance of the year. As you can see, we have increased our guidance for the year. The revised guidance excludes any contribution from the expected Esterline acquisition. Though, we had a very nice booking quarter, one quarter does not make a trend. But if this continues, we could well increase the guidance again next quarter. Kevin will expand on both the quarter and the full-year outlook.","Our liquidity is strong. We had $2.3 billion of cash at the end of fiscal year Q1. Based on our recently announced financing and assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market activity other than the Esterline transaction, we still expect to be somewhere in the range of $3 billion of cash at the end of the fiscal year. We also expect to have over $600 million of unused revolver and some additional room under our credit agreement. We continue to actively evaluate and seek M&A opportunities. We have a decent pipeline of mostly small and midsize possibilities. I can't predict or comment on possible closings, but we are still working steadily in M&A. As I said, we're open for business.","A few comments about Esterline transaction status and some related issues. As I think you know, we're paying about $4 billion for roughly $2 billion in revenue. Based on the public consensus information of about $330 million of fiscal year '19 EBITDA, we estimate this is about 12 times EBITDA multiple, again I'm trying to speak consensus '19 EBITDA. With respect to regulatory clearance, that is antitrust and foreign investment approval, things are moving along well so far. In the United States, the HSR waiting period expired back in November. So we're clear to close with the FDC and the Department of Justice. All other required regulatory views are now complete with the exception of the European commission antitrust review, and the French foreign investment review. These are proceeding through smoothly, and we expect to obtain approvals in a timely manner. As a reminder, we did not need to file for regulatory approval in China.","In addition, Esterline has received shareholder approval for the transaction. Overall, the process is moving along well. And at this time, we now hope to close in the March, April time frame. That is sooner than the Q4 timeframe we originally estimated. However, it's not finished yet, so there's always some uncertainty till it's concluded. As we said before, we think Esterline has been a misunderstood company; its core aero defense business make-up three quarters or more of the revenues; its core business has proprietary content and sole-source positions quite similar as a percent of revenue to TransDigm. The core aftermarket also appears significant. We estimate this at over 30% of revenue.","So we have not made any final decisions on that disposition at this time, I do expect that we will be selling certain assets that don't fit well with our progress. We are still working on specifics and finding, so I don't have any more to share on this topic at this time. We have now arranged the financing for the Esterline transaction. Last week, we priced about $4 billion of secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and a term of seven years. This is scheduled to fund on February 13th. This new financing will result in an average weighted cash interest rate on our total debt of about 5.7%. This is very close to the rate that we gave for the year with our original 2019 guidance.","Additionally, we decided to refinance the $550 million of our high-yield bonds that comes due in 2020 in order to push the maturities out until 2027. Including the new debt and the hedges and followers, we will have approximately 80% of our debt fixed or hedged, and we'll remain close to that level for the next five years. I don\u2019t expect that our net leverage at close will be out of line with our recent levels. And if market conditions hold, we should still have the adequate flexibility to consider the full range of capital allocation alternatives. We will likely defer any other 2019 decisions on capital allocation until after we close the Esterline transaction and assess the overall business and capital market environment at that time. Absent any other acquisition or capital market activity, we would still de-lever about one turn a year.","With respect to the Inspector General or IG audit, we and several defense Department of Defense contracting agencies, primarily the Defense Logistics Agency, known as DLA, have now received the draft report. The DLA is the largest of the buying agencies that were audited in this report. There has been no allegation of any wrongdoing or illegal. As in the past, the Department of Defense buying agencies are requesting a voluntary refund of some profits. The sum of the various individual requests appears total about $16 million. Again, this is a voluntary request and there is no assertion that this is a financial obligation of the company. The governments are good customer and like any good customer, we want to be responsive where practical. We are glad to have the IG report concluded. We understand that the report will be available to the public within a few months.","Now, let me hand this over to Kevin, who will discuss both Q1 '19 performance, as well as the full year outlook.","Kevin Stein","Thanks Nick. Today, I'll review our results by key markets then discuss the profitability of the business for the quarter. And finally provide revised guidance for the fiscal year. As you've seen, we had a strong first quarter and a good start to the year. Mike will provide more details on the financials. But our first quarter operations, revenue and EBITDA as defined, were up nicely over last year.","Q1 GAAP revenues were up 17% versus prior year Q1 and EBITDA as defined was up 21% over the prior year with strong margins and 49% of revenue. Bookings or incoming orders are the real story here, however, with pro forma of Q1 bookings up 20% compared to the year-ago period, a robust increase observed across all aerospace market segments.","Now, we will review our revenues by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis, compared to the prior year periods in 2018. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes-up close to 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion to OEM and aftermarket. In our commercial OEM market, Q1 revenues have increased approximately 13% when compared with Q1 of fiscal year 2018. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make-up the majority of our commercial OEM business, were up 10% in Q1 when compared to the prior year period.","Bookings in the quarter were strong and outpaced sales by a wide margin. For most of 2018, we commented that the softness we were experiencing in the OEM market was a transient as our ship-set content had experienced no negative revisions. Now in Q1 of fiscal year '19, we are seeing growth across narrowbody and widebody form factors once again. As we said at the time, revenues can be lumpy due to a number of factors.","Business jet helicopter OEM revenues make-up around 20% of our commercial OEM revenues. Revenues in this combined market were up over 20% compared to the same period in 2018. Bookings in this submarket outpaced sales in total with strong business jet bookings, slightly offset by some weakness in helicopter bookings. Although, business jet delivery forecasts continue to look positive for 2019, driven largely by larger cabin jets, the robust sales growth experienced this quarter is not likely sustainable. In addition, the smaller revenue helicopter market may be a slight headwind going forward.","Now, moving on to our commercial aftermarket business. Total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by just over 6% in the quarter. Both the commercial transport and business jet helicopter aftermarket revenues were up close to the average of 6% over the prior year quarter. Bookings well outpaced sales in the quarter, and year-over-year bookings growth came in at over 20% in this important market segment. The aftermarket freight segment continues to outperform our expectations within this composite. Time will tell if this continues as the freight market fundamentals have slowed.","Now, let me speak about our defense market, which is just over 30% of our total revenue. The defense market, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, was up approximately 50% of the prior year Q1. Revenue growth was well distributed across our business. For Q1 of fiscal year '19, defense aftermarket revenue growth also outpaced defense OEM growth. Total defense bookings continued the recent trends and were up significantly over prior year, and have similarly outpaced sales by a nice margin. This is a similar narrative to fiscal year '18 but we are now seeing those bookings materialize in the sales.","Moving to profitability, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. EBITDA as defined of about $487 million for Q1 was up 21% versus prior Q1. EBITDA as defined margin in the quarter was 49% of revenues. This includes one margin point of dilution from the fiscal year '18 acquisitions of Kirkhill, Extant and Skandia. Excluding the acquisitions, margins improved approximately 2.5 points year-over-year for the same period. Margin improvement progress is always important to us. It indicates that our base business continues to find opportunities to drive improvement within our value drivers. We are relentless in our approach to value generation.","Turning now to 2019 guidance. We are modestly increasing our fiscal year 2019 full-year sales and EBITDA guidance, both by $20 million, to reflect our strong first quarter results. However, until we see more data, we are not updating the full year market assumptions at this time as the underlying fundamentals do not seem to have meaningfully changed. The midpoint of our fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance is now $4.19 billion. The revenue guidance is still based on the following market channel growth rate assumptions; we expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth of mid-to-high-single-digit percent versus prior year; commercial OEM revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digit percent range; and defense military revenue growth of mid-to-high-single-digit percent versus prior year.","The midpoint of fiscal year 2019 EBITDA as defined guidance is now $2.09 billion with an expected margin of around 50%. This includes approximately one margin point of dilution for the recent acquisitions purchased in fiscal year '18, implying our pre-fiscal year '18 core is now at about 51% margin. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS $0.50 to $16.76 per share, primarily resulting from higher EBITDA guidance and slightly lower interest expense. Mike will discuss in more detail shortly.","Finally, let me briefly speak to our organization structure. With the impending completion of the Esterline acquisition, the need for experienced leadership increases. To account for this, we have moved Jim Skulina, a long-term TransDigm operations executive and most recently, our interim CFO to lead the financial integration of Esterline. And additionally, added two seasoned Executive Vice Presidents, Joel Reiss and Pete Palmer to also be part of the Esterline acquisition integration team reporting to Bob Henderson. To backfill this need, we have promoted Paula Wheeler to Executive Vice President. Paula has been with TransDigm since 1995, and has served in a number of leadership roles. She was most recently President of Aero Fluid products for the past seven years.","As a reminder, we promoted Roderigo Rubiono and Alex Feil in our early 2018 to build capacity and EVP ranks for expected acquisitions. As always, we continue to focus on developing a deep bench of diverse culture carriers for future succession need.","With that, I would now like to turn it over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.","Mike Lisman","Thanks Kevin. I'll recap the financial highlights for the first quarter, and then provide some more info on the guidance update. First quarter net sales were $993 million, up 17% from the prior year. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 11.6% and the balance of the sales increase was from our three fiscal '18 acquisitions, Kirkhill, Extant, and Skandia.","Our first quarter gross profit increased 18% to $564 million and was 56.8% of sales compared to 56.2% in the first quarter of the prior year. As called out on the Slide comments, we had 1.5 points of margin headwind from the new acquisitions, but still made it to over 1.5 point of gross margin improvement from the execution of our value drivers on the base business.","Moving on to taxes, the year-over-year comparisons get slightly confusing here due to the one-time impact of tax reform last year. This also is the year-over-year EPS comparisons. For the first quarter, our effective GAAP income tax rate was a provision of 21.5% compared to a benefit of 63.4% in last year's first quarter. To remind you, last year our tax rates were significantly reduced due to the enactment of tax reform in the U.S., and we recorded a one-time net benefit of $147 million. There is no update to our full year effective tax rate assumptions at this time. So excluding Esterline, we're still anticipating the GAAP cash and adjusted rates to all be in the range of 21% to 23%.","Moving onto EPS, I want to first point out that the decrease in both the current quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS was due to the previously mentioned enactment of tax reform. If you remove the one-time benefit of $147 million, which equates to $2.65 per share so that you can do an apples-to-apples comparison of the '18 to '19 growth rates, you'd get Q1 FY18 GAAP EPS of $1.95. The current quarter GAAP EPS of $3.05 per share then represents an increase of 56% over this prior year figure.","Similarly, excluding the one-time impact of tax reform, Q1 FY18 adjusted EPS would be $2.93 per share. Our current quarter adjusted EPS of $3.85 is then up 31% over this prior year figure. Table three in this morning's press release reconciles GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS, so you can look for more detail there.","Switching gears to cash and liquidity, we generated almost $330 million of cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion cash on the balance sheet. Our net-debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.4 times pro forma EBITDA as defined and gross leverage was 6.6 times. Excluding Esterline, we still estimate that our cash will grow steadily throughout the year to around $3 billion, and our net leverage at December 30, 2019 will be around 4.8 times our EBITDA as defined.","With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $15.10 and we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share to be $16.76. The primary reasons for the increase in both GAAP and adjusted EPS were the increase in our EBITDA guidance and also lower expected interest expense. However, the increase to the GAAP EPS was partially offset by higher expected acquisition related costs related to Esterline.","Excluding any new debt from the Esterline acquisition, we're now expecting net interest expense to be $725 million for the full year, a decrease from our previous expectation of $745 million. The lower expected interest expense is primarily due to a slight decline in the projected LIBOR rate for the year and higher interest income booked in Q1 compared to a conservative forecast. This $725 million completely excludes any interest expense from the $4 billion of new debt we'll be incurring to complete the Esterline acquisition.","Slide 9, shows a bridge of detailing the $1.66 of adjustments between GAAP to adjusted earnings per share. In summary, Q1was a solid start to fiscal 2019. Finally, a quick organizational update. During the quarter, Sarah Wynne became our Chief Accounting Officer. Sarah has worked with TransDigm in various accounting functions for the past 15 years, both as a group controller and prior to that, the controller at Aero Fluid products. Sarah has a solid financial background, is a strong promoter of the TransDigm culture and has already settled into her new role.","With that I'll turn it back over the Liza.","Liza Sabol","Thanks Mike. Before we open the lines, I'd ask you to just keep your questions to two per caller and then reinsert yourself into the queue, to allow everyone to have an opportunity to ask questions. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland","Just two quick ones. One, Kevin or Nick, I wondered if you could comment on what look like pretty strong quarter of performance out of Esterline. I mean, I know you've obviously have enclosed and whatnot, but just looking at that set of results and it stood out. I wondered if you might give us some color on what you, from the outside end, what you thought may have driven that and how you fill about it? And secondly, just with respect to the recent news flow around the A380 and the potential closure of that line and into that product. What you think the risks maybe? Obviously, when we close a product line, there is destocking and stuff that happens that can be somewhat abrupt. And I just wondered if you could maybe walk us through your thoughts on that?","Nick Howley","Yes, let me address the first and Kevin will take the second question. Carter, we just don\u2019t want to comment on the first quarter public filing by Esterline. I don't think it's our place to elaborate on that. It\u2019s not our place yet to elaborate on their public filing. So I'm just going to have to pass on that.","Kevin Stein","And Carter on the A380, I've read the same announcements and news. We're starting to study what if any real impact that would be. The A380 rates have come down quite a bit over the last little while, so effective in real. So the contribution in our numbers is not huge. So we need to study that more and have a better answer in the future.","Carter Copeland","Do you sense, Kevin, that there's a decent amount of inventory in the system?","Kevin Stein","I do not have a sense for that to be honest. I think that it's been held pretty closely. So I don't have better inside there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Spingarn","I wanted to talk about the margin a little bit. It was quite strong, notwithstanding, I guess, some of that dilution from acquisitions. The gross margin, I think both in the fourth quarter the fourth fiscal quarter and in this quarter, are as good as I've seen a while. Kevin, could you delve into that a little bit? And to what extent is that operating leverage, productivity, pricing, what are we looking at here?","Kevin Stein","I think we're looking at all of our value drivers coming into place. It's all of contributions, whether it's we're driving value pricing or productivity, or winning new business. So it's really everything, I can't comment that one is more successful than the other in the current quarter.","Robert Spingarn","And then just a quick one. You mentioned the higher acquisition expenses for Esterline, I guess Mike did. Is there anything specific to that?","Mike Lisman","Its banker fees and legal fees for the most part that you see written through what's in there today.","Robert Spingarn","And just higher than expected -- I mean, is that typical in what you've seen in the past, or is there anything notable?","Mike Lisman","Given the size of this acquisitions, those dollar amounts are higher than the typical there.","Nick Howley","Given the size of this acquisition, but I don\u2019t think the fees are any difference than we thought. The fees are what we thought they'd be.","Operator","Thank you. Our following question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is now open.","Myles Walton","Nick, I was wondering if you could, or Kevin, comment on the integrations required. Obviously, it sounds it get hard and\/or promoted a few people to add to Bob's integration team for Esterline. And I'm them curious you have $3 billion pro forma cash on the balance sheet at year-end. Would you enter enough acquisitions to satisfy that amount, or you almost feel a little overwhelmed with Esterline integration? How do you balance the availability of your cash for versus the availability of your talent to integrate?","Nick Howley","Yes, let me say, you are right. We have a lot of cash we're building up and we borrow a lot of money to -- and we borrowed and we're maintaining that. I don\u2019t know, Myles, what we will do with that. I would say we would be reticent to take on right now an acquisition of the size of Esterline again, so we swallowed that a little bit. It would have to be a hugely compelling value for us to look at that. But the normal range of acquisitions, I would think we're fine for. And I think your follow-up questions what you're doing with all the cash and the answer to that is we'll decide after we buy. We will take a look at could we get this acquisition close, we'll see what the range of opportunities look like and we will make a decision.","Kevin Stein","I don\u2019t have much to answer. But to say that succession planning has been an important parts of this company's process for quite a long time. And we've been focused on adding talent, developing talent for quite a while. So I do not think we're tapped out organizationally on what we can take on. As Nick said, we would probably wait a little while to bite off another Esterline size acquisition if that came along today. But the general course of business flow, we continue to stay in the acquisition market and believe we're not tapped out on bandwidth. It really has a lot to do with the way we integrate businesses, and our decentralized control allows us to have more bandwidth to take on acquisitions.","Myles Walton","And just one clarification, the size of your aftermarket for defense versus OE defense at this point, is what relatively?","Kevin Stein","We don\u2019t comment on the individual pieces. Do we?","Nick Howley","They are about the same, but we don\u2019t comment on the exact match to that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Stallard","Nick or Kevin, the big debt issuance you did last week, and one of the rating agencies downgraded your debt rating as a result of that. Is was wondering if you could comment what their beef was with this situation, whether this might have an impact on the cost of debt going forward?","Nick Howley","Mike, you might. I don\u2019t think they downgraded\u2026","Mike Lisman","I think the corporate rating remain B one B plus with negative outlook from each.","Nick Howley","And they almost always get when you're going to do a big issue and they hold the rating. They almost always give a negative outlook, which says, we're going to evaluate as we go forward. [Multiple Speakers]\u2026","Robert Stallard ","And then on the defense side, you also have very good result in the first quarter, and you commented that the bookings were also strong. I was wondering if you could maybe characterize and what you think is driving that. Is it more shorter cycle demand that's coming through, which makes you a little bit reticent to raise the guidance to the year? Or is this something that's probably longer term more visible that could have like?","Kevin Stein","I think the defense aftermarket business is following to your shorter-term horizon bucket. We are seeing stronger performance there in terms of bookings growth. I think we're looking at the guidance. As I said in the prepared comments, one quarter it's hard to develop a trend from that, need to see some more data points to evaluate the market segments. Certainly, it's encouraging so far and maybe we're just being conservative.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Ken Herbert","Either Kevin or Nick, I just wanted to see if you can provide a little more detail on the commercial aftermarket. I mean you highlighted that broadly you had very strong bookings across the business. And I think you said commercial aftermarket bookings up over 20%. But you also commented, Kevin, that you really didn't see any meaningful change, I guess across the businesses with the strength that continued here. On the commercial aftermarket, in particular, can you just remind us again how much of that business would you estimate is total book and ship? And then maybe what else would you like to see there to get a little bit more comfortable with perhaps upside to the full year guidance in terms of that market?","Kevin Stein","I think look what I would say is we're just being cautious. We're one quarter in and would like to see some more. The bookings were strong in the quarter, as we commented up 20%. I did commented maybe some of the freight fundamentals were not as strong. We've seen some, going forward, maybe that that will ease a bit in growth in the future maybe. I was just trying to provide some color for the future that it may not be as rosy as the bookings might indicate. The interiors market discretionary interiors, a little softer start to the year but that's anticipated to come back strong in the second half. So I think we feel comfortable with our mid-to-high single-digits guidance around the commercial aftermarket segment. If we continue to see strong bookings, the bulk of which are still book and ship in the quarter, then we will look to evaluate that in the future but one quarter does not a trend make yet.","Nick Howley","I think just a couple things. One, we don\u2019t need to indicate any negative view on that, just that we're always wary when the fundamental -- the underlying demand still looks good, looks about the same it did the beginning of year. We like to see more than one or two -- one data point before we change trend.","Ken Herbert","Specifically, on the freighter markets, I know 2018 was a really big year for conversions and I know some of the freight traffic seems to have been slowing on the margin. I think it probably was a pretty good year for you last year. Can you just quantify maybe how much you think that could be down this year? And I know it\u2019s not a big piece of the business overall. But is that a material headwind that we should really watch that could soften? Or how should we think about freighter markets in particular?","Kevin Stein","It isn\u2019t, yes. I see the same fundamentals that you see and FTKs cooling, slowing down maybe some concerns about the macroeconomic trade environment. I don't know. So I'm just cautious there that I was -- I think we're all surprised that freight was as strong as it was in the quarter. Just commenting that that's strength may not continue. But I don\u2019t have any indication to say that it is cooling except the fundamentals of the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our following question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Strauss","So I guess Nick or Kevin, I thought with the announcement with when you announced Esterline that you were considering using some of the cash on the balance sheet. What made you decide to finance the entire deal? Was it the M&A pipeline that you see out there, was it just solely the attractiveness of the capital markets and where you could do the deal?","Nick Howley","I think David we were pretty vague about how we would finance when we announced it. I think what we said is we had a fair amount of cash. And I don\u2019t think we went much further than that. I think the credit markets looked quite good to us. And we don\u2019t have anything specific on the horizon just credit markets look good to us. It looks like they are very attractive source of capital. So we've decided to go a little bigger.","David Strauss","Kirkhill, how is that progressing?","Kevin Stein","Kirkhill continues to perform well. We've seen some improvements since ownership. We don\u2019t comment on the margins or the individual details. But we've seen gradual improvement there as we plan. So I think Nick or I, we both talked about Kirkhill was a nice lab experiment for Esterline and it continues to perform well. So we're happy with what we've got there and the way it's performing.","David Strauss","And last one the Esterline, the intangible amortization that you would expect to run through your adjusted numbers. Do you have an estimate for that at this point?","Mike Lisman","I think you probably looked at the pro forma financials that were filed with the bond documents, and it's $20 million and that could change as we work through the final accounting.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter Keay","Just question or comment, I think you said OE business jet and helos, the top line growth of over 20% but you said it was hard to sustain that. But you also said bookings were up over 20%. Did I hear that correctly and can you just flush that out a little bit more please?","Nick Howley","Yes, let me read the exact quote here back, just so I'm not confusing myself. I said business jet and helicopter OEM revenues make up 20%. Revenues in this combined market were up over 20% compared to same period. Bookings in the submarket outpaced sales in total with strong business jet bookings but weaker helicopter bookings. So that's what I said that. What was the question again above\u2026","Hunter Keay","Well, I think you also noted some questions around the sustainability of that growth rate. I'm just trying to tie that to the booking commentary you gave as well?","Nick Howley","Well, we see strong bookings there largely, or they are in the business jet sector and its large-format cabins mostly, that's what we're seeing. We're seeing some slowness in orders on the helicopter side. The bookings are strong, sales are up but we do see some weakness there. Again, I'm trying to comment, provide a little color on the fundamentals of the business jet. We do see growing OEM demand, large form factor, of course. But we just look for the stability in the market and the takeoff, and landing cycles has not been robust. We're not seeing a tremendous amount of growth there, so we're cautious. And I'm just trying to highlight much like in the freight markets some caution around the future.","Hunter Keay","And then question for Mike. I'm just curious to hear your personal views on leverage, how they've evolved maybe over the course of your career before you got to TransDigm? And how your time at TransDigm has maybe evolved, your own views on balance sheet, maintenance and leverage? Thanks.","Mike Lisman","My background is in the private equity industry. So I think I am more familiar with seeing companies that operate at TransDigm site leverage ratios. And I think going forward as we've shared with you guys previously, we intend to continue to keep relatively high leverage ratios relative to the rest of our A&D peers. But I don\u2019t think my thinking or background has evolved a ton overtime it hasn't changed a ton since coming to TransDigm either.","Nick Howley","Obviously, Mike's significant background in private equity was a very attractive attribute to us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Ciarmoli","Nick or Kevin, just I could understand and appreciate the conservatism, especially in some of the shorter cycle markets. But you had the real strong commercial OE growth in the current quarter. I mean, I would think just given the rate increases, the visibility there, you'd have a little bit more comfort in that market channel, maybe A380 aside. But anything that you're seeing in the OE side of the market that would give you reason for pause on the commercial side?","Kevin Stein","No, nothing is giving us pause. We are just the same concerns about raising guidance, one data point does not align make. So if it continues this way and we see future quarters, we would look to revise. But right now, yes, maybe it's just conservative but we're leaving it as is for right now.","Michael Ciarmoli","And then just on the overall revenue front. Organic growth, I know it's seems, maybe two years ago, there was speculation you guys couldn\u2019t really grow organically anymore. And here you put up one of the best organic growth rates in quite some time. Can you give any color what really drove that volume versus price? I mean, did you see volume material volume increases in all markets, or was there more price in certain markets? Any color if you could parse out that growth? Just it was such a good rate that we haven't really seen in quite some time?","Kevin Stein","I think it's important in this business to recognize that revenues can at times be lumpy. They can be really strong and unexpectedly strong at times one quarter to the next. It's a lumpy business. It has to do with managing of inventories and the supply chain and other factors. So we again want to be appropriately conservative in the way we look at this. Not seeing concerns in the future but just want to be appropriately conservative without getting ourselves ahead.","Michael Ciarmoli ","Was there anything in the quarter, I mean any big chunky deliveries or positives\u2026","Kevin Stein","No, actually there weren\u2019t any. On the OEM side, commercial OEM, we did see a return of wide bodies that we have seen some related softness to last year. I think I was a little surprised that the amount of narrow-body orders that came in as well. So I think orders and sales are both pointing to better wide-body of narrow-body performance.","Nick Howley","I think in the overall, the fundamental market conditions, so you might -- we thought they were a year ago. And as Kevin says, we're always careful that one data point doesn\u2019t make a line. ","Michael Ciarmoli","Nick, just one last one on Esterline, you probably going to punt on this, but I'll try and ask. Can you give us a sense of what you guys might be targeting for cost synergies? I mean, just knowing the Esterline model, knowing that you had Kirkhill as the lab experiment. I mean, do you have a ballpark synergy target just on the cost side of what you realistically think you can immediately take out of that business?","Nick Howley","I'd like the comment on it, except they snapped the ball over my head. So I can't. I think we've given you as much guidance as we can on that. We told you we expect the private equity like return based on the certain capital structure that we've given you is an assumption. And I think that's about the most specificity I can give.","Operator","Thank you. Our following question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Gautam Khanna ","I wanted to ask just if you could comment on the interiors market within the commercial aerospace aftermarket, and if you are seeing any change in trend there positive or negative?","Kevin Stein","On the discretionary interiors, that's our Schneller and Pexco business. We have seen the year begin a little slower than we have liked or than we anticipated. But the order book for the second half of the year seems to indicate that that will be a transient softness. So, we're anticipating the interiors will recover and perform well for the year.","Gautam Khanna ","And Nick maybe just for you, if you could talk about what level of leverage would you actually be comfortable taking the balance sheet up to in this type of credit and economic environment for the right transaction recognizing\u2026","Nick Howley","Yes, I just don\u2019t want to comment on that. I think you've seen a number of year history of our leverage. If I was trying to figure out what we're going to do, that's probably not a bad idea to look at what the history has been and I think that's around where we feel comfortable. But I wouldn't want to comment on what we might do if the situation was right. On some interim basis, we have no plans right now. But I'm very reticent to comment on what you are doing in capital market conditions before it exists.","Gautam Khanna ","I hear you. I guess what I'm asking is generally you feel pretty strong about the macro, it seems like [Multiple Speakers] about the macro and the health of the aero market and like\u2026","Nick Howley","We don\u2019t have any unique insight other than anybody else does. We see all the -- we saw all the market data and we know what our numbers look like. And we still feel pretty good, I get it that we're late in the cycle. But we try to be pretty consistent in the way we run the businesses and the way we capitalize on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Kevin and Nick, you talked about a few organizational changes and promotions just going back to Myles's questions a bit more. Can you give us how you are going to tackle this deal versus other deals just given the relative size? Any qualitative color would be helpful.","Kevin Stein","I actually don\u2019t think we're going approach it really all that different. We are going to have a focused team to work on it. We're putting some dedicated resources on it. But we're going to use the same integration playbook that we always use. And so we have some resources to apply to it, both in finance as you heard, there is obviously other folks that were able to dedicate to the Esterline integration team, senior group controllers and like that they will help round out the team. We've been I think planning for something significant for a while and putting resources in place, stretching folks, getting our EVPs ready. We have another wave of potential folks ready depending on what's needed. So the succession planning and people development as a way of business is really what we've been working on for a very long time. So I don't feel -- I'm not as concerned on the resource side. And I think we will have the people to put on the Esterline integration team to make it successful.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And then just one follow-up on commercial aftermarket. I know it could be lumpy and you guys have tough comps last year, but just looking at the passenger side of the business. It seems that have grown at about 6% rate. You look at your air traffic, it's that great. So it's growing slightly below that if you exclude price. Any color you could give what you saw in this quarter on maybe repairs versus ad-hoc or replacement business?","Kevin Stein","I don\u2019t have a lot of additional color to offer on that. It tends to come out in time. I think the repair and overhaul market has been solid for us. You're directionally correct in your passenger segments of the commercial transport, it was a strong quarter for us and we continue to see good opportunity, both on MRO, repairs, overhaul and spare parts. The outside, the look through sales for the distribution sales, the POS for them remains very strong as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is now open.","Peter Arment","Kevin, maybe just a quick one for you given all this growth that you're seeing. Are you seeing any stretch out in lead times that was in the supply chain or anything that is a watch item for you? Just given the strength that you mentioned across all your end market? Thanks.","Kevin Stein","We have seen some limited supply hiccups. Generally speaking, we tried to cover that with inventory buffers and our own work in progress to ensure that we can survive that. But we've seen some limited I don't want to say that we've seen none of that. I think it's isolated to a few areas, mostly around chemical processing, outside processing, not fundamental across the business. So we've seen a little bit of that but so far we're handling it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open.","Jason Rodgers","What is the pro forma net leverage ratio, including Esterline?","Mike Lisman","As of 3\/31, it's going to pick-up slightly to just over 6 times. But obviously that assumes no kind of cash payout or anything, just to put footnote that.","Jason Rodgers","The next question was, are you planning on providing updated guidance once the acquisition closes or are you planning on waiting this quarter?","Mike Lisman","Once the acquisition closes, we will update our guidance and assumptions.","Nick Howley","Well, I think I've said, once the acquisition closes and we feel comfortable with it. I wouldn\u2019t expect something the day after we close.","Jason Rodgers","And then finally, as far as your fiscal '19 forecast not including Esterline. What is the organic growth rate and tariff impacts you have embedded in that guidance?","Mike Lisman","We don\u2019t have any tariff impact in our guidance at all. And so far we haven't seen anything significant.","Nick Howley","And I just don\u2019t think I know what [Multiple Speakers] at the beginning of the year, all within our long-term guidance here [Multiple Speakers] we gave at the beginning of the year plus the bump.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Q - Seth Seifman","I was wondering if you could talk, you guys have always managed cost pretty tightly. Margins were very impressive in the quarter. Were there any headcount actions or specific cost actions you took in either the September or December quarter that supported the profitability in the quarter?","Kevin Stein","No, nothing other than our normal approach to driving productivity on a daily basis, daily, weekly, monthly, it's a constant process, other than our normal approach, nothing specific that we can call out. So we're always looking to drive productivity and contain costs across our businesses.","Seth Seifman","And then just a follow-up on that real quick. To what extent did you view the strong growth in commercial OE that becoming a bigger part of the mix as a headwind for profitability that needed to be overcome in the quarter to put up the margins you did? Or was that not really an issue?","Kevin Stein","That was not an issue. I did not know that ahead of time that we would have such strong OE, and you'd have to overcome that. There was no special one-timers in the quarter that helped our profitability. So yes, there was none of that commercial OE helped deliver what it did. We saw the increases on the defense side. And on the defense aftermarket side those are all contributed, including commercial OE to our profitability.","Seth Seifman","And it is still fair to think that commercial OE has fairly well below average margin?","Kevin Stein","That's right, yes. And it also takes more headcount. So there's a lot of volume there. The commercial OE side of the house, we have to watch that closely.","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Nick, just coming back to your comments on getting close to wrapping up the IG audit. Is there any ongoing impact associated with that? You talked about the $16 million voluntary fund, I'm assuming that's onetime in nature. So just trying to get a sense of any pricing concessions going forward, any changes is business practice that you have to assume, such that it may impact margins or revenues. I think you know what I'm getting at\u2026","Nick Howley","Yes, you're right. It would be a onetime. And we're not suggesting we concur with that, by the way just to be clear. And we don\u2019t know if any impact going forward. I'll just repeat, there is no allegations of any illegality or wrongdoing, or anything like that.","Rajeev Lalwani","And then Kevin, just maybe for you, in terms of just your dialog with the OEMs over maybe the last couple of quarters. Has there been maybe a change in tone in terms of how they are trying to work with you, specifically pushing more royalties on some of your revenues? Any color you can provide will be great?","Kevin Stein","Yes, we have not seen any change in approach from OEMs asking for anything different than the approach that we always see. Nothing new.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Liza Sabol for any closing remarks.","Liza Sabol","Thank you. That concludes our all for today and we'd like to thank you all for calling in this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

My name is Steve, and I'll be the operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Liza Sabol, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2015 third quarter earnings conference call. With me on the call this morning are TransDigm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nick Howley; Chief Financial Officer, Terry Paradie; Chief Operating Officer of our Power Group, Kevin Stein; and our Executive Vice President, Greg Rufus.","A replay of today's broadcast will be available for two weeks, and details are contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com.","Before we begin, we would like to remind you that the statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC and are available through our Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.","The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for calling in. Today, I'll review our consistent business strategy. I'll give a short update on our recently completed acquisitions as well as some information on the recently announced PneuDraulics deal. I'll review the financial performance and market summary for Q3 and year-to-date for fiscal year 2015. And I'll discuss our revised guidance for fiscal year 2015.","To repeat, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle.","To summarize why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary engineered products, around three-quarters of our sales come from products for which, we believe, we are the sole source provider, over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales, and aftermarket revenues have historically produced higher gross margins and provided relative stability in downturns. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has year-in and year-out generated very strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structure flexibility.","We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven value-based operating strategy based around our three value driver concept, that is, steady cost reduction, profitable new business and value-based pricing. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system with executives and senior managers who think, act and are paid like owners. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as another means to create shareholder value.","To remind you, we basically have four alternatives for capital allocation, and our priorities are consistently as follows. First is to invest in our existing businesses. Second is to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. And these two are almost always our first choices. Our third is to give extra money back to our shareholders, either through a special dividend or a stock buyback. And our fourth alternative is to pay off debt. Given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions.","Now, with respect to financial capacity, we have about $915 million in cash, roughly $535 million in undrawn revolver and additional capacity under our credit agreement. After raising an additional $925 million in May, we ended the quarter with a net leverage of six times EBITDA, well below our credit agreement limit.","At 6\/27\/2015, based on current capital market conditions and after all our recently announced financing and M&A activity, including PneuDraulics, we believe we still have adequate capacity to make about $1.5 billion of additional acquisitions without having to issue any equities. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for the balance of the year.","As you know, we recently closed on three transactions, Telair cargo handling business for about $730 million, and that was at the end of Q2, the Franke aerospace faucet business for $75 million at the beginning of Q3 and Pexco for $496 million during Q3.","Though it's too early to know with certainty, so far all three acquisitions are performing at or above our expectation. The integrations are proceeding well. We have seen nothing so far that makes us question either the quality of the businesses or our value creation thesis. And in other words, we still think these are good deals. As with all our acquisitions, we expect to generate private equity-like returns from these transactions.","Now additionally, we recently announced the execution of an agreement to acquire PneuDraulics for $325 million. This includes approximately $107 million of tax benefits spread evenly over the next 15 years. We don't own this company yet, but we believe it will be a strong addition to our portfolio of companies. The company manufactures proprietary aerospace valves and actuators; it has about 275 non-union employees, all in Southern California. The company's revenues are about 85% commercial aerospace, with the balance military aerospace. The company's products are used on all major Boeing platforms, including the 787, as well as on the Airbus A320 and the new Airbus A350 family. The products are on all major regional jets and turboprops. They have substantial positions in the biz jet world on the Gulfstream, Cessna and Canadair family of business jets. Almost all the revenues are proprietary and mostly sole-source. The aftermarket makes up about 35% of their revenues.","Also in Q3, we closed on new financing of about $925 million, about $575 million of which was used to pay for Pexco and Franke acquisitions, and the balance is in the cash on our balance sheet. We also extended the maturities on about $1.1 million of our existing debt and lowered our overall interest rate a little bit. Currently, about 75% of our debt is fixed, swapped or capped. For the next four years to five years, we are reasonably well hedged against large swings in interest rate. As an example, given our current structure, a dramatic 8% increase in the LIBOR rate, far above what anyone is anticipating or expecting, would only move our after-tax interest rate about 1.25%.","Now, turning to our Q3 fiscal year 2015 performance, and I remind you this is the third quarter, our year started October 1. And I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in OEM-aftermarket mix, large orders, inventory fluctuations in the system, modest seasonality and other factors. The total GAAP revenues were up 13% versus the prior year Q3 and up 10% on a year-to-date basis. Organic revenue was up about 3% on a quarter-versus-prior-quarter and year-to-date basis. Commercial year-to-date bookings are running modestly ahead of revenues in commercial OEM and aftermarket segments. Defense bookings are up significantly over revenues.","I remind you that due to cut-offs in timing, as we mentioned last quarter, Q3 only includes two months of Telair and Franke. Q4 will have four months of these businesses.","Reviewing the revenue by market category on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q3 and the prior year-to-date, and this is on slide five, this now includes the recent acquisitions of Telair, Franke and Pexco. Pro forma, to remind you, means we assume we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up \u2013 1% versus the prior year Q3 and 5% on a year-to-date basis. This is primarily driven by commercial transport shipments, which are up 6% on a year-to-date basis and a little over 1% for the quarter. Our business jet OEM revenues were up modestly in Q3 versus prior-year Q3. Though small in dollars, the commercial helicopter shipments continue to decrease. On a year-to-date basis, commercial OEM bookings continue modestly ahead of revenues.","Total commercial aftermarket revenues, commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 3% versus the prior-year Q3 on tough comps and up about 5% on a year-to-date basis. Sequentially, Q3 revenues were up 5% versus Q2. On both a Q3 and year-to-date basis, the commercial transport segment was up a little more than this average, but this was offset by slower growth in bizjet and general aviation and declines in commercial helicopters.","The commercial aftermarket growth by operating unit showed no clear picture. Our businesses were all over the map here. Year-to-date commercial aftermarket bookings are running slightly ahead of revenues. The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenues, defense revenues were up 9% versus the prior-year third quarter and 8% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, the largest contributors to the growth are A400 shipments at Telair, parachute shipments at Airborne and C-130 shipments at AeroControlex after a prior-year inventory drawdown at Lockheed on the C-130. Bookings continue to run well ahead of revenues on both a quarter and year-to-date basis. We could see some full-year revenue upside here.","Moving to profitability and on a reported basis now, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance, or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q3 were primarily made up of financing related expenses, non-cash compensation and acquisition-related costs and amortization.","Our EBITDA As Defined is about $313 million for Q3. This is up 13.5% versus the prior Q3. Year-to-date, on the same basis, is $871 million or up about 11.5% versus the prior year. The EBITDA As Defined Margin was about 45% of revenues in the quarter and almost 46% year-to-date. This is roughly flat from prior-year Q3 and up 1% from prior-year year-to-date in spite of the addition of the lower margin acquisitions in the numbers.","The Q3 and year-to-date EBITDA margins, without dilution from the impact of the acquisitions purchased in 2015, that is Telair, Pexco and Franke, was approximately 47%. We expect this core group of businesses to also be at roughly 47% for the full year.","I remind you, the core group I just defined now includes the lower margin Airborne and EME businesses. If we also excluded these two 2014 acquisitions, the core should be about 49% EBITDA margin on a full year basis.","With respect to acquisitions, we've been busy, as I've discussed. We continue looking at opportunities. We still see a reasonable amount of activity, but the closings are always difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on value creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.","Now moving on to the guidance. We're adjusting our total company guidance upward to reflect primarily our Pexco acquisition and a more favorable tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expenses. As usual, our guidance does not include any additional acquisitions other than Telair, Franke and Pexco. It does not include PneuDraulics since we have not closed on that yet.","Our revised guidance for the total company as is follows. Revenue guidance is now $2.7 billion to the midpoint, up about $24 million versus the prior midpoint. Our EBITDA As Adjusted guidance is now $1.22 billion, again to the midpoint, up about $15 million versus the prior. EPS as adjusted guidance is $8.71 to the midpoint; this is up $0.09 versus the prior midpoint. Of the increase in adjusted EPS of $0.09 at the midpoint, as I said before, the most significant contributor is from the Pexco acquisition with most of the balance due to a more favorable tax rate. These are offset in part by the higher interest expense from our recent borrowing.","By market segments, we are using the following assumptions in our guidance: Commercial OEM, mid single-digit growth, this is unchanged from prior guidance; commercial aftermarket, mid-single growth, this is unchanged from our prior guidance, but could be a little tight; defense, mid-single growth, as you can see we're stuck on mid-single growth here, but this is up modestly from our prior guidance and we may have some upside here.","All in all, a good quarter. Our operating results were strong. We closed on two solid acquisitions and we expect PneuDraulics will close soon. Assuming PneuDraulics closes, we will have invested about $1.6 billion in high-quality aero businesses with strong value generation prospects over about a 180-day period. It's been a busy few quarters.","And with that, I'm going to pass this on to Terry Paradie, our new CFO, for his first at-bat with TransDigm.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. I'm very happy to be here and, hopefully over time, I can hit the ball as well as Greg has over past.","So before we discuss the operating results for the quarter, as Nick mentioned, we borrowed an incremental $925 million in the current quarter, primarily to pay for acquisitions, and refinanced approximately $1.1 billion of our senior secured debt to extend maturities, lower our interest rates and increase our liquidity.","In addition, I want to remind you that the prior period also included refinancing activity in June 2014 to mainly pay a $25 per share dividend and refinance $1.6 billion of existing notes at lower interest rates. Both of these events impacted several line items significantly in the quarter and prior quarter comparisons, especially refinancing costs that occurred in both periods. This quarter included $18 million of refinancing costs versus $131 million in the prior-year period. With that in mind, let's turn to our quarterly financial results.","Third quarter net sales were approximately $691 million, up $81 million or approximately 13% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions, Telair, Pexco and Franke, contributed $64 million of the additional sales for the period. Our organic sales were approximately 3% higher than last year, primarily driven by growth in defense, offset by lower growth rates in commercial OEM and aftermarket.","Our third quarter gross profit was $359 million, or 52% of sales. Our reported gross profit margin of 52% was 1.6 margin points lower than prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of almost 2.5 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior-year quarter improved almost 1 margin point due to the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure.","Our SG&A expenses were 11.8% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.7% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, non-cash stock comp expense and other non-operating expenses, SG&A was about 10% of sales compared to 10.4% of sales a year ago.","We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $19 million or 22% versus the prior-year quarter. This is a result of an increase on our weighted average total debt to $7.9 billion in the current quarter versus $6.3 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to both of the refinancings previously discussed. Our weighted average cash interest rate at the end of the quarter is approximately 5.1%. Including the new incremental debt, we now expect our full year fiscal 2015 net interest expense to be approximately $420 million.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.6% compared to 22.5% in the prior year. We now expect our effective tax rate including discrete items for the full fiscal year to be below 31%, which is lower than we estimated last quarter due primarily to additional benefits from foreign tax credits. We now expect cash taxes to be $150 million for the year.","Our net income for the quarter increased $83 million or 513% to $99 million, which is 14% of sales. This compares to net income of $16 million or 3% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales and lower refinancing cost versus the prior period. These items were partially offset with the higher interest expense previously discussed.","GAAP EPS was $1.75 per share in the current quarter compared to a loss per share of $1.66 last year. The prior-period loss was due to the inclusion of $111 million or $1.94 per share of dividend equivalent payments paid in the prior quarter primarily related to the $25 per share dividend that we did not have in the current year quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $2.26 per share, an increase of 12% compared to $2.02 per share last year.","Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP to adjusted EPS.","Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $915 million of cash on the balance sheet. This includes approximately $350 million of proceeds from the refinancing we put on the balance sheet to use for general corporate purposes after paying for the acquisitions of Pexco and Franke and refinancing our senior secured debt and related fees during the quarter. The company's net debt leverage ratio was 6 times our pro forma EBITDA As Defined. Excluding any acquisition in the previously-announced PneuDraulics acquisition, we now expect our cash balance to be just over $1 billion and net leverage to be approximately 5.7 times at the end of fiscal 2015.","With regards to our guidance, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $7.53. And, as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $8.71. The GAAP guidance midpoint was lowered to the additional interest and refinancing costs in the quarter. The $1.18 of adjustments to bridge GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.06 from the dividend equivalent payments, $0.22 from refinancing cost, $0.41 from non-cash stock option expense, and $0.49 of acquisition-related expenses and other. Our full year depreciation and amortization, including backlog, is now expected to total approximately $98 million.","Now, I'll hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terry. In order to give everyone the opportunity to ask questions, I'd ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. If you've further questions, please re-insert yourself back into the queue. Operator, we are now ready to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Stand by from your first question, which comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, Nick, if you're able to answer this, it would be very helpful, but do you have the organic growth in your EBITDA As Defined in the quarter. I think you did 13% total, but do you have the organic equivalent to that?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","About half of that is organic.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. I don't know the exact number, but I...","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","About 6.5% of it.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Okay. You hear that, about half.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Okay, that's good. And then a question \u2013 a high-level question, Nick, on commercial aftermarket. I think when you parsed it out, the air transport sounded a little better than it looked.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, not a lot. I don't want to be \u2013 it's the lion's share, so it can't be way different.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Well. So, at the risk of just treading right into the heart of the matter, I think aftermarket's confused or confounded people over the past couple of weeks as it has all year, it's come in softer than we thought it might, especially given what traffic is supposedly doing. And I'm wondering if you can shed some light on how we have \u2013 I understand it was a tougher comp and so on, but how we have aftermarket trending at like half of RPMs?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No. I get that, Rob, and I must admit it's a little baffling to us too. And we look at everything and read everybody else's numbers as they come out. So I don't think we're unique in this. I don't honestly, Rob, I \u2013 other than airlines aren't buying as much (27:17) or some mix of inventory drawdown or deferrals of some discretionary items, I don't know that I can give you any other particular insight into it.","I will say, if you look across our operating units, it isn't a clear picture. They're sort of all over the map. It isn't that discretionary ones are up and nondiscretionary are down or vice versa. It's just not a clear picture and frankly it's lower than we expected.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Well, I mean, are we seeing just a real sea change in the way airlines think about aftermarket and overhauls and that this is just a new disciplined world? I guess, the U.S. airlines are driving this and maybe it spreads and that they're just figuring out how to work just in time or something that's a little bit more permanent rather than a soft patch?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","The real is, I don't know, obviously. I would say on the fundamental demand, like use of our product, there isn't any change. So to the extent that there is inventory adjustments going on and rippling around the place, it would seem to me that that should settle out eventually. Though honestly, it has been more volatile for the last three years, four years than I would have expected.","If I look back, Rob, over any extended period of time, two years, three years, four years, it seems to kind of all cancel itself out as you average that out and the numbers still look about what you expect. But I will admit it's bouncing around more than I would have expected.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just a clarification on your comment \u2013 I think it was yours, Nick; maybe it was yours, Terry. On the debt and rates, if I understood you correctly, you threw out a very large 8% increase in, did you say, LIBOR?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I did. I said that.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And you're talking about 800 basis points, I want to make sure I understand what 8% increase?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","8% increase. Rob, I would say that is, I'm only trying to show how much \u2013 how well we're hedged against that. I have no reason to believe rates are going to go up 8%.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, again, 8%...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Essentially, LIBOR today is zero.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Right. Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And what I was trying to say is, if it went from effectively zero \u2013 I think it's 0.2% or 0.3%...","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","0.19% (29:48)","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","If it went from that up to 8%, a far greater move than anyone anticipates or anything like that over the next four years or five years, our after-tax rate would move about 1.25% or 1.5%, I forget...","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, 1.25%","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","1.25%. And the pre-tax would be a little higher than that. I was just trying to give you a sense that we think we've gotten ourselves reasonably well hedged here for the next four years or five years.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just to tie the loop and put some math to that, that would be going from, I think, a blended rate right now of like 5% and change, 5.3% up to about 6.5%?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't have the calculation in front of me. Well, yes...","Unknown Speaker","That's after ...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well now we're getting pre-tax in it \u2013 this is again an 8% \u2013 I want to be clear to everybody.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Well, 5.3% pre-tax and 6.5% is pre-tax. And when you do the math in the tax, when we're done, it's about $1.30 clip to earnings \u2013 if it happened.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, I'm not sure how you're doing the math.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Rob, I've lost track of the math. Remember, all the debt doesn't move with LIBOR.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, fair enough. But I was applying the new interest rate to all of the debt based on the way you phrased it.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, Rob, Maybe we can take this...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","...one offline. We'll do the math with you.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Half of that is fixed.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Remember that.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. So essentially, you can think of it as half is fixed, and half can move with the LIBOR, but we've significantly hedged half of that.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Right.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So I don't think I'm following your numbers and I don't want to try and parse them out on the fly.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. It just...","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, I was applying the new rate to the whole thing. And if that's wrong, we'll just do it offline.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think Nick used 1.25%, but on a pre-tax basis the interest rate, if it went up to 8%, LIBOR increased to 8%, it was about a 2% impact pre-tax to our interest rate.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So I don't know if that helps.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And again, Rob, I want to be clear, I am not suggesting that we anticipate an 8% increase in LIBOR.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, you're trying to show that you're fairly resilient here if it starts to move...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","...to move against you. I fully appreciate that. That's why I wanted to have the discussion online...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","...and take it the full distance. Okay. Thanks, Nick.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Hey, Carter.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was going to go with a financial riddle, but my head's spinning now, so we'll skip that one. Nick, two questions for you. The first is, obviously you closed or announced a lot of deals in the last 180 days, I guess, you put it. We've seen these waves in the past at points in the cycle that I think most industry observers would call late, and as we get sellers who are sort of eager to not hang on too long and sell before the risk of a downturn kind of come to pass. Is there any of that driving the uptick in the number of transactions you've announced or is this just sheer coincidence that you've come across four of them that really seem to fit the power alley of what you're looking for out there?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean that's hard. It's always hard to speculate on why someone's selling. I wouldn't surprise me if it contributes somewhat to it. I mean, if you just run back through them, we bought one from AAR. They were going through \u2013 they're going through a fair amount of restructuring. Whether the market cycle is the precipitating event, I think they were going through the restructuring anyway. It's hard for me to tell exactly why the timing was. I think the Franke one is pretty well something we've been working for a while and I think that just kind of hit when it hit. Pexco is a PE sale. And so I think a PE seller surely doesn't want to try and sell something right at the top of the cycle and they don't want to risk getting stuck having to hold for three years or four years. So I suspect that's a contributor on that one. And PneuDraulics is a family business and it's always hard to sort out the politics or rationale for a family sale. But I can't imagine the fact that the cycle's pretty good was a negative on their thought process.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. I guess what it gets at is just are you seeing more motivation, I guess, among sellers and is this a trend we should look to continue or is the pipeline as it's been for the past couple of years, I guess is the way I'd ask it.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It surely seems more active to me, but I don't know how that predicts and we surely have not bought a bunch here in the last, whatever it is, 150 days or 180 days. I'm quite comfortable, Carter, we're not going keep that pace up.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. And just to follow up on cash flow. I know, for at least one of these transactions, you said you were going to go through a facility relocation. Now that you've done a couple of them, I'm not sure what all the aggregate plans are, but just wondering if there's an inventory build of significance associated with facility rationalization.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't think these were any \u2013 I don't know what percent most of you use in your model for working capital, by which I mean receivables inventory, receivables inventory amounts payables 25%, 27%, 28% something like that. I don't think there's anything that'll move it outside of that range. A little, but I don't think materially I don't think anything that shows or makes any impact on the model.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","On the cash flow, great.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, sorry.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you, gentlemen, and welcome Terry.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick, maybe just back to the overall aftermarket, we saw some suppliers get caught off guard with 787 provisioning. Have you seen any changes in 787 provisioning, how are you sort of baking that into the model going forward? And also how are you thinking about the A350 provisioning as that starts to happen?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We tend to not plan on much provisioning for our products. And when it comes along, we sort of look at it as a \u2013 I was going to say the bird flew over and got us on the head, but I'll say a nice hurricane, a nice upswing, because our experience has been one, our products aren't hugely amenable to provisioning, amenable is maybe the wrong word, but they tend to not provision big quantities of it. And we've also found it to be very unpredictable, so we tend to not count on it. And you know what you're all really is doing is you're pulling shipments forward that you would get eventually out in another year or two, and we'll probably look at, Mike, we'll probably look at the A350 the same way.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I wouldn't count on much. And we may get some, but we wouldn't count on it.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just you guys used to break down sort of your revenue exposure by platform. I mean just getting back to Rob's question around aftermarket growing half of RPMs. Are you guys seeing notable changes when you maybe slice up the data by the older generation of platforms, 757, 767s, 747s? Is that creating the headwind or do you guys not have that visibility?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I can't answer that. But I just don't know the answer, Mike. Not that I'm not willing to answer it, I just don't know the answer. I would say we are pretty well market-weighted with all the group of parts and businesses we have. And I can't say it's been obvious to us the one class of airframe has been disproportionately either buying or not buying versus what we would have expected. That's my general impression just from business reviews and things like that, but I can't give you an exact number.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Okay, perfect. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, Nick, I just wanted to follow up on the original equipment side of the business. And I'm just curious, in prior calls you've provided detail on sort of your step-up in content on major platforms and if I go back to the Investor Day last year, when you gave some specifics around the 787, A350 et cetera. I'm just curious organically in two acquisitions. Are you able to provide any sort of refresh on maybe specifically for the 787 or the new narrow-bodies or the A350? Are you still capturing content organically and maybe what some of the recent acquisitions do to some of your exposure by some of these major programs just purely on a relative basis as you've talked about it in the past?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Liza, don't we once a year update in our website in our formal presentation the top 10 platforms and the next 10 platforms and the like?","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","We did. It doesn't have all the acquisitions.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Doesn't have all the acquisitions in it. Yeah. I would say, in general, and I can't recall each one of the every acquisition, but our content on the new platforms continues to improve. The 787, Pexco is a big supplier on the 787, it's a big part of their program and the content substantially stepped up. At Telair, the A350, they have the cargo handling system, which is a big cargo handling system for them.","Whom I'm missing? Franke is relatively small, but \u2013 so it's not going to move it much. But in general, we think we are continuing to move up. We know that if you look at on a pro forma basis that same-store basis, we know our content is moving up on the \u2013 is up significantly on the 787 and the A350 \u2013 by pro forma I mean same-store basis.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","And organic -","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And if we didn't make it same-store that's \u2013 I mean same-store and organic is the same. And if you didn't \u2013 if you did it on a GAAP basis, it's going up very substantively.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's helpful.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","And then if I could on the defense market, it sounds like obviously your \u2013 you had maybe a little upside, your mid single-digit or it sounds like if there is any opportunity to maybe outperform on the guidance it's in that market. Can you just provide a little bit more color on where you're seeing the bookings and the strength and if there is maybe any near-term risk to the subside or it sounds like it continues to surprise to the upside? But anymore detail on the defense markets would be helpful.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I think I gave you \u2013 I gave you some detail on it. It is \u2013 I don't think there is near-term \u2013 much near-term risk, by near-term, I mean the balance of the year here. I mean that's stuff pretty well locked and loaded at this point in the year. The upside has been a relatively few programs. It's been a relatively few programs. If you pull them out, the rest of the businesses are flattish. But it's been the A400 shipments and I think we told primarily Telair. I think we told you and we bought that, they were going to be way up which is one of the reasons we expected maybe a little flattening in that next year.","The parachute shipments both personnel and cargo, mostly outside the United States and our Airborne business have been just exploding this year. And the other is the C-130, we have a fair amount of content on that, particularly in the cargo handling at our AeroControlex and CEF businesses. And Lockheed last year had been drawing the inventory down, primarily because they've build inventory for a higher rate and drew it down substantively last year and this year are now behind back up to the rate, which has a \u2013 means a year-over-year it's a significant step up. So those are the three big drivers of it.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. So, ex those three you say, it sounds like you're running flat?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I'd say you are modestly up, modestly down, flattish kind of number across all the rest of the business as an aggregate.","Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Well, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Nick, just to carryon on the aftermarket trend here. Have you seen any change in your pricing strategy impacts in the quarter and have you seen any impact in terms of regional trends because of foreign exchange?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we surely have seen foreign exchange adjustments, but we price in dollars and we have not changed our pricing history pattern strategy, et cetera at all.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. And the foreign exchange impacts have been pretty minor for us for the quarter.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Have you seen any airlines maybe buying fewer spares, because of the foreign exchange pressures that they are dealing with?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, we surely have seen some buying fewer spares obviously. If you see across the industry, I don't know that I can attribute it to that, I surely haven't heard anyone say that.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Then, Terry, just a couple of quick ones for you. Can you reconfirm the interest guidance, I missed that? And also how does the PneuDraulics tax impact flow through over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. So the interest guidance for the full year this year was $420 million and what we'll have, from a PneuDraulics standpoint is we will get a tax benefit of just over $100 million taken over the next 15 years, that won't impact the rate, it will impact our cash taxes. So from a GAAP standpoint, the tax rate will be sort of our normal effective rate, which right now is around 32%. We've lowered it for this year down to 31% because of discrete items but our normal rate's around 32% going forward.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much.","Terrance M.

Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co.

Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Can you hear me better now?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Last June and September, you had very strong aftermarket sales growth and was there anything looking back by region or by product that made the compare much tougher this time around? I mean, was there any geography that stood out when you looked back, and so maybe on a year-on-year basis that would explain some difference?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Not that is obvious to me. It could be, but I don't recall it and I don't know the answer to that question, is the real answer. I would say the big spike ups in those two quarters came after probably a two or three quarter period where there was very low growth. Once again, that we and everybody in the industry were trying to figure out what was happening and then all of sudden we get two huge quarters of orders, which looks like what was happening was people were deferring and drawing maintenance down.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right. And could you remind us with Franke and Telair and Pexco, how quickly \u2013 or what contractual barriers there may be to your value-based pricing strategy coming into play? I mean, is it going to be a several quarter kind of ramp or how should we think about the phase-in there?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I think Pexco will move relatively quickly. I think Franke will move relatively quickly though it's pretty small. Telair, I think we gave you some guidance on that, that one will move more slowly.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And last one, if you could just comment on the amortization we should anticipate going forward on a quarterly run rate basis?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. We said for the full year around $91 million. So, I'm assuming it would be probably in that $20 million to $25 million a quarter going forward \u2013 excuse me, $98 million,","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","$98 million.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","... excuse me, $98 million.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","$98 million...","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's including backlog.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Including backlog.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You'll get it in our guidance actually...","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And that does include depreciation, you've got depreciation and amortization.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, depreciation, amortization and including backlog at $98 million for the full year. So, you can probably model $25 a quarter.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And the actual amortization of intangibles?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That's all of it.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's all of it. Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please go ahead.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Nick, I might have missed it but did you give what order activity looked like for the aftermarket in the quarter?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I did not. I said that it was running slightly ahead year-to-date. And I would say for the quarter, it was roughly flat. The orders were roughly flat. By orders I mean bookings quarter-to-quarter sequentially.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","But I would say \u2013 I'm trying to figure out this big jumble of numbers here sitting in front of me. The \u2013 yeah, up some over the previous Q3.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","So up a little bit year-over-year and flat sequentially?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, flat sequentially and up a little bit yeah, year-over-year in the quarter.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. The acquisitions, the couple you've completed here and the one still to go, how should we think about the margin potential of those businesses? I know the past couple of acquisitions you've done prior to this you talked about there wasn't a chance to get kind of the TransDigm average but how should we think about these recent acquisitions?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't know where \u2013 let me run back through them, I'm not sure where we're starting with recent, but let's say the ones over the last 100 maybe days, which I presume that's what you mean, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Franke, I think a very good possibility. Pexco, I think very good possibility. Telair, probably not all the way there, but \u2013 for a number of reasons, but good growth but not \u2013 the margins won't get all the way there, I don't think. And PneuDraulics, since we don't own it, I'd rather not talk about it yet.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And going back to the aftermarket volume versus price. I mean, is it right to think about it, Nick, based on, looks like about 5%, 5-or-so percent pro forma aftermarket growth for the year that volumes have been relatively flat?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. We don't disclose the price, but it sure isn't very robust growth.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","And I think you got it pretty well.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And, Terry, you talked about cash taxes, it looks like this year you're going to be kind of in the 20% cash tax range with the cash benefits \u2013 tax benefits from these two deals. Is that the right way to think about cash taxes going forward, probably in the 20% or so range beyond this year?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not sure. We'd like to forecast \u2013 give you that guidance out next year. What we have done is changed our guidance for this year down from last quarter. And the main reason for that is being driven by the timing of actually getting our refund from \u2013 we just filed our tax return. We expected it'd take a lot longer than we had planned in the forecast last quarter and we actually received it already and that makes up half the \u2013 approximately half the change from last quarter this year in cash taxes. We also had the foreign tax credit which we weren't expecting help reduce cash taxes and then the rate probably makes up a difference.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Another question on the aftermarket and maybe the answer to this question is obvious just looking at the words. But I just want to clarify, when you say proprietary and sole source, for each of those, does that mean that there is zero chance for competition from, let's say, retired aircraft or parts coming out of the secondary market or PMA or any alternative sources?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, there is proprietary and sole source that somewhat could clearly chop up an old airplane, take the part out, fix it up, and try and resell it. We don't see much of that, we don't believe primarily because the price points of what our parts tend to be, they tend to be lower than the food chain in pricing and usually not 100%, but usually not worth that. PMA activity is \u2013 I don't believe has changed much. It's quite modest. It's a very, very low percent of a penetration in our aftermarket, well down in the single-digits, and I don't think it's changed much over the last six years, seven years, eight years or 10 years.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up. I know we're probably a little early here to talk about next year. But if you roll up all your end markets and you think about a typical year with kind of typical economic growth, maybe it's 4% or 5% organic growth, and I think that's probably the assumption that you have based in your kind of return calculation. Is there any reason to think at this point that 2016 should be any different than that?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I just don't want get into speculating on 2016 yet. We'll give the guidance when we give it. And we hate to sort of paint ourselves in corners.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understand. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","How're you doing?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm doing well. How are you, Nick?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Fine.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","On the $24 million change at the midpoints of the revenue outlook, is that just purely what Pexco gives you in 4.5 months of contributing or is there some negative offset to that?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","I don't \u2013 it is primarily Pexco. How many months that we have them?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It would be 4.5 months.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","4.5 months. There may be some offset, Noah, but it's not significant.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Because if I just reverse engineer that \u2013 I mean, I don't know, I guess...?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You're not dividing by 4.5 months, all right, because that's far too complicated for us.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What's that?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","You're not going to divide by 4.5 multiplied times 12, right, because that's far too complicated for us.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, I know, I mean, if you do that, I mean, I guess, it \u2013 maybe you could walk us through how it works with taking the tax benefit out of the purchase price. Because if I do take that number and apply it to \u2013 or make it a monthly number and multiply it by 12, it would imply you paid a pretty high revenue multiple for the business?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, I guess, that depends how you adjust for the tax benefit, right?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So how should I do that?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","That depends how you adjust it for the tax benefit, I think.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. I mean, I'd just \u2013 so if I just take the 4.5 months...","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","One sort of discount rate. And I know, Noah, you guys are investment bankers and you know a lot about discount rate.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So is it fair to say you didn't pay a substantially different multiple than your historical range for this year?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yes, when you adjust for the \u2013 make whatever adjustment you want to make for the tax benefit by however you want to discount that, the way we end up, we know we did not. We did not pay a significantly unusual. We do not pay particularly high multiple for it. We paid what we generally pay.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the $24 million is almost entirely Pexco, maybe some rounding somewhere else?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, everybody is waving their hands at me now. There's some other round and some other things in there.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Are you specifically saying that you do see airlines destocking inventory right now for any specific reason or are you more just saying that what have to be the logical conclusion given...?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, we'd have to value deferrals of things \u2013 or the logical conclusion to me. I cannot \u2013 Noah, as you know, it's always tough to get us particular partner, particular group of airlines and say how many parts did you have last quarter and how many you got this quarter.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","It's more \u2013 I'm drawing logical conclusion.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I mean, if you do aggregate that globally, you can see in the first quarter that inventory has actually declined, so the trend line seem lower. I guess, I was hoping to ask you guys why, but it sounds like it's a bit of a mystery.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah, it is. And the answer is I don't know. But I look across almost what everyone's reporting and I see the same thing.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Okay. And then, would you be willing to quantify what you expect the tax rate to be in the fourth quarter?","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","No, I think what we've guided to the full year tax rate just under 31%, you can use that as your full year estimate and that's our guidance at this point in time.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Terrance M. Paradie - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys.","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a quick follow-on to maybe other couple of questions that were asked before. But kind of broadly speaking, Nick, some of the more recent acquisitions that you've made have had a higher OE content versus aftermarket content. How do you think about that and how do you think about that in terms of just the portfolio programs you're on and just broadly when you think about doing M&A?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Well, our rule is always the same. We're looking for proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket. Now, we don't stick a stake in the ground and say exactly what significant means, but it has to be a meaningful part of the business and, more importantly, a meaningful part of the EBITDA that we think we can move.","Our EBITDA content is somewhere around little over 50% now. I'd say most of the businesses we have bought have been in that range, or businesses that are somewhere in that range where we think we have a chance of getting them somewhere in that range.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Okay. And then maybe just one, change gears just a little bit, and these questions aren't coming up quite as frequently, but just curious. How has the Partnering for Success program at Boeing played out for you guys at this point?","Nick Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.","So far fine. As you know, it's \u2013 this question has been asked before, we have the confidentiality agreement, so I can't talk about the details of it. But as I've also said that we're very value-driven. If we didn't think it was either even or somewhat value-accretive, we wouldn't do it.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Liza for closing remarks.","Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.","Thank you, again, for participating in today's call and please look for our 10-Q that we expect to file some time tomorrow.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you very much and have a very good day."]}}
