At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Clark","Good morning, and welcome to Regency\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.","I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements.","On today\u2019s call we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Before turning the call over to Hap, I would like to thank those of you who participated in our Investor Perception Study. We are grateful for your candor and appreciate the feedback. Hap?","Hap Stein","Thanks Laura. Good morning everyone. In our evolving business we continue to see the rise of retailers that have identified what it takes to remain relevant and evolved in the fall of those that have not. ","As we all know, Sears was once a successful brand, but in the ebb and flow of the retail industry their declining performance over the last decade, further hindered by excessive debt illustrates how critical it is for retailers to keep the pulse of consumer preferences and expectations. ","Sears failure, along with the success of numerous winning retailers also demonstrates the importance of having the capital to invest in the betterment of store, customer service and experience, as well as a technology platform that supports multi-channel retailing. ","The best in class retailers including Amazon, Whole Foods, Kroger, Target, Publix and TJX just to name a few continue to make sizeable investments in the bricks and mortar footprints. Based upon our many conversations that we\u2019ve had with key retailers, it is clear the physical stores remain a very critical component of a multi-channel strategy. This is really apparent in how retailers are investing in the physical footprints and providing a seamless and differentiated shopping experience to meet the evolving needs of their customers. ","Kroger is not only enhancing their technology and delivery platform, but investing in their store with a restocked Kroger initiative, which focuses on customer experience, value and talent development. ","Safeway Albertsons while partnering with Instacart and rolling out Drive-up is also remerchandising 400 of their stores. Publix continues to heavily invest in both new and existing locations with plans to redevelop over 130 stores this year as part of their $1.5 billion capital plan. ","Publix has also demonstrated a real point of differentiation with their commitment to exceptional customer service. Going above and beyond offering aid in communities that were impacted by recent catastrophic storms is yet another example of the many ways that grocers are able to effectively connect to their shoppers and communities. ","Target has expressed their commitment to bricks and mortar and indicated that the store is the central part of their strategy. They plan to remodel all stores by 2020; continue to open their very successful small format store and are investing in their team, as well as pickup and delivery service. ","In addition, Amazon has announced an aggressive rollout of bricks and mortar locations and this is in addition to the large investment in Whole Foods. These and other best-in-class retailers are benefiting from the proactive investments and producing solid results. ","Publix reported strong comparable sales and generated an impressive nearly $1 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the year. TJX\u2019s comparable store sales rose 6% last quarter and Target reported their large quarterly sales growth in 13 years. ","Our well-conceived and well-merchandised shopping centers located in trade areas with substantial purchasing power appeal to these and other outstanding retailers and restaurants. Regency\u2019s proven strategy which our team has successfully executed with astute capital allocation and intense asset management has been distinguished by sector leading NOI growth over the last six years. ","We do spend a significant amount of time ensuring that Regency is staying relevant and employing our unequal strategic advantages to achieve our objectives. First, earning a high quality portfolio that sustains sector leading same property in our growth; second, creating substantial value to our national development and redevelopment platform; third, maintaining a very conservative balance sheet; and fourth, engaging a team that is best in the shopping center business is guided by Regency\u2019s special culture and operators efficiently with industry leading systems. ","And finally, earnings and dividend growth and in turn total shareholder return that is consistently at or near the top of the shopping center sector. JT?","Jim Thompson ","Thanks Hap. Core fundamentals within Regency\u2019s premier portfolio remain extremely healthy. As Hap said, retailers continue to see value in locating a higher quality shopping centers and staying close to their customers. This is evident as occupancy climbed to nearly 96% this quarter. ","Move-outs were the lowest they've been in two years and bad debt remains very healthy. The strong fundamentals across our portfolio translated into another solid quarter of same property NOI growth, driven by base rent growth of 3.8%. ","As I noted on our prior call, rent spreads in any given quarter can vary based on the mix of leasing. This quarter we executed on several opportunities to bring valuable anchor spaces to market resulting in new rent spreads at 35% and total rent spreads of 10%. ","I'd like to take a moment and highlight our shop space performance that clearly demonstrates the quality and resilience of our portfolio. Our shop space percent leased has been 92% plus for the last six quarters. We're seeing demand for space across all categories from many thriving tenants. ","We've been successful, executing increases in starting rents, and in addition our achieving contractual rent steps for shop space that average 2.5% while judiciously managing capital commitments. All leading to strong, net effective rent growth for the last five years. ","I'd like to touch on recent retailer bankruptcies before turning it over to Mac and I\u2019ll start with a Toys \"R\" Us update. Of the five locations originally in the portfolio, one of the locations was released and the centers been sold. One location was assumed by another retailer at auction where we experienced zero downtime. One has been released as already commenced and the remaining two locations that we most recently acquired at auction, we're in active negotiations with a specialty grocer and a fitness user.","Next, we have 25 mattress firm locations in our portfolio. Only five of these leases have been formally rejected at this time. Most importantly, we are confident that with the quality of our real-estate we will have the opportunity to upgrade merchandising as we back fill any closures.","And finally Sears, where we have two Kmart\u2019s and one Sears location. Two of these locations were included on the initial closure list, both of which are redevelopment opportunities that we are excited to finally unlock. All three are located in grocery anchored shopping centers where grocery sales average over $950 per square foot, demonstrating the draw of our real-estate, as well as the opportunity and our ability to substantially upgrade the anchor. Average rents on these locations are less than $8 per square foot. ","While these bankruptcies will certainly impact near term results, more importantly the remerchandising and redevelopment opportunities triggered by recapturing this real-estate will positively impact our shopping centers over the long term. Mac. ","Mac Chandler ","Thank you, Jim. The healthy fundamentals we are experiencing in our operating portfolio are also evident in our investment activity. We continue to find compelling ways to astutely investor capital and go book our new development and redevelopment pipeline.","Our in process development and redevelopment projects are performing very well with strong leasing interest and economics in line with underwriting. For example, this quarter our Mellody Farm development in Greater Chicago celebrated its grand opening with all five acres, including Whole Foods, RAI and Nordstrom Max open for business. All have reported impressive sales exceeding expectations. ","In regards to our pipeline, we continue to make progress on our development and redevelopment opportunities and are positioned to achieve our five year goal of $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion in starts and deliveries. Our local teams are pursuing new opportunities in our target markets, including L.A., D.C. and Houston. ","We are also making meaningful progress on our pipeline at infill redevelopment. We are especially excited to start the redevelopment of the office building at Market Common Clarendon and The Abbot in Cambridge which should start in Q4 and Q1 respectively. ","Further, our entitlements are progressing positively in Bethesda, which should allow our Westwood Shopping Center redevelopment to commence next year. And while we are in the early stages from a timing standpoint, we are making great strides to unlock the value creation opportunities at several premiere properties such as Costa Verde in San Diego, Town and Country in Los Angeles and Piedmont Peachtree in Atlanta's preeminent Buckhead market. ","These larger scale pipeline opportunities and others, especially those that are mixed use but non-retail components take tremendous discipline, expertise and persistence. Proudly, our platform possesses these qualities and as we\u2019ve said in the past, if we side to co-invest in a compelling non-retail component that will complement our retail, we will only partner with best-in-class world capitalized developers. ","Moreover we continue to unlock value through redevelopments that are more technical in nature. This is a focus where we have enjoyed great success over the years and is an integral part of a pro-active asset management and fresh look merchandising and place making philosophy. Current examples include Bloomingdale Square, a $19 million redevelopment started this quarter where we are relocating and expanding the Publix into a former Walmart space and adding Home Centric and LA Fitness to the shopping center. ","At Gateway at Aventura, we proactively acquired the former Toys \u201cR\u201d Us box at auction and are now in anchor negotiations to greatly enhance the value and drawing power of this excellent property. Lastly, at Point 50 in Fairfax Virginia, we are completely repositioning the center by building a new Whole Foods 365, as well as several new shop buildings. ","Now turning to transactions. Similar to last quarter, there is a limited availability of institutional grade shopping centers on the market. Demand and pricing for these high quality centers continues to be strong. ","On the selling side, the momentum we reported last quarter is coming to fruition. The buyers for these centers that we are selling are still discerning. The market has improved as that market debt solidified and deals are getting done. We have more visibility into expected sales volume for late 2018 and early 2019 and have accordingly increased our disposition guidance. The upward revision to our disposition cap rate is a reflection of the pool of properties we expect to close and not a change in pricing expectations. ","As a reminder, our strategy is to sell approximately 1% to 2% of our asset base annually. We invest these proceeds along with free cash flow into value add developments and redevelopments, high growth acquisitions or our own stock when pricing is compelling. ","This quarter we co-invested in Ridgewood Shopping Center located inside Raleigh\u2019s belt line and anchored by the highly productive Whole Foods. This center had been owned by the same family for nearly 70 years and our local presence and deed market knowledge give us an inside track to acquire our 14th shopping center in the Raleigh market. Lisa? ","Lisa Palmer","Thank you Mac and good morning everyone. As Jim stated, we had another solid quarter as our high quality portfolio continues to perform. Year-to-date same property NOI of 3.8% has been driven entirely by very strong growth. But as we mentioned on our prior call and as our full year guidance indicates, while we are still projecting strong baseline growth in the fourth quarter, we do expect a deceleration in overall same property NOI grow, as this strong base line growth will be offset by three main drivers. ","First as expected, our real-estate tax reassessments in California triggered by our merger with Equity One has started to come in and are retroactive to the date of acquisition. So essentially this equates, it actually is two years of real-estate tax expense. While the vast majority of real-estate taxes are recoverable from our tenants, we will experience a drag from the non-recoverable portion of these reassessments. ","Next, we're are also up against a tough comp in base rent from redevelopments that came online in the fourth quarter of last year, specifically from too much larger projects, Fairmount and Aventura. And lastly as Jim discussed, the recent retailer bankruptcies will create opportunity to remerchandise and reposition our real-estate in the future; these will have near term impacts. ","So although the timing related to the Sears bankruptcy could moderately swing us one way or the other, we have incorporated reasonable assumptions on their move out dates into our of revised 2018, same priority NOI growth guidance of plus or minus 3.25%. ","Turning to earnings, both NAREIT FFO and operating FFO for the full year were revised upward by a penny at the low end, incorporating slightly better performance in same property NOI. ","Before we turn the call over for questions and reminding you that we won't provide formal guidance for 2019 until early next year, I still would like to give you some insight into our same property NOI growth expectations as we do look to next year. ","Let me start with a reminder of our road map to our same property NOI growth objective. First, embedded in the portfolio is 1.3% growth coming from contractual rent increases. Then another 1% to 1.2% comes from new and renewal leasing rent spreads. Combined these provide about 2.5% growth. ","Finally the contribution from redevelopments is expected to add another 50 to 100 basis points of annual growth. Together, absent any changes in rent paying occupancy, these components equate to our strategic objective of 3% plus, average annual, same property NOI growth. ","However our initial look into 2019 includes a couple of short term impacts to this roadmap. First, while timing is still very uncertain, the downtime associated with our three Sears boxes could impact same property NOI growth by up to 50 basis points. ","Next, the redevelopment contribution has been and will continue to be uneven at times. Over the past 5 years, including year-to-date 2018, the annual contribution has ranged from 40 basis points to 170 basis points, averaging at 75 basis points positive contributions, thus the 50 to 100 basis points range in our roadmap. ","In 2019 the contribution is expected to be minimal as NOI is taken offline at some of our larger, more transformational redevelopment projects. So while the contribution from redevelopments to our NOI growth can be uneven and I want to reiterate that we still remain extremely excited about our expanding pipeline and the contribution to growth that will come in 2020 and beyond. ","For the difficult to predict Sears bankruptcy and the atypical contribution for redevelopment is likely to result in a more muted 2019 same property NOI growth in the low to mid 2% range. That said, there is much more to come as we close out the year before issuing formal guidance. But most importantly given our very high quality portfolio and our active REIT development pipeline, we continue to expect our same property NOI growth to return to 3% or greater over the long term. ","We're extremely pleased with our results this quarter, and the position of our high quality portfolio and fortress balance sheet, all of which support our ability to grow earnings and dividends, which in turn expect total shareholder return to be consistently at or near the top of the shopping center sector. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. We now welcome your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from a line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. ","Greg McGinniss","Hey, good morning. This is Greg McGinniss with Nick. I was just hoping you could provide some details on those new anchor lease signings. I was just trying to understand if this is a repeatable situation. Of those 88 new leases how much were actually above that 35% mark. ","Jim Thompson","Greg, I'm not sure I can bifurcates that 40, but bottom line in that we had strong anchor growth of 85%, really driven by Publix and LA Fitness in our Bloomingdale redevelopment; those where the real leaders. As I said in my opening statement, the mix on a quarter-to-quarter basis is hard to predict and hard to try to analyze or bifurcate, but overall we're really excited. 12.7% of that new growth rent was in shop space, so the combination of 35% is really kind of across the board. ","On the renewal side I will say that we were somewhat muted on a very large target at Serramonte renewal which was flat. So overall we are happy with the rent growth and [inaudible]. ","[Cross Talk] ","Hap Stein","You know the trial package we\u2019ve indicated in the past, we\u2019re going to have \u2013 Greg we\u2019re going to have a number of legacy leases that will repeat the benefit we received from the publics in LA Fitness leases and other leases that JT just mentioned. It won\u2019t be all of the time, but over time we\u2019re going to see more of that than less of that. ","Greg McGinniss","Okay great, I appreciate the insight there and then you know I appreciate the details on the same store NOI growth guidance as well, but I\u2019m just trying to understand a bit more here. So 3Q came in stronger than originally expected, so I\u2019m just curious what changed their. You know this was the full reason that guidance was raised and if any of that impact that you were expecting is part of what got pushed into 2019. ","Lisa Palmer","Primarily it is the reason why one, that we raised the low end of our earnings guidance and additionally took off the low end of our same property NOI guidance. It's just a matter of \u2013 as you know and as we all know, the most difficult thing to predict are move outs and we always incorporate a reason of what we believe it to be, a reasonable assumption and that came in better than expected for the quarter, so we had fewer move outs than we anticipated. ","Greg McGinniss","Okay, great. Thank you very much. ","Hap Stein","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. ","Christy McElroy ","Hi, good morning everyone. Lisa just following up on the \u2013 again the topic of the same store NOI into 2019, just with regards to the California reassessment, the portion of that that's one time, are we looking at another three more quarters of drag there to the recovery rates? And then in terms of the redevelopment just to clarify, are you talking about to inherit in the low to mid 2% range, is that zero contribution or is that a drag from redevelopment? ","Lisa Palmer","First, the real estate tax reassessments, we would expect that just the fourth quarter should be the last of the one-time impact and next year as in any typical year, as in other states where properties are reassessed at you know certain intervals, we are expecting potentially up like a 5% increase in real estate taxes next year. But remember that we do recover about 90% of that. So it would be a minimal bleed for that. So the recovery rate going forward for all recoveries we would expect is right about where we are year-to-date assuming no change in occupancy, so in the 82% to 83% range. ","And then with regards to redevelopment contribution for next year, again it's pretty early as you know and we need to have a little bit more visibility as to when leases come online and as we finish projects, so I don't know that we can give you any specifics and we will do that in early next year, but would expect it to be you know somewhere in the zero to 50% range of the positive contributions. ","Christy McElroy ","Okay, and then just with regards to the accounting change, the $0.06 to $0.07 moving into G&A in 2019, I understand that that also includes the leasing costs that previously would have been capitalized into the basis of your in-process development projects. How much of the estimated $0.06 to $0.07 would have been attributed to sort of normal recurring CapEx versus sort of that development, redevelopment bucket. Just geographically thinking from a modeling perspective you know just where that would have found through. ","Lisa Palmer","Christy I\u2019m not sure I understood. So you are asking how much of our internal leasing costs are \u2013 because the $0.06 to $0.07 is [Cross Talk]","Christy McElroy ","No, no, no. Just with regard to the $0.06 to $0.07. Yeah, just splitting out the $0.06 to $0.07, what has this gone through, recurring CapEx versus what would have been through development, redevelopment spend, the leasing costs, because it would have been, it would have shown up in your development schedule right, in the total cost attributed to each development project. So I'm wondering if that gets adjusted? ","Lisa Palmer","It's still \u2013 in our disclosure when we give leasing capitalization costs, it\u2019s still our \u2013 we\u2019ll have to get offline on that, we\u2019ll come back to you.","Christy McElroy ","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Craig Schmidt ","Oh! Thank you. On the three boxes from Sears holding, does Regency have control over these boxes? ","A - Hap Stein","Craig, at this point we do not. All we know is we have two boxes that were on the initial 142 store closure list. We've not heard any more than that. ","We obviously have been awaiting this day for a long time. Our teams have been focused on redevelopment plans. We feel like we're in great shape and eager to recover our real states, so that we can move forward and enhance our centers by back filling these tired old Sears and Kmart boxes with dynamic retailers today. So we\u2019re \u2013 and more to come obviously, but no news other than its showing up on the closure list and we are prepared when it comes back to take those two. ","Mac Chandler","In addition as Jim indicated earlier in the prepared remarks, the inbound comments and interest in the space has been very, very encouraging. ","Craig Schmidt ","And is there a broader acreage of land that comes with the stores? ","Hap Stein","In the Sears specific we have a tire, battery, auto and probably some excess parking area that we believe we can probably do some patch \/ out billings on. So beyond the box we think there's some external redevelopment opportunity as well. ","Craig Schmidt ","Okay, and was October rent paid on these boxes? ","Hap Stein","Yes. ","Craig Schmidt ","Great! Okay, thank you. ","Hap Stein","Thanks Craig.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Derek Johnston","Hi, good morning. We've discussed a real estate tax assessments and how it relates to the EQI portfolio, but in relation to the prop 13 bill in California, can you give us an update on the weighted average age of the Legacy Regency assets there? Have you begun to assess that potential impact? ","Lisa Palmer","Yes, and it is just the Legacy Regency obviously as essentially those that are being reassessed at ages zero if you will. So of the remaining which is about 20% of our asset base, its 13 years. ","Derek Johnston","Thanks, and just switching over to the omni-channel repositioning that you discussed at the beginning, what effort and the roles of the local strip banker grocers are you seeing? Which are best positioned to address online delivery, online pick up growth segments and you know what actual investments are you seeing on the ground and what can you guys do to expedite the adoption? ","Hap Stein","We\u2019re facilitating the adoption of the pick-up and delivery and we're seeing a keen focus on the part of pretty much all of the grocers. I think the key thing, and that's all important; technology is important in the store and we\u2019re all investing heavily in that, but it's also the shopping experience and the service that\u2019s really the point of differentiation and I think that's critically important to remember and keep that in mind, and that's the reason why you know we think that our grocer sales are as high as they are, both on an aggregate basis of $32.5 million and $650 per square foot. ","Derek Johnston","Great, thanks. ","Hap Stein","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Jeremy Metz with BMO. Please proceed with your question. ","Jeremy Metz","Hey, good morning. Going back to the Sears and Kmart topic, assuming you can get control of those boxes, do any of those represent an opportunity to kick off bigger densifications of those sites just given how big this year's in Kmart boxes presumably were and then it sounds like you more or less have been ready for this as most have been. So any rough capital investment that this could potentially represent? ","Jim Thompson","Jeremy, to answer the first question. We studied the densification and believe our best avenue today is to replace with like retail. So the justification, I think we\u2019ll be just higher better use, better quality retail. And I'm sorry, what was the second?","Jeremy Metz","About capital. You certainly [cross talk] \u2026","Jim Thompson","Capital, it's really too early. We\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 as Hap indicated we got a lot of answers from a lot of different players and until we can spend some more time and really understand when we are going to get back and those kind of things, we're really not positioned today to talk about it. Well, obviously we continue to target the 7% to 9% when we get our hands back on our redevelopment, that's kind of our goal.","Lisa Palmer","Yeah, I think just to add a little bit of color Jim, in two of the three that are Kmart boxes. They're not Sears boxes, so they're just typical legacy Kmart\u2019s and there's a reason they\u2019re still, because it's really strong real estate and we do believe that will be an opportunity to upgrade the merchandising and then potentially also grow NOIs. ","Hap Stein","The K are extremely excited about the opportunity. ","Jeremy Metz","Yeah, I know that's fair. A question for Mac, in terms of acquisitions, the Ridgewood Center that you did enter by Whole Foods, was this sourced by your partner or why not put that one on balance sheet. Just given that it seems like down the fairway for Regency and I guess sticking with acquisitions, one of your peers mentioned the move-in rates causing some sellers to pull back. I know you guys have been active, but maybe you can talk about what you're seeing and hearing out there from an acquisition standpoint. ","Jim Thompson","Sure thing, Jeremy. You're right that Ridgewood is right down the alley for us. It\u2019s a terrific center and we look forward to working with Whole Foods as their lease doesn\u2019t expire sometime in the next 10 years. Our partner was that we acquired the property with actually had some internal recycling, so they were selling a center that we owned with them and this was part of their internal capital recycling. So they were up and the rotation worked within that and that's the reason for that.","In terms of just overall perception, buyers are closing and we mentioned it this last quarter. There's just a firmer fitting underground for sellers; debt markets were cooperating and it seems like the market has come up and we noticed that in the transactions we closed today and we have another $60 million under contract with scheduled closings by year-end and another $65 million where we\u2019re negotiating purchase agreements, but in those cases buyers have already begun their due diligence. ","So they may not all close, but we\u2019ll have some to grow to next year and some could drop out, but we are seeing you know buyers feeling you know measurably better about things than they were six months ago and we're seeing that in the transaction market. ","Jeremy Metz","Yeah, so I guess I was also trying to wonder just from an acquisition standpoint, as you\u2019re out there your seeing, not you guys, but other sellers in the market pull back a little bit here or has there been any change in the cadence of deals that are out there that you are seeing? ","Hap Stein","I think what makes it hard to measure is there is very little property of the caliber that we're looking for that's on the market and we\u2019ve seen very, very few transactions out there. So you know there are definitely institutional buyers and advisors who are out there looking for a Class A product that we are a product that has a strong tenure CAGR, but unfortunately there's a pretty select few properties out there that are transacting because buyers \u2013 owners are reluctant to put their properties in the market because it's hard to find a replacement property; there's so little Class A in the market.","Jeremy Metz","Okay, fair enough. Last one from me. Hap you mentioned the importance of investing in the store and the customer experience. You know as you think about your increasing role in that, the landlord needing to play a bigger part in creating that overall environment, are you committing more capital are looking to commit more capital along this front which may not necessarily be able to immediately \u2013 it should be returned to the longer term, you know it's going to benefit the center and therefore your ability to both retain and source new tenants as you need. ","Hap Stein","Well, number one, as part of our \u2013 obviously our large scale redevelopments and even our tactical redevelopments, there our fresh look philosophy where there's a tremendous emphasis on merchandising and on place making, they're going to distinguish the look of listing the state appeal of those shopping centers to the communities and neighborhoods that they serve, so I think that\u2019s important. But we\u2019ve got an ongoing maintenance program and in that ongoing maintenance program we're very focused on you know place making and ongoing leasing and merchant and merchandising is critical to that. ","So that\u2019s a part of the way we do our business each and every day and we feel really good about the way our shopping centers are distinguishing and they are continuing to focus on how to keep them relevant and we are also \u2013 I think our view is we spent between 10% and 11% of NOI from a tenant improvement White Box ongoing business, you know building improvement standpoint and think that that number is still good and together with the redevelopments that are tactical in nature will keep our shopping centers looking fresh and relevant to our communities. ","Jeremy Metz","Thanks for the time. ","Hap Stein","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. ","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. So you have an interesting dynamic that's going on in your department pipeline. You might have about $280 million of pipeline, but if I look at the percent leased and think about the dollars at risk, there\u2019s really not much because a lot of it has been leased pretty well. ","It kind of clears up your pipeline or your development capability for next year. You also mentioned a lot of these other bigger projects in your opening remarks. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much do you think you will start next year?","Mac Chandler ","Sure, I\u2019m happy to take that. This is Mac. While we haven\u2019t given formal guidance yet on our developments starts for next year, and we will be doing that in the near future, but you are right. The developments that we have that are underway are performing very well. At 80% leased where we are very happy with those and it allows us to use our expertise to work on some of these longer term redevelopments and I touched upon several of those in our opening remarks, I\u2019ll just give an example. ","Westwood Shopping Center which is a center they came over with Equity One, in about a year's time we should be ready to start that project and that is very promising. It's a mixed use project, with retail. It's got approximately 200 apartments and some tenants to it and these are complicated projects and not every company is capable of doing this, but we think we have the team and the expertise and the market knowledge to take this on. ","So we are bullish about that. We\u2019ll eventually give guidance on where we think we\u2019ll be, but over a long term, which is really the right way to measure our contribution, it\u2019s not a year-to-year business, it\u2019s always going to be lumpy, but we think we are on track to hit our five year target at $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion in starts and then deliveries would come with that two as well. So hopefully that answers your question. ","Ki Bin Kim","Yeah, I mean it does. I mean I think about Bethesda project. That by itself is probably very sizeable. You guys started about $200 million this year. I mean I guess just directionally it does feel like it could be a lot more in the next year. So is that \u2013 am I thinking about it correctly?","Mac Chandler ","Well, I think directionally you will see us doing more of redevelopments as a percentage of our total investment than we have in the years past. In some years it was more ground up as compared to redevelopments and I thinks switching and more agnostic to the two. In fact we like the flexibility optionality that redevelopments give us and so I wouldn\u2019t associate more, but I would say the mix between ground-up and redevelopment is shifting more towards redevelopment and we are very pleased with that. ","These are properties that we one and then Town & Country is for the one, new one to that and we are coming into a partnership on that property which is a terrific property located across the street from The Grove and we mentioned that before. But that allows us to bring our expertise to enter into a family partnership and to add some density to that and ultimately that will be one of our more key properties across the country. We are very pleased with that. ","Ki Bin Kim","Okay and just last question. For the last question, on the Sears, Kmart I realize you don't have much direct exposure, but how do you think about that tangential exposure just from the model shop supply that might hit the market and how that impacts your portfolio?","Hap Stein","In general, space is space and it has an impact. But we think and we feel real good about our locations, about our anchor tenants, about the team\u2019s focus and you know we have released virtually all the space that\u2019s coming back to us, the anchor space that has and I think that\u2019s indicative to say it doesn't have any impact. But we believe that as Lisa said that we can generate in fact 2.5% from an underlying NOI growth standpoint before redevelopments and we think over time that redevelopments are going to contribute an additional 50 to 100 basis points. ","We've got the team in place, the commitment, only to say in regard to the redevelopments, you know it's kind of become the topic de jure and this has been an integral part of our business historically and we got to the team placed and the markets to markets these projects happen. ","As Mac said, they can be complicated, they can be difficult, and we\u2019ve not even viewed the tactical ones. I think as I indicated earlier, it\u2019s just an opportunity to refill a box, etc. It\u2019s an opportunity to further distinguish of our shopping centers for the long term. And just to reiterate what Mac said I think we're very well positioned to achieve the $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion of development starts and to average as Lisa said, 3% same property NOI growth, even in a market where there is going to be additional store closings. ","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Hey, good morning everyone. I want to maybe just go back to the properties that you're buying and selling. Maybe we can talk about the properties you're selling first. Could you provide any more color as to what\u2019s maybe making those less attractive and trade at lighter cap rates. Is it location, is it you know the type of grocery store there, is there alternative mix. What is making that less attractive to you or maybe you want to work into something that's so called higher quality. ","Mac Chandler ","Yeah, sure thing Rich. This is Mac. You know if you just look at page 15 of our supplemental, you can start to pick up some teams here from the set of properties. It\u2019s a [inaudible] anchor. It\u2019s a deals anchored center; it\u2019s a theater anchored center. ","There\u2019s two larger projects that are really big box centers. There is one in India, its unanchored, its shadow anchored by Home Depot, so it\u2019s not the typical Class A infill grocery anchored tenants that we own and we feel that these properties were ready to be sold. These were prioritized disposition for us, and ready to solid and were widely marketed and they cleared. ","It\u2019s a type of center that I mentioned, sort of the tenants who are there, but it\u2019s also the location. These are smaller markets, and if you plug into the demographics, they are lighter than our typical property. They are on the low end and they are typically lower growth and people are paying for growth. So all those characteristics contribute to the pricing and we feel that the pricing was correct. These are really out buyers in many ways. ","Rich Hill","Got it, and so it looks your rising sales have been fairly similar this year, at least in terms of number. But you also mentioned it\u2019s hard to find the high quality properties that you want to own. Do you think there is more role quality properties to go for you to sell or as you just mentioned, is it really just an outlier. I guess what I'm asking, do you think there's more opportunities to see more portfolio location at this point in time or is it becoming harder just they may as well be higher quality properties. ","Hap Stein","Yeah, being able to find good use of the capital is an issue. Being able to do transactions on a tax efficient basis is also important, but the other key thing is we don't have to sell properties. We are in a position where those properties that kind of have the characteristics that Mac just described are the remaining less than 5% of our portfolio, so we are in a position to sell when it makes sense to sell and when we have the appropriate use of funds and we can do it on a tax efficient basis. ","Rich Hill","Got it, and just one more follow-up question if I will. Are there any examples where you can take out so called 79 property and put money into it and make it a 49 property? I mean does that exist or is that just not a use of your funds in your opinion.","Hap Stein","That\u2019s \u2013 where we can we have an opportunity to do that, we do that each and every day. That's a key part of our business and we've been doing that for years and these redevelopments represent a lot of those when we are transforming the properties that we have. ","Rich Hill","Got it, thank you guys. That was really helpful. ","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Mike Mueller ","Hey, good morning, I through I got out of the queue. My question was the prior question on about how much of the 7.5 to 8 cap properties are less in the portfolio. So I think that \u2013 I heard you said it was about. ","Lisa Palmer","I don\u2019t know that we actually answered the question. So I would point you to our Investor Presentation where we have about 2% that we consider kind of non-core and think about again remind you of our funding strategy. So free cash flow is going to fund our development spend to the extent that we are short, we are going to \u2013 and do not have access to the equity market because it's not a compelling price at the time. We will use dispositions for that and it will come from that 2% bucket. ","And if you do, to give a little bit more color on page 15 in the supplemental, if you look at those, there is not a single one on here that we went out and bought individually. It either came as in the package of the of the portfolio acquisition and a couple of them were legacy developments when we are building much larger power centers back in the late marching developments, which we do not do today.","Mike Mueller ","So basically if that 2% of the portfolio was gone and we're looking in the supplemental, the disposition cap rates wouldn't be 7.5% or higher. ","Lisa Palmer","I think that's a fair assumption. ","Mike Mueller ","Got it. Okay, that was it, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please proceed with tour questions. ","Chris Lucas","Good morning everybody. Hey, just a couple of quick ones. Lisa on the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, you know $0.03 spread between 91 to 94, is there any one item that sort of causes that spread or is it just a myriad of factors that you're unsure about going in. ","Lisa Palmer ","It\u2019s you know, same priority NOI is a big driver obviously and although our guidance is 3.25 plus or minus, it can be plus or it can be minus, and Sears is a big driver of that as well depending upon when \u2013 if we get November and December we are in it and that is one of the largest drivers. ","Chris Lucas","Okay and then just kind of following up on that topic. The Mattress Firms you had rejected, given the likely scenario, the plants they're going to come out. I think they want to get out of bankruptcy this year. You'll get paid what for those rejected leases? ","Lisa Palmer","Its still, I\u2019m a little hesitant to say that I'm certain what's going to happen. So our understanding at this point is we are going to get paid for them for up to a year, but again I think its\u2026","Hap Stein","A year from when they file.","Lisa Palmer","A year from when they file. But I think that its more to come. But right now that is the assumption. ","Hap Stein","Bankruptcy is an uncertain process and we\u2019ve incorporated that into our projections.","Lisa Palmer","So just, Hap just so that I\u2019m clear. You are saying that you could get up to a year, but it would be a year from now that you would get paid or when they come out. ","Lisa Palmer","I don't know that we really know when it's, and that's part of the uncertainty as well, but the early indication is that we will get up to a year's worth of rent. ","Hap Stein","Whether that\u2019s from when they filed or it\u2019s from when they come out, we still don\u2019t know.","Chris Lucas","Okay, and as it relates to Sears in terms of the guidance you provided earlier and the drag to same store NOI from near year, does that matter as to whether that\u2019s a seven or a 11 liquidation or we just a rework and what are you guys assuming?","Hap Stein","I mean that won\u2019t matter. What matters is whether or not we actually \u2013 whether someone assumes and buys the lease or if we get it back. ","Chris Lucas","Okay, great. Thank you, I appreciate it. ","Hap Stein","Thank you, Chris. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. ","Samir Khanal","Yeah, good morning. I just had a question on the leasing spreads for new deals. I mean it was up 35%, but it didn't look like you put in a lot of CapEx. Certainly if you look at the CapEx per term in the quarter versus maybe the trailing 12, it actually fell. So I just want to know what was kind of going on there. ","Hap Stein","Samir, yeah it was interesting that it fell with the volumes and what that represents is really the driver there was Publix at our Bloomingdale Redevelopment. That particular deal is a tear down and rebuild. So what you had was less, what we call IT and White Box and it's really rebuilding a building. So that artificially dampened that number. If you took Publix out of that, we would normalize it $30, which is right in line. ","Samir Khanal","Okay, got it. And I guess my second question is just regarding your NOI guide post, you know that low to mid 2% range for \u201819. I mean how are you guys thinking about sort of credit loss reserves for \u201819 versus this year. ","You know how much cushion do you have sort of built in for maybe other distress retailers besides sort of the Sears and Mattress Firm of about certainly 90 basis points, excuse me a 50 basis points down time. ","Lisa Palmer","Again, that's not formal guidance\u2019s, so we will come back to you in early part of next year with more formal guidance. But Sears is obviously incorporated in there as I indicated in my remarks, up to 50 basis points. ","Samir Khanal","So at this point beyond Sears you are not incorporating any other? ","Lisa Palmer","Samir yes, of course we always do and even through a bad debt expense, it doesn\u2019t exactly translate to how much we are incorporating into kind of the credit collection loss if you own typical underwriting. We've been kind of around the 45 in the \u2013 40 to 50 basis points range in bad debt expense. I think that that\u2019s a good indication that we\u2019ve had a pretty normal and steady rate of move outs if you will and bankruptcies and store closures and we would expect something similar next year on top of Sears. ","Hap Stein","We're incorporating \u2013 our thinking is incorporating our normal amount of issues, but at the same time we're also incorporating that the underlying business is good, leasing spreads will remain healthy, we're seeing strong demand for space. So we feel good about the underlying fundamentals of the business and our ability to continue. The Sears bankruptcy aside, the 2.5% underlying same property NOI growth that Lisa described earlier.","Lisa Palmer","And I think my prepared remarks directly hit that and also there is even some \u2013 it\u2019s also implied, if you go back to the road map again of 1.3% contractual rent steps and then another 1.2% from rent lease spreads, that gets you to 2.5 and I just told you that we\u2019re expecting and incorporating up to 50 basis points at Sears and we're still saying we're going to be in the 2% to 2.5% range.","Samir Khanal","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.","Vince Tibone","Good morning. I have a clarification question on the Sears closures. Are you have to bid for the leases, the bankruptcy option?","Lisa Palmer","Jim, [inaudible].","Jim Thompson","It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t know. We are on a closure list, but there is no telling how Sears will \u2013 whether they'll try to sell the leases before they reject, we just don't know at this point. We are \u2013 obviously in our planning we're preparing to defend our real estate.","Vince Tibone","Got it, okay. [Cross Talk] They are still paying rent and the lease is still in place until further notice.","Can you just talk maybe a little more broadly about the pros and cons of buying a lease in bankruptcy option versus letting a new tenant you know purchase a below market lease?","Jim Thompson","Well obviously we evaluate every aspect, and I would say during the Toys we evaluated a deal in Chicago where it was at auction. We were prepared to be it if needed. We did our homework. Understood who was interested in the space and felt comfortable with that user and felt the economics of no-downtime projecting rent was a good alternative to us jumping in and protecting the real estate. So it's a one off thing we evaluate on every space that\u2019s in play.","Hap Stein","And Mac in my just review to kind of what we did with Hagan, because it was a combination of working with replacements to Hagan, buying leases and letting some of them go and coming back to us on that date.","Jim Thompson","Before Mac does individual examples, I mean the biggest thing is, is the pro is it gives us control of the real estate. It allows us to control the merchandising and in often cases which Mac is going to talk about allow us to unlock a lot of value.","Vince Tibone","Those are lease closures?","Mac Chandler","Well, you may change the use Vince, right, upgrade the use, but you also by wiping out that former lease you may get rid of some restrictions that have to do with competing uses, exclusives, co-tenancy parking requirements. Sometimes these older leases are just outdated with how the market works. So you get a fresh start and there's generally at a reasonable price. The pros heavily outweigh the cons and you take some leasing risk, you're not going to have it preleased, but we're in that business anyway and we have a good feel for that and we factor that into our pricing. So net-net its usually advantageous for us to buy a least back.","Vince Tibone","That's very helpful color. Thank you, that\u2019s all I have.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Vince.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Tsai","Hi, yes. Does having a Kmart box versus having a Sears\u2026","Hap Stein","Linda, we can\u2019t hear you.","Linda Tsai","Sorry about that. Does having a Kmart Box versus have a Sears give you more flexibility given the size and you know maybe in terms of back filling more easily with the tenant versus having to redevelop?","Lisa Palmer","The reason I commented specifically that they were Kmart's versus Sears is to see exactly the size of the box and they're in your typical neighborhood community shopping center, so there's not a whole lot of densification opportunities at those.","Linda Tsai","Okay, and then in terms of the 35% increase in new leases, can you give us a sense of what percentage of your anchor leases are considered legacy?","Mike Mas","Hey Linda, we can\u2019t give you that percentage. This is Mike, but we do have as we indicated at our Investor Day, there are 40 leases that we call \u201cLegacy Leases\u201d that are available to us in the upcoming say five plus years and those will be the leases that are going to really drive the top line rent growth metric.","Lisa Palmer","And even \u2013 it\u2019s pretty interesting, even in a portfolio of our size, it doesn't take much for it to really move the needed, because they are such large increases at these legacy anchor leases.","Mac Chandler","And they control the space for a significant amount of time. The key thing as far as the health of the portfolio and the relative strength and sustainability of the portfolio I think is the same store rent spreads that we are experiencing, 12% on the shop space.","Linda Tsai","Thanks, and then while your peers are using technology and data to better understand shopping habits and help tenants make location decision, to what extent are you engaging in these initiatives to?","Mac Chandler","Linda, I\u2019ll answer that. Lisa, do you want to take it?","Lisa Palmer","Go ahead Mac.","Mac Chandler","This is not a new thing for us. We\u2019ve actually been at the forefront of using technology to help us with merchandising, to target actual customers by using mobile data to track where our customers are coming from and we've actually been piloting probably over a dozen different technologies over the years and actually have helped companies create that technology by working with them closely. ","So we're using it for better merchandising, where we've been able to convince tenants that our sites makes sense by showing them what our customers are coming from and using technology that they don't have in house and it's been eye opening for them and that\u2019s really helped us.","And then the future really is using this technology to actually target customers coming on to our property through advertisements, through mobile phones and that\u2019s in the early stages of it, but we are spending a fair bit of time on this and the industry still has years to grow up, but it's not a new thing to us. We\u2019ve been following this for many, many years.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Mac Chandler","Thanks Linda.","Operator","Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Christy McElroy","Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just on mattress firm, I know that there\u2019s the initial closure list. It\u2019s all very fluid. There's more that\u2019s potentially coming. Just that you know you've got five closing, 20 remaining. On the 20, are they \u2013 as they sort of work through the process and potentially emerge here, are they trying to negotiate rent release on those 20 remaining or is it still sort of up in the air?","Hap Stein","Christy, as any good bankrupter will do, they will absolutely ask on every location which they did here. We\u2019ve been firm in our responses. I think the average AVR is $33 on ours. I think they are located in centers in 96% leased. They generally took very good real estate, high visibility high access. So that\u2019s when we felt over good about being strong and recapture our real estate. When asked we said no, and the five may turn into seven or eight, but at the end of the day we will proactively release those boxes in smaller phase.","Mac Chandler","Just say no.","Christy McElroy","Okay, and then just \u2013 following up on some of Ki Bin\u2019s questions, you guys were talking about Westwood a bit. Any sort of early estimates you can give us in terms of the potential for a capital commitment on this project? Is there something that you would be maybe working with partners on any non-retail components and would this project stay in the same store pool?","Mac Chandler","I can touch on the first part of that. Plus or minus $75 million is what we circle for investment in that and we would have all of the retail. We are negotiating with a partner where we would take half of the apartment, 50% interest and that\u2019s included in the $75 million. There is also approximately 75 town homes which are up for sale product and we're going to provide some of the capital for that, although that\u2019s not a long term hold as I mentioned.","So Lisa can talk to you about sort of the big picture, what\u2019s in and out of that. But we are excited about that project. It should have a return of in the high sixes. This is what a stabilized return is and it\u2019s going to be down in the project for us.","Hap Stein","And just in both cases, on the town home and multi-family developer they were negotiating with and both are best in class and both will have a meaningful amount of capital invested on this share of \u2013 of those portions of the development.","Lisa Palmer","At this point of time with the early head nod of the 2% to 2.5%, we are assuming that Westwood stays in our same property pool. But it\u2019s a great question as we really do have larger projects that we are beginning to work on, beyond \u2013 a scale beyond what we have had in the past. We got another one that\u2019s in our pipeline in San Diego in Costa Verde. It\u2019s over $5 million of NOI and we may essentially take that to zero as we redevelop it. So it\u2019s something that we are evaluating and we\u2019ll have more clarity on how we will handle those large projects in the future, but for now Westwood is assumed to be just staying in the same property pool.","Christy McElroy","Okay, and then is Giant staying at the project, has that been resolved.","Hap Stein","Giant is staying. They are going to relocate. Sorry to interrupt. Giant is planning to stay. We are going to relocate them and put them into a brand new store in a podium format with parking below them.","Christy McElroy","Okay, thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Christy.","Operator","Thank you. It appears we have no future questions at the time.

Fundamentals in shopping center business continue to be healthy, demonstrated by another quarter of solid results from our preeminent national portfolio. That said, we remain keenly aware of the changes occurring across today\u2019s retail landscape. Retailers have always faced constant need to remain relevant, through experience, through merchandise, through service, and through value.","The current environment is no different, and the best grocers and retailers are not standing still. They are focused on meeting the evolving needs of today\u2019s consumer by allowing customers to choose how, where, and when they will shop. A physical store presence remains a critically important channel, where retailers connect and service to customers. Best-in-class operators are looking for stores in high-quality shopping centers that are located close to their customers.","Regency\u2019s top grocers and retailers, including Publix, Kroger, Whole Foods, T.J.Maxx, Ulta, Panera and Orangetheory Fitness, to name a few, are addressing the evolving landscape through significant investments in technology, in experience, in price and in many cases, significant store expansions. Regency\u2019s strategic advantages position the company to not only meet the changes occurring in today\u2019s retail environment that will enable us to consistently grow shareholder value in the future.","These unequaled advantages include: a national portfolio that is distinguished in terms of its size, it\u2019s breadth and its quality; well merchandised and well-conceived shopping centers located in dense infiltrated areas, in neighborhoods with substantial purchasing power, that are must have shopping centers for successful and expanding retailers; a best-in-class national platform of teams located in our target markets throughout the country, bringing market knowledge and expertise for value creation, from asset management, development and redevelopment; a fortress balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation strategy; and most important of all, a deep and talented team that is guided by Regency\u2019s special culture.","This proven formula will allow us to sustain same property NOI growth by 3%, and earnings and dividend growth by an average of 5% to 7%. And these should generate sector leading shareholder returns over the long term. Jim?","Jim Thompson","Thanks, Hap. Core fundamentals were gratifying, with second quarter same property NOI growth of 4.2%, and occupancy at 95.5%. It is important to note that base rent was the lion\u2019s share of this, contributing 3.5% growth for the quarter. Retailers continue to behave rationally and deliberately, and are focused on leasing space in well-located centers. We think this constructive behavior is a positive for our business, and while recognizing today\u2019s changing landscape, our teams continue to have success as we focus on merchandising with best-in-class tenants, maximizing net effect of rent over the term, and minimizing downtime.","Our superior portfolio of quality is evidenced in the recent outcomes of the Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy. As you may recall, we had minimal exposure to toys, with only five leased spaces. To date, one of the centers has been sold, one box was assumed by another retailer at auction, where we experienced zero downtime, one has already been released, and we are actively engaged in discussion with multiple tenants, including HomeGoods, Trader Joe\u2019s and Publix, for the two boxes we acquired at auction. Overall, retail bankruptcies have been lower than anticipated today, leading to solid performance and our raise in same property NOI growth expectations for the year, which Lisa will discuss in more detail.","Turning to operating performance. Year-to-date rent spreads, while still healthy, are moderating a bit due to a couple of factors. First, we have a robust redevelopment pipeline, which Mac will talk more about next, where we are proactively creating flexibility to execute on accretive investments to drive future NOI growth and value creation. This means that sometimes, we will execute flat or negative growth renewal deals in return for shorter-lease terms or termination and relocation rights, which gives us the ability to control our real estate for development in the future.","Second, renewing or replacing below-market anchor leases after expiration can often have significant impact on lease spreads. In the first half of the year we had a lack of legacy anchor leases come back to us, but as we look to the second half we have several opportunities to bring these valuable spaces to market rents.","More importantly, we\u2019ve had great success including embedded annual rent increases in our leases, and over the last four years, have averaged 2.5% contractual increases on nearly 90% of our shop deals we\u2019ve executed. This effort is certainly reflected in our strong same property NOI and cash flow growth over the last several years. Mac?","Mac Chandler","Thank you, Jim. The investment environment for institutional-grade shopping centers is stable and there continues to be solid demand, particularly for the highest quality properties where a diverse array of buyers continues to drive pricing. On the selling side, we\u2019ve seen an adequate buyer pool for our commodity centers. These buyers are seeking solid growth and have access to debt financing. To date, we have closed on $143 million of dispositions at an average cap rate of 7.9%. Pricing in these transactions has met expectations, and we have a visible pipeline to achieve our disposition plan of $275 million for 2018.","Consistent with past years, we typically sell 1% to 2% of our asset base annually. The proceeds, combined with free cash flow, are reinvested into value-add developments and redevelopments, premier acquisitions with superior growth prospects, or our own stock, when pricing is compelling and tax gains are manageable. We believe this perpetual enhancement to our portfolio uniquely fortifies our NOI growth rate.","Turning to development and redevelopment. We are making impressive progress with our in-process pipeline. Leasing velocity is strong, and rents our meeting or exceeding the expectations. Case in point, we recently completed our chimney lock development located in affluent Somerset County, New Jersey. This $71 million investment is anchored by Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack and Zacks Outfit. We are pleased to report that the center is 97% leased, with retail sales exceeding tenant expectations.","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, new groundup development opportunities that meet our high standards and disciplined strategy, remain challenging to source. Fortunately, Regency\u2019s preeminent portfolio is full of redevelopment opportunities that are being mined by our talented development team. The following is an update on just a few of our near-term prospects.","The Abbot, a true iconic property located in the heart of Harvard Square, should start by year-end. All approvals have been obtained to allow the transformation of our three historic buildings into one integrated retail office flagship.","Next is that the redevelopment of our midrise building, at Market Common Clarendon in Arlington. We intend to modernize and expand this 1960s era building into a new state-of-the-art four-level structure, with dynamic ground floor retail fronting Whole Foods. Preleasing interest has been strong, including the execution of a full four lease with a luxury fitness club, which will serve as another exciting draw for the entire project.","Located in Bethesda, Westwood Shopping Center is another exciting infill redevelopment opportunity. The first phase will consist of approximately 150,000 square feet of neighborhood retail, anchored by a top-performing giant, 200 units of apartments and 75 for-sale townhomes. We have strong interest in the residential components, where Regency plans to partner with best-in-class codevelopers, to create an integrated project that will draw from this affluent trade area.","These three redevelopments are all projected to start within the next 12 months, with an aggregate cost of approximately $170 million, and will generate an average incremental return of 8%. These are just a few examples of the kinds of compelling value add opportunities which our portfolio and platform reports. Our experienced team is excited by the many opportunities in the pipeline, and we have visibility to exceed $1 billion of development and redevelopment starts and deliveries over the next five years. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Mac, and good morning, everyone. We had another impressive quarter of same property NOI growth that was primarily driven by base rents. As Jim said, base rent growth contributed 3.5% for the quarter, and 3.7% year-to-date, a reflection of the strength of the portfolio, with healthy embedded rent steps as well as the result of accretive asset management in redevelopments. This strong performance during the first half of the year, combined with less tenant fallout than we originally projected, allowed us to raise our expectations around same property NOI growth. We have removed the potential for finishing in the bottom half of our previous range, and now expect to finish the year at 2.75% to 3.25%.","As we\u2019ve communicated previously, we will experience a deceleration in the back half of the year, with some property growth in the low 2% range for both the third and fourth quarters. Timing and the lumpiness of certain NOI line items are the primary factors, as our guidance range does include very healthy base rent growth of 3%-plus through the remainder of the year. I think it would be helpful to take a minute and walk you through the primary drivers of this deceleration.","First, we expect recovery rates to normalize through the back half of the year, and end the year in line with 2017 levels. Second, as Jim mentioned, while we are making great progress on the toys boxes that we acquired out of bankruptcy, we will experience downtime in the third and fourth quarters. Third, we\u2019re going up against tough comps as we completed the major redevelopment of Serramonte, in the fourth quarter of last year. And finally, the timing of other income was front end loaded this year versus last. As we look through these timing impacts, the growth in the second half of 2018, I\u2019d like to reiterate that base rent growth is on track to remain above 3%, in both the third and fourth quarters.","Turning to earnings, we have modestly increased our Nareit FFO and operating FFO guidance ranges, incorporating the better performance through the second quarter, driven by same property NOI growth. And as a reminder, operating FFO eliminates non-comparable onetime items as well as certain non-cash accounting items, like straight line rent and above-below market rent amortization. And I also think it\u2019s important to remind you, that these non-cash items are expected to total $54 million this year, which at the midpoint \u2013 it\u2019s $54 million at the midpoint, which is $0.32 per share.","Before turning the call over for questions, I would like to quickly touch on the new lease accounting rule that will go into effect in 2019. Many of you are aware that this accounting change will impact that way REITs will recognize certain internal leasing costs. Some of these costs have been capitalized with leasing activity, but after adopting the new standard next year, these internal costs will need to be expensed. We anticipate the impact to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.07 per share, on 2019 earnings.","And while this will impact reported earnings, it does not impact AFFO, or cash flow, and we do not have any intention of allowing this accounting change, which doesn\u2019t have a true economic impact on the business, to influence our structure or compensation strategies.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Jeremy Metz","Hey good morning. A question for Mac here, just in terms of what you\u2019ve been selling and you\u2019ve sold post quarter. Are you seeing any shifts in pricing or bidding pools? Maybe a little color on the market. And then including the stuff you\u2019ve sold out through the quarter, you\u2019re at around $150 million of sale, this leaves you another $125 million, $130 million to go, to reach your guidance. You still assume a mid-7.5% cap rate, you\u2019ve sold at about an 8% here. So that implies this next level would be closer to 7% cap, is that fair? And maybe, you can just give some color on those assets and what\u2019s driving that better pricing; maybe it\u2019s just simply better assets.","Mac Chandler","Sure. Thanks, Jeremy. On the first half, I think the one change we have noticed is it does appear, within our personal assets we\u2019re selling and in the marketplace that once buyers and sellers are agreeing a price, that transactions are closing. There\u2019s certainly a higher degree and a higher level of certainty that, that is improved, really in the last 60, 90 days. So it seems like assets are clearing, and we\u2019ve found that to be the case.","Your question on what\u2019s remained to be sold, we feel confident that we\u2019ll meet our objectives for the year, $275 million. We\u2019ve got about $60 million in contracts that we\u2019re negotiating. And for the remainder of that, some properties are on the market and some we\u2019re preparing to take to market. But we feel, overall, on that blended number is still in line with that plus-or-minus 7.5%. So what\u2019s to be sold, it\u2019s a mix some smaller properties and some bigger properties. But in general, it meets that same strategy of typically non-strategic assets, often those have lower growth profiles, but they\u2019re good assets, and we found a lot of activity there. And probably, more buyers who are putting forth credible offers than we\u2019ve seen recently. So we\u2019re confident in seeing that.","Jeremy Metz","Great. Thanks. And have \u2013 following on your remarks, at the start of the call about the best grocers not standing still. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing here in terms of grocers thinking more creatively about future space needs and formats, and your discussion? And then, you\u2019ve obviously, done a number of deals at Whole Foods. Are you seeing any sort of increased activity or interest from them to expand further or try a new formats post-merger?","Hap Stein","I\u2019ll start, and then Mac will probably add. Whole Foods has been much more active since the closing with Amazon on \u2013 their store formats are very similar to what they\u2019ve been in the past. From a size standpoint, I mean, we\u2019re still seeing typical public store in the 50,000-square-foot range, Kroger in the 100,000 square-foot range. The Wegmans that we\u2019re opening up in Raleigh and in Washington, D.C. are 100,000-plus. We are seeing a number of the grocers that are trying to fit into more dense infill locations, they\u2019ll show more flexibility. But as far as any major changes to their formats, we\u2019re not seeing that.","Obviously, we\u2019ve read a lot about some of the moves that we all have \u2013 that Kroger has made as far as their partnership with Ocado et cetera. So there\u2019s a lot of investment in technology, investment in click and collect. And I think they are attacking the business on all fronts, and once again, in many case, that also involves adding some new bricks and mortar stores. Mac, do you want to add anything?","Mac Chandler","No. I think there\u2019s a premium placed on location as opposed to prototype. And it appears that grocers are being slightly more flexible than before, in terms of size, sort of plus-or-minus 5,000 to 10,000 feet. But they really value that location that leads to customers. And there are many opportunities that they\u2019re looking at, and we like what we see.","Hap Stein","And we want to make sure that we have adequate space to provide experience, which I think is a \u2013 they feel is a key differentiating factor.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And last one for me, just to spread it around here. Jim, you talked about some shorter term deals are giving more rights here. As I look at your renewals in the quarter, activity-wise, it was pretty consistent. But if I look at the leasing spreads, it was out a little lower. And then, if you look at the TIs, those are almost double your more or less, normal spend. So is this simply a reflection of what you\u2019re alluding to? Or maybe there\u2019s a few larger driving these metrics? Any color there?","Jim Thompson","Jeremy, I think as far as the capital spend goes, I think it\u2019s mostly timing issue. And I think if you look at the year-end annualized basis, we\u2019re going to be in the 10% to 11% of total NOI on total CapEx spend, which is where we\u2019ve been. I think as to growth, we did have a \u2013 we had a smaller pool of anchor opportunity. We think, in the second half, we will have more opportunity to recapture some of those legacy anchor deals and bring them to market. One example of that is we just executed a lease with Publix, down in Tampa, to backfill a Wal-Mart store. And that we took that rent from $4 to $16 per square foot deal. So again, I think, at the end of the day we think we will be on the spread side in the high single-digit, which is consistent with our strategic plan.","Hap Stein","And our net effective rents are mid-double digits like 15-plus percent. And I\u2019d also say, and I don\u2019t want to come across as being defensive here, but it is interesting to note, that over the last five years, Regency\u2019s rent growth appears to be middle of sector. However, last five years, our NOI growth is at the top of the sector. And things like embedded rent growth that is getting us there, and less exposure to some of the bankruptcies and tenant failures, so you got to add it, altogether. And it is hard comparing comparability both internally, year-to-year, on what space may come up, what we consider for rent growth and what others in the sector may. So we feel really good, as Jim said it, about our increase in net effective rents. As Lisa indicated, the base rent should increase by over 3% in the second half of the year, we\u2019re on track to do that, and continuing to achieve 3% NOI growth, for this foreseeable future.","Jim Thompson","Hap said that so well. I hate adding something \u2013 a little bit more on detail and granular. But I don\u2019t \u2013 but, Jeremy, if you\u2019re referring to Page 19 disclosure, in our sup, where we have our TIs, I just want to remind you, we have the new disclosure last quarter. And we did disclose it, we told you it was an abnormally low level. So I believe, for new leases, our total spend is in the $16 foot range. And I just wanted to even remind you then that, that would not be \u2013 that was abnormal. And that wouldn\u2019t be the case going forward, and it we\u2019d be more in the $30 to $40 per square foot range, which is where we were this quarter.","Jeremy Metz","I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Katy McConnell","Good morning. This is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Since one of your recent dispositions had a former toys box, can you talk about how buyers are underwriting box vacancies? Or even just at-risk tenant exposure when evaluating specific centers today?","Mac Chandler","Sure. I\u2019d be happy to. For the particular asset, this was pretty unusual. So what we did is we actually gave this buyer some time to actually find a replacement tenant and they did. And it allowed us to maximize our price, allowed them to pay more for it, and they were actually able to get a tenant, get a real estate committee approval and get a lease in hand. And we thought that was a win-win in both sides. So they backfilled it with the Burlington. And in every case, it is different \u2013 different, case-by-case, as to how acquirers are backfilling boxes, but we thought that was a smart strategy, so it worked out well for us. But that that\u2019s how that happened there.","Hap Stein","And it is indicative though, that the buyers today are more discerning, they are more risk-averse, but I think this is also indicative that even though we\u2019re selling based upon non-strategic, lower growth profile, these are still pretty decent assets that we\u2019re targeting for sale. And they\u2019re not out of the middle or the top part of our portfolio.","Katy McConnell","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Schmidt","Hi, good morning. Is the higher construction costs impacting the future redevelopment yields \u2013 some of the things that you addressed happening going forward?","Mac Chandler","I would say that the current projects that we have and the imminent projects, we have priced in the construction increases that we are all seeing out there. And this isn\u2019t a new phenomena, this has been going on for last couple of years. As you get further out, two, three years, it is harder to project construction costs. But most industry think that the last two years are abnormally high and construction costs are going to start to moderate at some point, and go back to traditional levels of inflation. But I wouldn\u2019t say that is a reason for our yields, it\u2019s a summation of incoming costs, it\u2019s everything. And I think we\u2019ve done a good job of managing that. You can tell by our in-process projects outlay, that are coming in as underwritten. And I think we do a lot of work and accurately forecast what our costs are.","Hap Stein","The \u2013 but the deals are still penciling out in \u2013 on the basis that make compelling sense.","Craig Schmidt","Great. And then, I believe, in your presentation, it says that nearly 20% of your tenant base is restaurants. Is that where you\u2019d like to be? Or would you like to take it higher, or possibly, even lower?","Mac Chandler","20%, we\u2019ve been kind of in the high 15% to 20% for a long time. And that feels like \u2013 that feels like that right space to be. I think it is a bit self-governing between anchor requirements and parking \u2013 reality and the ability to park to the customer. So we think that\u2019s kind of the sweet spot, and we like the place we are right there.","Craig Schmidt","Perfect. Okay, thank you.","Mac Chandler","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Hi, good morning guys. I want to come back to, maybe, some of your prepared remarks. Maybe talk about the slowdown that is being implied by your same-store NOI guide. You guys have generally done a pretty good job of being cautious. So if you could just give me, maybe, a little bit more color around how you\u2019re thinking about that. Is there anything specifically driving that? Or is it just you wanting to be a little bit more cautious, and make sure that you\u2019re really seeing signs of infection before moving things even higher?","Lisa Palmer","Sure. And I will go right back to my prepared remarks and reference those. But first, I want to start with, because this is also in my prepared remarks, that we are seeing really solid base rent growth, which is the primary driver of our same property NOI growth. And that, for the year, is at 3.7%, year-to-date. We will see that come down slightly as a result of, again, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned the tougher comps on the completed redevelopments in the latter half of last year, but still north of 3% for the second \u2013 for both \u2013 in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter we\u2019re going to see more of a slow down because we have the major redevelopment at Serramonte coming online with rent commenced by then.","So we feel really good about the fact that we\u2019re going to have a full year with base rent growth north of 3%. The other items there are some timing issues involved with those, and a big one is recovery income. So the timing for cam recovery is really related more to last year. So this year was much more typical. Last year we had a major merger that we were integrating, and the reconciliation timing was a little bit unusual for the year. So we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a drag in the third quarter for that reason. And then in the fourth quarter of this year, we will see a drag from real estate tax recoveries, if you will, and assessments and the recovery for the income for that.","As we expected, when we merged with Equity One, we knew that our properties, and specifically, in certain states, like California, would be reassessed. And those are coming in. And they also go back to the date of the merger, so it\u2019s a little bit of a double hit. So in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to have a significant impact on same property NOI as a result of that. We recover a lot of it, but we can\u2019t recover all of it. And then, we have other income \u2013 was more front end loaded in 2018 versus 2017, and they\u2019re really the main drivers.","Mac Chandler","And that \u2013 from a narrative standpoint and from an anecdotal what\u2019s really happening with the underlying fundamentals, this does not reflect that we\u2019re seeing a moderation fundamentals between the first half of the year and the second half of the year. It\u2019s just the items that Lisa articulated.","Rich Hill","Got it. That\u2019s very, very helpful. And maybe one question, follow-up question, maybe expanding up on their risk return on invested capital. Have you guys thought about \u2013 I\u2019m sure you have \u2013 have you done an analysis on densification opportunities across the portfolio? Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of talk about this, particularly, with autonomous over the next five to 10 years. But I\u2019m curious if you think there is specific, or even, general densification opportunity that could help you drive growth even further.","Hap Stein","I think that Mac articulated three major redevelopments that are underway. And you can kind of summary review those again, we\u2019re \u2013 very, very exciting redevelopments. And I think three of them involve some sort densification, or they\u2019re in infill \u2013 dense infill locations. Plus, a couple of more that were backed behind those.","Mac Chandler","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. We, as part of our day-to-day business, we\u2019re constantly evaluating our portfolio for densification opportunities. And in many cases, we\u2019ve seen actually, really just prescribe to us, additional entitlements, even [indiscernible] and they\u2019re doing that to encourage housing, and as part of their general planned update. You can\u2019t access them all right away. Oftentimes, it takes the expiration of an anchor lease. And so we note that when that happens, and we start to plan ahead of that. So we\u2019ve done that with quite a few people, but they\u2019ll \u2013 there will be a sort of our methodological approach to it which will happen over time. But we definitely think there are some opportunities. And our teams are keenly focused on that.","Hap Stein","And as we stated in the past, we have hired a Senior Vice President of Mixed-use that works directly with Mac, who has extensive experience in the multifamily sector. And I will say that we\u2019ve got great properties, some with great potential. But these , especially, vertical mixed-use projects are complicated, they\u2019re challenging, they\u2019re easier to talk about that to make happen, they take years to create and bring fruition. We try to rightsize and have a very practical approach. We\u2019re making very good progress on a number of these, but to underestimate what\u2019s involved, and making them successful \u2013 anybody doing that, it would be mistake, because there\u2019s not a [indiscernible]","Rich Hill","Thank you, guys. I appreciate all the different color.","Hap Stein","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Mueller","A couple of questions here. First of all, on the extra lease accounting items for the expense. Where \u2013 what\u2019s the geography of where that\u2019s going to shop in the income statement, going forward, in 2018?","Lisa Palmer","That will be in G&A.","Mike Mueller","Okay. And then it was touched on before with the rent spreads, and I know there was a high single-digit number that was thrown out there. If you go through and you strip out the impact of the repositionings that you were talking about, and just look at the spreads minus that, would they be in the upper single-digit, close to the double-digit level?","Lisa Palmer","I\u2019m not sure we fully understand what you\u2019re asking.","Mike Mueller","So your rent spreads are mid-single digits.","Lisa Palmer","Right.","Mike Mueller","And you went through \u2013 there was a bunch of caveats as to they moderated. If you would take the repositioning aspect of that out that was weighing on it, would that, all of a sudden, if you had no redev in there, would your spreads be closer to that double-digit level?","Michael Mas","Mike, This is Mike. I\u2019ll jump in here. There\u2019s really, in this particular quarter it really is a mix issue. We are seeing some active leases that we\u2019re signing in anticipation of potential repositioning. Oftentimes, these are happening two to three maybe, four years in advance of when we start a redevelopment. That\u2019s how long it takes to position some properties for redevelopment. So to answer your direct question, in the math this particular quarter, not seeing a lot of material change in how you slice and dice that particular population. But we are seeing an impact of lease spreads metric when we make some of these decisions. And on trailing a 12-month basis, what\u2019s important is we are posting a lease metric number that is in excess of what we did this quarter. And as Hap mentioned earlier, our net effective rent spreads are in the 15% range, which we feel really good about.","Mike Mueller","Got it, okay. That was it. Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Mike.","Mac Chandler","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Lucas","Good morning everybody. Just a quick question on the \u2013 follow-up on the same-store NOI guidance for the back half of the year question. You mentioned a number of items that are contributing to the expected deceleration. But I guess, more \u2013 the question I have is really more about rent commencement and timing. You have a pretty good handle of that. There\u2019s been a number of your peers that talked about permitting issues that they\u2019ve experienced and the timing issues that are going into the uncertainty they have with the back half of the year. What are you guys seeing?","Lisa Palmer","We do have a pretty good handle. And trust me, Chris, I ask that question pretty frequently. On what \u2013 really, the main drivers are the anchor rent commencements that are expected to happen in the back half of the year. And we feel really confident and good in our projections to when those will happen.","Chris Leavitt","Not that\u2026","Chris Lucas","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up\u2026","Lisa Palmer","Not that there\u2019s some risks that it could flip, but we\u2026","Hap Stein","Or it\u2019s not taking a while to happen, but we feel pretty good of the timing that we\u2019re projecting.","Chris Lucas","Okay, thanks. And just a quick one, I missed the earliest \u2013 or the beginning of the call. So, I don\u2019t know if you touched on this, but the number of the projects either delivered with a slightly higher \u2013 well, a couple of projects, either delivered with slightly higher than previously sort of projected yields, or are trending towards higher yields. Anything particular that\u2019s driving that, other than just better rents?","Mac Chandler","In one case, it was actually a reduction in costs. We were able to get back some contingency that was then spent. And the other piece, slightly better rents, so. It isn\u2019t as parts in there, those were specific, and we were glad to see those results.","Hap Stein","That is an example, where we were able to take money from contingencies, where we are planning for these significant increases that are occurring in the construction costs.","Jim Thompson","I mean, if I may, no pressure on Mac or the rest of the team, but we report to our board, quarterly, on the performance of our developments, and have been for the entire time that I\u2019ve been here. And we\u2019ve developed, probably, $2 billion-plus worth of properties. And our actual returns on that $2 billion are pretty darn close to our underwritten return, which is pretty exceptional. So we have \u2013 a lot of the assessment to the team and how we underwrite and manage, and actually, execute on the build of those projects.","Chris Lucas","Great, thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Mac Chandler","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Hap Stein for closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate your time. Have a good weekend. And if you get to spend some time with your families over the rest of the summer, good luck and enjoy. Thank you so much for your time and interest in Regency.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for Regency Centers Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Mas, you may begin.","Mike Mas","Good morning and welcome to Regency's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer our President and Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Executive Vice President of Development; Jim Thompson, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we begin, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information regarding these non-GAAP measures can be found in Company documents filed with the SEC. [Operator Instructions].","I'll now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call. Our talented team continues to deliver impressive results in each of the key aspects of the business. The underlying fundamentals of Regency's high-quality portfolio remain strong. The portfolio is distinguished by sustainable advantages from locations and desirable trade areas and by merchandising to highly productive grocers and best-in-class retailers and restaurants. And we're continuing to find value-add developments and acquisitions with superior growth prospects.","In addition and as we have clearly stated, having a fortress balance sheet is integral to our strategy to provide the financial flexibility to efficiently capitalize on compelling investment opportunities and profitably weather future storms that may arise. With that in mind, just a few weeks ago we successfully raised $400 million of equity capital which further strengthen our balance sheet by reducing leverage on an earnings accretive basis and creating additional capacity to fund a growing investment pipeline. I want to stress that we will remain disciplined and selective to ensure that any allocation of capital is consistent with the high quality of our existing collection of grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers and offers attractive prospects for growth and\/or value creation.","Finally and n most important of all, I want to emphasize how well positioned Regency is for the future. First, our portfolio which by all measures of quality is among the top in the sector, is poised to sustain 3% NOI growth. Second, our development program which is widely recognized by key anchors, retailers and restaurants and by the important market players as best in class, will enable us to start and deliver $200 million of premier centers at attractive returns. Third, our balance sheet which is one of the most pristine in the whole REIT sector, provides an incredible amount of flexibility to cost effectively fund compelling investment opportunities.","And our team which is guided by Regency's special culture, is in my mind without peer in terms of talent, depth and engagement. These distinguishing features ensure we're better positioned than ever to compound future core earnings per share growth that should average 6% to 7%. This, together with consistent gains in NAV and accelerated dividend increases, will be our recipe to sustained growth and shareholder value.","Mac Chandler, our Executive Vice President of Development, will now provide an update on investments. Mac?","Mac Chandler","Thanks, Hap. Good morning. On our last call we shared with you our plans for two pending acquisitions. Mid quarter we closed on the retail portion of Market Common Clarendon in Metro DC. This iconic mixed-use project anchored by a high-volume Whole Foods and a strong mix of exceptional retailers including Apple boosts upside from redevelopment which will be expertly mined by our DC team. Subsequent to quarter we acquired Klahanie Shopping Centers in Seattle for $36 million. Anchored by Krogers QFC banner, Klahanie is located in a very affluent community where we already own several high-performing centers. These two new acquisitions will enhance Regency's portfolio with trade areas benefiting from high income [indiscernible], productive grocers, best-in-class retailers and the opportunity to capitalize on below market rents.","The centers are projected to generate substantial NOI growth and IRRs that roughly average in the mid-6% range. With respect to our development program, our capabilities positioned Regency to profitably enhance portfolio quality and generate premium returns to comparable acquisitions. Take our La Floresta Whole Foods development in Orange County which we completed this quarter. It's a great example of superb execution of Regency's fresh look merchandising and design. And it's already at 99% leased to a fabulous lineup of local, regional and national retailers and restaurants. The returns reflect a spread to market cap rates of over 300 basis points.","Our in-process developments are also performing extremely well and are approaching 90% leased. More specifically, our Springwoods development in Houston represents further evidence of the combination of well-conceived development and fresh look. Although we just broke ground, more than 80% of the Center is leased and committed, including a top-notch set of retailers to complement our best-in-class grocer. While there's still a good bit of work to be done, we remain confident in our ability to start an average of $200 million of developments and redevelopments annually and maintain our full-year guidance range. Our expectation is that the vast majority will begin in the fourth quarter. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Mac. Good morning, everyone. I am again pleased with the results this quarter. As Hap mentioned, the critical ingredient of our winning strategy is the quality of our portfolio. Highly productive anchors and great locations together with the team's focus enable us to merchandise to best-in-class retailers. This proven combination drives pricing power, percent leased and in turn, NOI and earnings growth. The result of our efforts are evident in our numbers again this quarter.","Same-property NOI grew by 3.4%, with base rent once again as the primary contributing factor. Full-year same-property NOI guidance remains unchanged, though, as we do expect growth to moderate throughout the second half of the year as we face higher comps from rent-paying occupancy and as we begin to feel the impact of previously announced bankruptcies. Regarding these bankruptcies, our leasing teams are working diligently on replacing these tenants with more productive operators.","We already have some good news to report at our location in Northern California where Target has acquired the former Sports Authority space, resulting in no down time and no loss of rent. We're excited about this clear upgrade for the center. Another factor expected to impact the second half of the year is the large-scale transformation of one of our centers near Aventura Mall in Miami. Most of the tenants at this location will be offline as we scrape and rebuild the center which will feature a podium format Publix with parking underneath.","Although we will experience loss of NOI in the near term, this renovation will add substantial value and future NOI growth to our portfolio in the long run. The leasing environment continues to be robust with shop spaces in the same property portfolio at 92.4% leased, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. In fact, shop space fundamentals have been strong all around, with rent growth at 12% in the last two quarters. We find these trends to be highly encouraging and positive indicators of the leasing environment and tenant health.","Turning to Capital Markets, our ability to create meaningful value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation is a key component of our strategy. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing several transactions we've executed since May which further underscores the enviable position that Regency is in today. In the interest of time, I'll just quickly touch on the highlights and ask that you please refer to the press release for more details. First, we settled a portion of our forward equity offering to acquire Market Common Clarendon and Klahanie Shopping Center. Second, we issued $400 million of equity that will allow us to eliminate high coupon debt in mid-August.","And finally we expanded our term loan by $100 million, taking our line of credit balance to $0. Most importantly, these actions have significantly improved our current long-term projections of key performance metrics, including growth and earnings, dividends, free cash flow and a sector-leading net debt to EBITDA which is currently well below 5 times, offering incredible flexibility to enhance Regency's performance even further. ","Before turning it over to Q&A, I'll touch on the guidance changes that are detailed in our press release and supplemental. We revised our full-year NAREIT FFO guidance to a new range of $2.71 to $2.76. This incorporates the one-time charges from the early redemption of our 2017 bonds and the settlement of our forward starting slots. In addition, we raised core FFO guidance to a new range of $3.22 to $3.27 per share, driven by increases from our recent acquisitions and interest savings from our bond redemption. ","In closing, I'm extremely gratified by the accomplishments our team has achieved, positioning Regency to sustained growth and shareholder value. Thank you for listening and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jay Carlington from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Carlington","Lisa, just to touch on your balance sheet comments there. I guess, has the decision to maybe redeem your notes and the recent equity offering indicate you guys are going to pursue a more conservative balance sheet? And maybe as a follow-up, can you remind us what your long-term debt targets are?","Lisa Palmer","Sure. I think that pursuing a more conservative balance sheet isn't new. I hope that we've been delivering that message for the past several years, that we've really worked towards improving the balance sheet. The most important thing is to ensure that we have a well laddered profile. And we now don't have any significant maturities until 2020. So that's really important, but then secondly, to maintain a net debt to EBITDA below 5 times throughout the cycle. So when we can take advantage of being much lower than that so that we have the flexibility to really be offensive and act on opportunities if they present themselves at a time when the markets aren't as open and aren't as cheap, then that's the position we want to be in. And as we're today. So we absolutely want to be conservative. And long term we'd like to average around 5 times.","Jay Carlington","Okay. Maybe just changing gears on your guidance page for your NAV disclosure. I guess there's an additional color on undeveloped land or land held for future development. Is that just fine tuning or is there land that was reclassified there?","Mac Chandler","That's just fine-tuning of the disclosure, Jay. And there's no change to any of that from a strategy sampling, just trying to make it a little more prominent for the users.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Christine McElroy","Lisa, sorry if you mentioned this. Just looking ahead to further use of this capital. When do you expect to settle the remaining forward equity? Is that in your 2016 guidance?","Lisa Palmer","No, Christine. We actually don't have a set time. We would like to use that for new investments. We have until June of next year to settle it. It is not incorporated into our guidance.","Christine McElroy","Okay, got that. And then in terms of acquisitions and new investments, just realizing that's not in the guidance. But what are you sort of seeing in terms of the pipeline? Are there more opportunities today? And how do you think about -- how are you thinking about acquisitions and investment differently as your cost of equity continues to decrease with the strength in your stock price?","Lisa Palmer","I think that we've been active over the past two years with acquisitions. So there has been more opportunities than meeting our investment criteria. We certainly haven't been successful on every opportunity that we've pursued. And in fact I think probably for every 10 we may underwrite and look at, we're probably successful in 1 or 2 of them. So we continue to see opportunities, although there's no guarantee that we will be the successful bidder. To the extent that we can get --","Hap Stein","Or decide to buy.","Lisa Palmer","Or decide to buy. To the extent that we can see off-market opportunities which are really hard to come by, they typically come through relationships. So for every maybe 50 we look at, 1 is a true off-market opportunity. Those are the best. And we will continue to try pursue those. The way we think about our cost of capital, especially now that we've already raised some and we have -- we do have capital available to buy, we're targeting unlevered IRRs in the 6% to 6\/2% range which is lower than it was three years ago.","Hap Stein","And in addition to that, we only want to buy centers that are going to be accretive to our long-term growth rate and meet our quality standards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Tayo Okusanya","Just a couple from me, first of all, could you quantify the NOI loss you do expect from scraping the asset that's right next to the Aventura Mall? Just want to make sure we have that in our numbers","Lisa Palmer","I'm not sure. I think of bps in terms of same-property NOI growth. And Jim may have the actual NOI number. But I think it's about 15 basis point impact to same-property NOI. So it's significant.","Hap Stein","In 2016.","Tayo Okusanya","So that's helpful.","Lisa Palmer","For one property, that's significant.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. And then second of all, could you just give an update in regards to Sports Authority and kind what's happening with those boxes within your portfolio?","Lisa Palmer","Let me answer kind of big picture and how it's impacting our numbers. And then I'll let Jim talk about the actual real estate. So we did have one move out. And again, he can add color to this. We had move one out the end of the quarter. So, that impacted our percent leased as of period end. We hadn't experienced any NOI loss yet year to date. So we do expect bankruptcies to have a negative 50 basis point impact to our same-property NOI growth in the second half of the year. So when you weigh that with the Sports LA, Eastern Mountain Sports bankruptcies and other smaller ones, the impact of bankruptcies on the full year, on same-property NOI percent growth is about 40 basis points. I'll let Jim actually talk about the real estate. But that's the impact to the numbers and the guidance.","Jim Thompson","Yes. As Lisa indicated, Target assumed our Northern California lease which is a huge merchandising upgrade for us. Our two remaining other leases, both stores are closed today. We expect a slight discount to in-place rents with 12 to 18 months of downtime associated with those. But we're actively engaged with -- in dialogue with replacement retailers. So we feel pretty good about the replacement prospect at this point. Obviously, a upgrade to quality of the retailer.","Tayo Okusanya","Just one more for me. The Clarendon asset that was acquired close to a 4% cap, could you talk a little bit about what ultimate stabilized yields would be after all the mark-to-market and as well as the redevelopment of the adjacent parcel? Like, what could that number look like and how soon could you get there with that?","Lisa Palmer","In terms of how soon we could get there, the way we took, I believe, a conservative approach to underwriting the redevelopment opportunity of, really, the vacant building and don't expect to receive any income from that parcel until 2018. So we do have time. I'd also like to point out, we've already outperformed our initial underwriting with some tenants -- a tenant exercising a renewal option and then also we had projected the sports club that there's to move out.","And they've actually -- they're still paying rent as well. In terms of stabilized yield, it's in the same ballpark as all the others. And we're looking at our acquisitions that with going-in cap rates of a 5% to a 5.5% and stabilizing near 6%. Market Common Clarendon will not be any different than that which is evidenced by the north of 5% NOI growth that we're projecting there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Please proceed with your question.","Floris van Dijkum","I had one question for Lisa in terms of -- and obviously you guys have done a great job on the balance sheet. I noticed you got -- as you think about terming out your debt, are you going to be looking to -- for any new bond offerings, et cetera to look to extend the maturity on your existing debt outstanding?","Lisa Palmer","Floris, it will really depend on if we have -- if any other investment opportunities. We still have some equity to put to use. But to the extent that can find acquisitions or increase the size of our development pipeline and we would think about funding that not with -- just not just with equity but potentially with new debt and also potentially with property sales. And it will depend on really the capital markets at that time because right at this moment, there's no need for additional debt.","Hap Stein","Tremendous amount of flexibility, as both Lisa and I indicated.","Floris van Dijkum","Right. And then the other question is more of a strategic question in terms of Clarendon. And I know, Lisa, you and I've probably talked about this over the past couple of years. But as you look out 2 to 3 years, do you expect that Regency is going own more of these kinds of big, dominance sort of lifestyle centers? Or do you think this is sort of a one-off?","Hap Stein","We'll be on several larger community shopping centers. We have a great property in Raleigh, North Carolina, kind of shopping center that we've owned for well over 10 years. We redevelop an iconic property, made it iconic, in Westlake in Southern California. So community shopping centers, some of whom -- some of which have some lifestyle components has been a part of our strategy long term and will continue to be. But I would still say that it's in the 20%-plus percent range today as a percentage of NOI. And it may go up some, but not substantially. As we said often, our strategy is community and neighborhood shopping centers and will continue to be so.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Schmidt","I guess my question is also on the Market Common Clarendon. You mentioned near-term expiring. And it sounded like in Tayo's question you mentioned the Washington Sports Club maybe leaving. Are there any other anchor or junior anchors leaving? Or is the rest of the near-term lease expiring in line shops?","Lisa Palmer","We don't -- the renewal also was the bittersweet. It was actually Barnes & Noble. So we did -- there is significant upside in that rent, even after. Renewal option was even a large increased. What we had underwritten was that it was going to be down for little while, while we replaced it with a better operator. Such that it was bittersweet. We kept the income at a higher rent, but now we have to wait, I believe, the renewal was for five years. So now we have to for another five years in order to replace that tenant. Beyond that, we do have -- so Washington Sports Club is also a short-term renewal. And we anticipate that we will have the opportunity to replace that as well at a higher rent","Jim Thompson","And we have the right to terminate when we find a replacement later.","Lisa Palmer","And then the other upside is really -- it comes from smaller spaces and then the redevelopment of the vacant parcel.","Craig Schmidt","The vacant parcel, is it eat or west of the center? Does it have Clarendon exposure?","Lisa Palmer","I'm a female. We don't think north, south, east, west. It actually -- so the front door today actually comes out to Clarendon Boulevard. So it's facing the Barnes & Noble. We could potentially reconfigure that so that that the door could face the Whole Foods and do ground-floor retail so that it is -- it does have Clarendon exposure. We think that there's incredible amount of upside there.","A Hap Stein","It really does sit on the pin corner of the property.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. I notice you have a Cheesecake Factory. In the renovation of that out-parcel -- I'm sorry, parcel, would you be adding maybe more restaurants?","Lisa Palmer","So Cheesecake Factory is down the other -- I guess that would be, it's toward DC, I know that -- no, it's the other way. It's opposite DC. It's down the other end. Very well could be restaurants. But I wouldn't anticipate it being a large-use restaurant like that. I would anticipate smaller and have some outdoor seating because there is a little bit of a courtyard there. But again, we're in the really early stages. We did give ourselves some time to really explore what would be the best long-term use","Hap Stein","Throughout the project we expect to be able to add some additional excellent restaurant operators. We think that's a real opportunity there. And just to note, the parcel that's available is an old Sears which is, as Lisa and Jim indicated, is strategically located on the site.","Operator","There are no other questions in queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate your time and interest in Regency. Thank you very much. And everybody have a great day and the rest of the week. And if you're in hot weather, stay cool.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

I will now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you, sir. You may now begin.","Mike Mas","[Indiscernible] 2014 Conference Call. Joining me today is Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call.

Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Regency's talented team continues to perform well, executing our strategy. First, building on the enhanced and intrinsic quality of the portfolio in its better pricing, occupancy and merchandising power to sustain annual average NOI growth of 3%, even as we've achieved 95% leased. Second, profiting from our expertise to deliver annual average starts of $200 million of high-quality developments and redevelopments at attractive returns on invested capital. And third, maintaining a strong balance sheet that now compares favorably to other blue-chip companies, but costs effectively match-funding investments.","As we have shared with you the positive condition of the portfolio, development program and balance sheet has allowed us to pivot from being a net seller. Any further enhancements to the portfolio and balance sheet will be achieved organically and opportunistically. The progress on sustaining 3% NOI growth at 95% leased is evidenced by this quarter\u2019s double-digit rent growth. The underlying fundamentals not only remain strong, but are continuing to gain momentum. Our team is keenly focused on increasing the frequency and amount of rent steps, growing rents and moving the percent leased beyond 95%.","Their efforts in achieving NOI growth in excess of 3% for the third consecutive year and in the future of being aided by the historically low level of new supply, robust tenant demand and health and particularly the inherent quality of the portfolio. The development results in prospects continue to exceed our high expectations. Regency\u2019s ability to create exceptional centers in our target markets at meaningful margins to the cost of acquiring centers of comparable quality is a driver of significant value.","Despite an environment that remains supply constrained and intensely competitive we continue to win more than our fair share of a limited number of development opportunities that meet our high standards. Our success has allowed us to increase development start guidance for 2014. It is also worth noting that we have nearly $90 million of redevelopments in process and the potential to commence more than $50 million next year.","I now want to share some thoughts on how we are addressing the changing retail environment due to technology driven shifts in consumer behavior, demographics and alternative delivery channels, most particularly the rise of millennials, social networking and e-commerce. Due to the strength of the portfolio, particularly its demographics and anchor tenant sales, the recent elimination of virtually all of our weaker centers, the addition of many fabulous new centers including a meaningful amount now anchored by specialty grocers, like Whole Foods and Trader Joe\u2019s, and the necessity convenience orientation of the tenant mix, there are many reasons to believe that the portfolio should perform well in the changing environment.","At the same time, given the dramatic changes that are taking place, we\u2019re not going to stand still. We need to continually take a fresh look at our shopping centers and operating systems to ensure that we will have a portfolio that not only survives, but more importantly, thrives. Future developments, redevelopments, acquisitions and sales will continue to play a role in keeping our portfolio relevant. But also, key to this is Fresh Look, our three-pronged initiative that includes merchandising to best-in-class retailers and restaurants that are injecting more energy into our centers. And these retailers and restaurants are also effectively utilizing social media Internet strategies to drive sales, adding place-making features using architectural and design elements to make centers more inviting that increases the shopper dwell-time and connecting our retailers and our centers to our surrounding neighborhoods and communities. ","While we are still in the early innings with much to be accomplished our teams have really embraced this critically important issue. Brian will offer some examples of how Fresh Look has already positively impacted the portfolio. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","","Thank you Hap and good morning everyone. Financial results exceeded our expectations for the first quarter with core FFO of $0.69 per share and FFO of $0.71 per share. Operating percent leased declined by only 20 basis points since the end of the year as a result of lower than normal seasonal move-outs and it is up 60 basis points when compared to this time last year. Same-property NOI growth excluding termination fees was 2.9% for the quarter, driven primarily by higher base rent. This was achieved despite the increase in snow removal costs, resulting from that never ending winter which many of you experienced firsthand. But fortunately this increase in expenses was mostly offset by a resulting increase in tenant recoveries. However, without the resulting increase, net expense, it\u2019s important to note that same-property NOI growth would have been above 3%.","Quickly on G&A, the first quarter was slightly below expectations, due to the timing of capitalization related to development starts. We continue to anticipate finishing 2014 within our full year guidance range of $57.5 million to $60.5 million, which we initially introduced to you back in December. This implies a quarterly run rate of approximately $15 million. Turning to full year guidance, we increased core FFO per share by $0.02 on both ends. This change is primarily attributed to the delayed timing of dispositions. We also increased FFO per share guidance to a new range of $2.68 to $2.74. It now mirrors the range for core FFO per share as we recognized a gain in the first quarter on the sale of a parcel of land. This gain effectively offsets the other reconciling items between the two measures.","Operating results were generally in line with expectations for the first quarter, causing percent leased and full year NOI growth guidance to remain unchanged. As Hap said, due to the progress we made converting our development pipeline into starts and the heightened visibility of additional targeted developments and redevelopments, we increased our guidance for 2014 by $40 million. Consequently, we also increased disposition guidance by the same amount. We are highly confident that we will successfully execute match-funding of our development spend with dispositions of non-core assets. And as a reminder, our guidance doesn\u2019t assume any acquisitions should we acquire any additional centers, they will be done on a basis that is accretive to NOI growth and these will be funded with additional sales of lower growth assets with roughly comparable cap rates.","And as always, equity issuances will be considered as an alternative when our equity is favorably priced in relation to our view of NAV. Lastly, we plan to capitalize of what continuous to be a borrowers market, as we address our outstanding line balance in the April bond maturity. Included in our current projections is a $250 million bond issuance on which we have already hedged our base rate exposure. Brian?","Brian Smith","","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning everyone. As Lisa and Hap both said, momentum continued to accelerate through the first quarter of the year. What stands out most this quarter is that rent growth returned to double-digits at nearly 12%, moreover the strength was broad-based with positive growth in every market and with both anchors and shops contributing in a meaningful manner. This strength reinforces the fact that leasing leverage is in our favor and not only allows us to push starting rents but also to increase the amount and frequency of embedded rent steps. It also reflects our changing perspective on the move-outs, more than ever we welcome them as an opportunity to both upgrade our tenant mix and to drive rents.","While we did experience a seasonal decline in occupancy for the first quarter, it was well below historic norms especially for shop tenants whose move-outs were particularly low for a first quarter. This follows the record low level of shop move-outs for both the fourth quarter and for all of 2013. This trend has also continued into April and exemplifies the improvement of both the quality of the portfolio and the tenant base. And given the limited supply environment and robust demand for space, I am optimistic about the team\u2019s ability to drive the same-property portfolio beyond 95% leased. As Hap indicated, our Fresh Look initiative, which includes aggressive asset management focused specifically on merchandising, design and place making the shopper experience in connecting our centers to their communities, is starting to gain traction throughout the portfolio.","Our teams continue to find ways to improve our centers, making them unique and more exciting places to shop, thus enhancing the customer draw and resulting in better sales for our tenants. We have had much success adding best-in-class retailers, restaurants and high-end fitness facilities. For example, we are bringing Mendocino Farms, a highly successful gourmet sandwich and salad restaurant that currently has seven locations within the Los Angeles area for a center in West Lake Village, California. Mendocino Farms is not your typical sandwich shop, the restaurant offers farm to table seasonal\u2026","[Technical Difficulty]","(Operator Instructions)","During the first quarter, we opened Juanita Tate Marketplace in Los Angeles. The center's grocer, Northgate Gonzalez, described the store as an incredible success with the highest sales for first 10 days in their chain\u2019s history, the center is 98% leased. Finally all the recent development projects continue to demonstrate impressive results. Of the 11 projects started as of 2009 is since completed, seven are 100% leased and collectively the projects are more than 98% leased. This tremendous leasing progress combined with compelling returns reinforces our belief that right size and focused development makes a lot of sense, Hap?","Hap Stein","Thank you, Brian, thanks Lisa. I am extremely excited about the positive momentum being created from the underlying fundamentals, together with the quality of our portfolio, our value-add developments and redevelopments, the strength of our balance sheet, the talent and engagement of our management team and the industry leading operating systems like Fresh Look and Greengenuity. We thank you for your time and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Christy McElroy - Citi","","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Now that you closed on the Fairfield portfolio, can you talk about possible additional investment opportunities with Clayban? I know they own a lot in Fairfield County which is a target market for you for acquisitions.","","Hap Stein","Well we\u2019re all set up to do a lot more with them in a sense that on our existing properties we have a right of first refusal for the shopping centers that are up there, so if anything happens there, there is an opportunity for you to take advantage of that. In addition we are looking at various ways to add additional value to what we\u2019ve already done. We have, we know that in one of the centers there is an opportunity to eventually put together some space to create a specialty grocer who has been looking in that market for a long time. We can add -- we\u2019re looking to buy an adjacent property to one of the centers that would allow us to increase the density. And then there is some densification which we can do on the existing centers, including buying a pad, turning into a multi-tenant pad and adding to what we\u2019ve already got. And then to the extent they find that they\u2019re completely unrelated opportunity -- development opportunity we\u2019ve spoken about doing it together but we don\u2019t have anything lined up right now.","Christy McElroy - Citi","","And then Lisa, I'm not sure if I heard you correctly. I think you said that you would think about issuing equity if it was viewed favorably to NAV. What is your view of NAV today versus where the stock is?","Lisa Palmer","Christy that\u2019s not, that\u2019s a question you know that -- and the way we would think about it is, should we\u2019ve got nearly 20 plus analysts that cover us. And I would say consensus cap rate is sub six, so I think that that\u2019s probably a fair way to -- that certainly gets in the ballpark.","Christy McElroy - Citi","So you would think about issuing equity today where your stock is today or you would wait?","Lisa Palmer","If it was in -- with an applied cap rate of sub six, we certainly would be considering it and everybody is going to have different methods of valuing our developments and process and our third-party fees, but the majority of it is going to come from NOI.","Christy McElroy - Citi","Thanks Lisa.","Hap Stein","And it once again depends on use of funds and alternative sources.","Christy McElroy - Citi","Got you.","Hap Stein","We haven't issued equity to-date.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We ask that in the interest of time that you please also limit yourself to two questions before rejoining the queue to give everyone a chance to ask their questions. Our next question is coming from Jake Harlington of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Jake Harlington - Green Street Advisors","Great, thank you. Brian, you are one of the most active developers out there. And I wanted to get your thoughts on how you think about what type of grocer you are slotting in some of these new centers? And I ask because there is a ton of dislocation in the food retail market with traditional players and even some of the specialties. What drives your decision there? Is it primarily local demographics? Is it minimum productivity levels? And has that changed over last five years?","Brian Smith","It really, it's always been who is we think is the dominant grocer in the market as well as simply do the best leasing of first site shop tenants. So, if you look at what we've got this year, we may do, we're going to do seven or eight new developments, and I think we got five Whole Foods, two Trader Joe's and one Publix. so, there's a heavy spend this year towards Whole Foods and the specialty grocers, and I think that is a growing trend. If you look at our, excuse me, our portfolio since beginning of 2009, and you look at the rent that comes from shopping centers, anchored by specialty grocers it's gone from less than 10% to over 20%.","However, there are certainly markets where we would default to a non-specialty grocer or you look at Texas if you could Kroger or HEB. So, it really kind of depends, but at least, right now, we're doing more in the way of specialty grocers. In terms of all the developments, the redevelopments, that we either have under construction right now, or we have signed leases, but not yet under construction or that are in the pretty high probability pursuit category. There is about 29 grocers, and just a breakdown of those would be about nine Whole Foods, six Publix, four Kroger\u2019s and then some other smaller specialty grocers, like Fresh Market, Trader Joe\u2019s and alike.","Jake Harlington - Green Street Advisors","","Okay. And maybe just another development question, the East San Marco project -- I don't know if you talked about that one. But where does that one stand and have you said what the size of that one could be?","Brian Smith","Well, we control the property, we have for some time, and the retail has been ready to go. It would be a smaller version of Publix with some side shops, and what we're just waiting for is the residential which was originally planned to be condos and then of course that market tanked in late \u201908, and so now we're out vetting different residential developers for multi-family residential. We expect that that would start next year."," ","Jake Harlington - Green Street Advisors","Okay. And just lastly on the acquisition in Austin, 5.2 cap rates for it looks like a stabilized asset was that an off market purchase or was that a competitive bid process?","","Brian Smith ","That was fairly competitive. I would not call that one an off-market bid. No.","Hap Stein","And the thought process is low five as you may have indicated is low five cap rate with significant growth in that -- projected growth in excess of 3.5% and we're financing a significant portion of it by the sale of a CVS that has very-very flat rent and cap rate is going to be -- we think it's going to be sub five.","Jake Harlington - Green Street Advisors","Right.","Brian Smith","If you just put that perspective in that market, there was an HEB Steinmart property that traded about six months before or a few months before us in Austin and that was at a six, five IRR and this IRR was a growth, Hap just mentioned is north of seven.","Jake Harlington - Green Street Advisors","","Okay, thank you.","","Mike Mas","","Thank you, Jake.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Albert Lin - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Hi, guys. It is actually Albert Lin for Haendel. Following up on the development question, some of your peers have mentioned that overall rents haven't quite gotten up to the level to justify new development. So it seems like it would be even more important to pick your spots. You have a couple in California, a couple in Florida. So just wondering if there are any other locations you were looking at?","","Brian Smith","Well, we just finished a very large one up in the Pacific Northwest in Seattle. We're active in Northern California. We're active in Southern California. We're very active in Texas. We're active in the Carolinas. We're active in Florida and we're active in Chicago. ","Chris Leavitt","But as you said, you got to pick your spot and have the right corner with the right anchor tenant, that's going to, as Brian answered to attract the best-in-class side shop retailers, that'll make the developments pencil out as are the last 400 million that have been started have very well.","Albert Lin - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then a question on dispositions, we have heard the assets are getting better pricing than expected. But looks like dispositions were a little lighter this quarter for you guys. Curious on the strategy, if this a function of being a little bit aggressive and looking for the best price, which might be a change in mindset after all the assets that you already sold and you were more pressed to sell in the past?","Hap Stein","Well, let's start with your strategy question. So, we are pretty much through as we have talked about before, the sale of our lower-quality properties. But we still have a base plan of about $120 million, $125 million that we plan to sell this year, and the cap rates there are going to be in the 7% to 7.5% range. Now, we did not do very much first quarter, but that's not unusual at all. If you look at last year at this time, we had zero sales, and we ended that year greater than $300 million. So, we feel very confident that we're going to be within the range that we've set forth in our guidance.","The second prong of that strategy is to do the match-funding for acquisitions and there what we're going to do is take the, whatever we're buying, we want to go ahead and do dispositions of lower growth assets Hap alluded to a little bit earlier that would narrow the spread between the acquisition cap rates and the disposition cap rates. So, right now, with the property I mentioned that's under contract as well as Mira Vista, we've got about $45 million worth of match-funding to do and in one of the ones that would be a match-funding asset is that CBS and Washington DC, at sub 5%.","Albert Lin - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks.","Mike Mas","","Thank you.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sticking with development, last quarter you had talked about seeing some modest increases in develop -- competition for developments. I'm curious how that has trended over the last quarter? And then the other question is just on land side of things, just curious how big a barrier land availability is becoming for the types of developments that you are trying to accomplish?","Brian Smith","Well, in terms of the environment, Hap said it best we are getting more than our fair share of opportunities. We've got a big pipeline for this year. There is no reason to think that we won't continue to average somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 million a year, developments, redevelopments. I do think the environment meet the competition for land seems to have picked up. We haven't seen a whole lot more of the ground, but you're seeing the return of retailers like Target on more site plans. As we compete for properties, especially if there are mixed used sites, you see a lot of competition for them and that competition is getting more aggressive in terms of willing to close with a very short due diligence period, perhaps to that entitlement without an anchored tenant. But we haven't had to go there. We don't plan to go there, for whatever reason we're finding the opportunities. And in terms of the availability, where we've been looking, the more urban infill areas, that land has always been hard to find. And I think that really is one of the benefits and differentiating aspects of our team is the experience and the amount of time they have spent looking for those kind of assets and the relationships they have developed to get them.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","And can you just comment on how land prices in those kinds of markets have trended? Over the past year, say?","Brian Smith","The only place where we've seeing really significant increases in land prices would be in those markets that are very high and could go for any use and the two that come to mind would be Houston and San Francisco Bay Area, where to be able to do a single storey retail development is tough just given the land price and therefore instead you'll see a lot of multi-families. We're incredibly fortunate to have been able to develop the only two single storey retail properties in the Bay area that I know of with our Petaluma project which completed last year and in the double home we just announced this year. I mean, but those are the markets where land prices are really high because of the residential demand.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Mike Mas","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust","Just a quick one here, if I look at your total base rent, it is about $17.75. Could you provide an update on where you think that portfolio mark-to-market is today? And also how much TI\/leasing commission dollars per square foot do you project in your guidance for \u201914?","Hap Stein","See in terms of the rents, it's all going to depend on the mix whether it's the anchors or whatever, but if I look at the expiring rents and compare that to what we've signed in this past quarter, it would imply that in the anchors we could see about 40% growth on the stock much more reasonable more like 5%, 6%, 7%. So, just depending on what the mix is of anchors versus shops will depend, will dictate what that growth is, but the trend in rent growth as well as just the trend in the average base rents, both of them continue to be positive and we think that trend will continue.","Brian Smith","And the other thing that will have an impact on how much we can harvest is whether the anchor tenants, when their lease expires, even though they may be meaningfully below market, where they have additional term or additional options and unfortunately in often case they do have that.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust","And then just that second part of that question was your TIs. They seem to bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter which is completely understandable. What is embedded in your guidance, your TIs and estimated dollar per square foot prospectus?","Hap Stein","I'll let Brian just comment on the trends on TIs. I mean leasing commissions will be completely dependent on how much leasing we do. And I mean you can estimate that based on our percent lease guidance. From a TIs perspective we don't provide specific guidance for it, we obviously of course plan for it internally and we plan for it based on trends we're seeing. I'll let Brian talk to that.","Brian Smith ","Yes, if you just kind of look at the page 21 of our supplemental in terms of the committed TIs, they were down significantly and the total TIs were down over 30% and the new TIs really drove it being down 50%. Now, while the TIs remained below historical average or near it, the reason really for that big decrease is because we're giving it less often than we used to. I think we gave it 24% of the time versus 57% of the time this quarter, but what was really lying underneath that is that our redevelopments in Hinsdale in Chicago area, that was one of the Dominick's that left. And they sold that lease to Whole Foods which was great upgrade for us. But in that particular case, Whole Foods wanted to downsize, they didn't want to take the full size of that space.","So what they ended up doing is, keeping the rents where it was and they put in all the capitals. They put in the capitals to demise the space, to do new facades to separate utilities from mechanical systems. So we're basically getting a brand new Whole Foods space and we're getting a brand new 12,500 square foot space we can lease and probably rents would be twice as high as what they were and we're not putting a dollar into it. So I think that kind of drag that number down. Renewals, same thing, they're low, they're up a little bit this quarter but that was really due to just one lease and that was a 24 Hour Fitness in Southern California, it was only $10 square foot of TI. But because it such a large building, it really drove it up. If you subtract it out that one lease and you go to your supplemental page of $0.73 a square foot for renewals, that one lease taking out will reduce it to $0.41, so both all TIs are inline.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust ","Okay, thank you.","Mike Mas","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is coming from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Lisa, I think you mentioned earlier you're capitalizing more interest through G&A, at least through the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for capitalized interest for the year? And how you think about allocating that capitalized interest in between G&A and interest expense?","Lisa Palmer","First, let me clarify the prepared remarks. I was talking about capitalized development overhead not capitalized interest. And the development overhead, although it also relate to interest being a little bit early with the start of [indiscernible] place in the first quarter. That was what caused us to -- from a timing perspective, capitalized more earlier than originally planned. And in terms of the actual capitalized interests go back to our December guidance presentation; we actually did give guidance on what we expect to capitalize interest to be for the year. And that was 7 million to 8.5 million. And that simply just netted out of our growth interest expense.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","Okay, great. And can you just comment a little bit about the Fresh Look initiative and kind of how we should be thinking of that in terms of dollar spend and returns? And is it essentially just going into the redevelopment spends or how should we be think manager that from a dollars perspective and return perspective?","Brian Smith","Let me stress the philosophy you are asking about, first don't kind of get to the cost of newness. It's really just the philosophy of what we're doing. And that is -- as Hap mentioned, the world is rapidly changing, I read a quote that said, customers live in an ever-increasing sensory-stimulating world that elevates their requirements for uniqueness. And basically the millennial today are just saying, we hear this when we sit down with the retailers and we talk to them that newness is important, they want exciting, they want updated brand. They just don't want the same old, and they are impatient. They want immediate gratification, which includes customer service and just the whole experience they get. They are not anti bricks and mortar, they are comfortable in both the real world, additional world, but if you're going to bring them to your centers, you got to make it as fresh and exciting as you can.","So with that in mind, there is three prongs to get to improving that experience. One is the merchandising where we want to attract, really we want to attract the best tenants we can for the center whether that's one of our higher end centers or our bread and butter, expand the trade area with them, and therefore attract other better retailers, attract more traffic, which would grow sales, which would create a virtuous cycle that'll lead to higher NOI.","And we've got lots of examples of that; we got in our Westlake development, Le Pain Quotidien, Pitfire Pizza there, Mendocino Farms we talked about. We talked about in the call Bartaco. So part of part of this merchandising, the second part is twice making it. We just want to make it a more inviting experience. You know this was a center you like to go to, you like to kind of just hang out there versus the ones you can't wait you to kind of get in and out because shopping done.","And then the third thing we just speak connecting to the community and that can be technology with a social media the like, or it can just having the kind of tenants and having the kind of design that allows for things like sponsoring a 5K race. One of our tenants at Cameron Village is a fitter store, and they work these post work up pub crawlers with all of the restaurants and everything, so that's kind of theory. In terms to the cost the cost really having proving to be an issue yet. If you look at that Bartaco deal that we talked about in Atlanta, the return cost for doing that deal was over 10%, about 10.5%.","If you look at Westlake village there is really four of these transformational tenants that we brought and the TIs are $25 to $30 per square foot. But including that $25 to $30 per square foot are money there are going to have to spend to do work that we would normally do. For example, we did not deliver restrooms or lighting. The restaurants want to provide their own restrooms and lighting. So that brings your TIs down to more like the $15 square foot range, which is very, very typical of what we do.","I do think with these kinds of attention you can expect that TIs will go up somewhat, but again we're not going to do it unless we think the overall impact is going to be raise NOI for the entire center. And then I would say in terms of cost for each individual center, if it is a redevelopment, it's going to be part of redevelopment cost, where it's no part of redevelopment, I think expense on the centers, some centers might be $100,000 and others it could be as low as $10,000. So it's really going to depend on which profits we are talking about.","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","Thanks for that color. I appreciate it.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Sullivan of Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen","","Good morning. Thank you. Hap, this is really a question for you, I think. The spread between your stabilized development yield and acquisition cap rate is pretty wide. And is suggesting that the margin, in terms of value creation in the development pipeline is maybe as wide as it has ever been for Regency, I don't know. Strikes me that over 30% is a pretty wide margin. I'm just curious as you think about that, are you tempted to drop the hurdle rate on development? I know that you haven't done so far. It has been pretty disciplined. How do you think about the potential for doing that, given the demand for quality product in the investor market?","Brian Smith","Obviously, if we can -- developing in a urban infill location, the going in return maybe justified at a lower rate than if you're developing what I might call a suburban infill or part of the planned unit development. And that spread could be, you know were supposed to in this more suburban location, like Cinco Ranch, which has been a highly successful, Kroger anchor development in the fastest growing planned unit development in the country, that's going to end up being a 9% initially underwrote it to 8%. We can get into the mid sevens, possibly even a little bit lower on a risk adjusted basis for the right kind of development in the right location, where we do think that we're creating substantial value Jim. So that is, that does from risk, location, market comes into the equation as we look at trying to evaluate, which appropriate as far as developing a shopping center with the returns that we need and the margins we like to have.","Hap Stein","Joe, if I can just amplify in that, we had discussions within the last couple of days about mix used project, where we'd be -- we'd have to retail to ground floor of multi-family. In that particular case, you're talking urban as you can get, downtown of a major city and the multi-family developer would deliver the completed shell, have taken all the risks on the entitlements. Basically it's an acquisition with you just finishing up the small shops, which aren't that great. In that case, we view this having, it is being very desirable with the lot less risk, in that case we would go to a lower cap rate.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen","Interesting. Looking at your tenant list, obviously your combined exposure to Safeway and Albertsons is very significant. And assuming the transaction that has been where the pricing has been agreed to, when it goes through at the end of the year. I would assume given the significant overlap between the two retailers, particularly in the West Coast markets, I'm assuming there would we be the likelihood of significant divestitures or store closings assumed. You are coming up to the ICSC later this month. Is this a topic of conversation with those specialty grocers who are looking to break in and expand in those markets and might not have any choices? Is there a buzz out there, that there is going be some significant opportunity space opening up as a result of that merger?","Brian Smith","Yeah, absolutely, and it's not just because of this. I mean, we've all known for a long time that certainly Albertsons and Safeway have had their struggles, and I know probably two years ago, we talked to a one of the specialty grocery chains about all of our Albertsons Holdings in Southern California, and at that time they said that they would be definitely interested in taking a couple and probably interested in taking several more. So, we know that interest is there, the specialty grocers are having a tough time finding opportunities and this will be good way to do it. In terms of the potential closures, following along that theme that we have been anticipating it, since 2009, we have 28 -- we disposed of our released 28 Albertsons and Safeway across the country. ","So, I think we\u2019ve gotten out ahead of it. And those that we\u2019ve kept are the kind we think we can replace with our better operators as we did with the five Dominick's in Chicago and they ran as you may recall in our redevelopment in Huston where we got a 150% rent growth, with Whole Foods and then Mariano taking with the Roscoe in Chicago. So short-term, we don't expect there's going to be much change. Some of markets, where we have no overlap really to speak of, when you think about Washington DC and the Northern California and Texas and where we do have stores in those markets, we've got replacements already calling us. We are very interested in going.","If Southern California was really your question and set Northwest for this overlap, we went through them space by space and we feel really good about our real estate, particularly, I think, Safeway. We think there may be a handful of the stores where because of overlap they could close. We certainly don't know, but it is just a handful and of the ones we think there is some potential risk, which really key is, you have a right to recapture the space and looking at both the Safeway and the Albertsons similar situations, there is only one lease where we don't have the right to recapture. So we think bad news will turn into good news.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen","Great. Okay, guys. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Mueller - JPMorgan","Hi, when you are looking at this quarter leasing spreads, just wondering, were there any significant geographical variances? And how sticky to you think they will be as you move throughout the year?","Brian Smith","Well, it's not so much the geographical differences as it is big leases drive. So if you look at our rent growth, it was good and that was despite the fact we had two anchored tenants that were new -- one was the new, one was the renewal lease at zero rent growth. So and we have one that was renewal to almost 30% down. So, despite those three drags, it was still good rent growth. On the other hand, we did have a large tenant in Washington DC as part of redevelopment, there was an old-old lease for carrying down or expanding it and there is about 240% rent growth from that one and we had another one in the Pacific Northwest. So, we had two leases that really drove it to the positive and then we had two that held it flat and one that drove it down. And that's really summarizing it.","Mike Mueller - JPMorgan","Okay, so nothing really -- if you are saying the Southeast compared to the West Coast or anything like that?","Hap Stein","I guess, Brian indicated, we had good rent growth throughout in every market and small shop and anchor tenants.","","Brian Smith","Yes, I mean it really was broad-based, all markets had rent growth, I think ten of them had double-digit rent growth and then the shops rent growth was almost double-digits too it was 9.8%.","Mike Mueller - JPMorgan","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.","Mike Mas","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to make sure I understood from your earlier comments in your prepared remarks. It sounds like the bankruptcy outlook for the year is pretty benign? And with that the outlook for bad debt expense probably pretty benign as well?","Brian Smith","Bankruptcies have been partly anything, this quarter we had the Quiznos and the Dots and Ashley Stewart, Ashley Stewart really had one of them and that is one of our premier properties in Northern California. We've already got two tenants to take that space, the Dots is only six locations and Quiznos we've known for some time, and have been working to release those. And in both cases the Dots and the Quiznos, the vast majority, vast majority of those are A properties and we've already released the lowest quality of each one of those. So, we just don't see any issue there at all.","","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then the same thing, go ahead sorry.","Lisa Palmer","I was just going to average for the actual bad debt expense. I mean last year was a pretty healthy year for bad debt expense as well and we would expect that to continue. I think we finished the year in less than 50 basis points and gave guidance that this year should be at least equal or better to that. And when you look at our accounts receivable that are outstanding greater than 90 days we're at 0.5% of revenues, which is the lowest that we've been for as long as I can remember, I mean even going back to 2007 we're 0.7, 0.8, 0.9.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks Lisa. And then as you guys think about the other side, the store closing side, you\u2019re talking a little bit about small shop closings being, small shop move-outs being very light. I mean, do you see the retention, I guess, you want to call it that retention ratio of guys who's leases are expiring, staying high where it is or getting some deterioration there?","Brian Smith"," ","Well, the move-outs as I said in the prepared remarks are remarkably note that the best first quarter we've ever had for shop move-outs following fourth quarter being the best quarter ever of all quarters and 2013 being the lowest of any year. So, we're feeling really good about that and that's despite some pretty aggressive proactive move-outs that we've been, we've got.","If you think about some of the aggressive things we're doing, one of them is we're not renewing a lot of tenants. I mean if you think about some of the ones we did this year, this last quarter, we've got that for Taco deal that was previously leased by a national tenant, who wanted to renew, but we had built into their lease, and clause require them to renovate their space, when they didn't do it, we refuse to renew them. ","We had another situation, we've got Loehmann's Plaza up in Atlanta, where we're doing a complete renovation, we are replacing Loehmann's with a specialty grocer. We're replacing OfficeMax with a really neat tenant, it's not signed yet, so I won't mention who it is. So, with that in mind, we had a tenant that want to renew and we said no. We know we can do better. They actually hired an attorney, try to find a landlord default to force us to, to keep them and they couldn't do it. So we got rid of that. So, we've got lots of these examples of being very aggressive in terms of our asset management and not allowing tenants to renew or terminating them when we see the AR start to increase.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets"," ","Great thank you, guys.","Mike Mas","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Samir Khanal of ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Samir Khanal - ISI Group","Hey, good morning. I know we've talked quite a bit about traditional specialty grocers but just want to get your view on something here. How much of a cap rate differential do you think there is between centers with traditional grocers today versus one with maybe a specialty grocer and it's sort of all else being equal, I just want to kind of get your thoughts on that.","Brian Smith","I don't think it's necessarily whether it's specialty or not, it's how good the grocer is. I mean, if you got a Kroger on a lease, you got Publix, you got a H.E.B, you're going to have good cap rate. But I will say that, for example, our Shops on Main outside of Chicago, in fact we're adding a Whole Foods to that center, I think it's going to change the cap rate probably 50 basis points across the whole center. So, the specialty grocers particularly the Whole Foods, just have so much cache, there is a lot for your properties but really high a quality traditional grocery well as well.","Hap Stein","The issue is though is they typically Trader Joe's and Whole Foods productivity is so high. So we do have a lot of number of H.E.Bs that are doing comparable quality, comparable sales in Publix's and Kroger's. And when that is the case, that shows the strength of the location and as Brian indicated, you'll get the comparable cap rate.","Samir Khanal - ISI Group","","Great, thanks.","","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","","Hi. Jeremy Metz on for Ross. Can you guys just talk about what kind of growth or value add and redevelopment opportunities you're underwriting right now that gives you comfort buying at these peak evaluations we're seeing?","Brian Smith","Well the redevelopment we separate from the decision to buy some of these acquisitions we're doing. The acquisitions what we're looking for would be best infill markets with the dominant grocers, high barriers to entry, excellent demographics that provide superior growth.","If you've looked at the Fairfield portfolio or Mira Vista, there's good growth in there, and they check all the boxes on everything else I just mentioned. The redevelopments are generally within our operating portfolio and there we, there is a couple things going on, we can take a center that where we may tear down the whole center and go ahead, or part of it, and rebuild and expand the anchors like we did in Village centers in Tampa where we built a brand new expanded Walgreens and brand new expanded Publix. Or it could just a renovation of the entire center where you may replace the grocer as we're going to do with whole foods, replacing a Dominick's or Mariana's replacing a Dominick's. Or they could just be Phase IIs or expansions of GOA, or previously developed properties.","So one way or another, we are adding values to a center that's already there versus the acquisitions where we're buying the value based on growth.","Hap Stein","And I would add that, Jeremy. I think that, what you've probably seen over the past year or so for the assets that are being competitively bid, with Mira Vista being an exception. Assets that are being competitively bid, not only Regency, but many of our publicly traded peers aren't necessarily winning those. For those that don't have some type of value add opportunity. And because the pension funds cost of capital and the other private equity is just a lot more aggressive right now. But for those opportunities, where there is a value ad, I think you're seeing Federal and Equity One and Regency be a more often successful on those. And then it maybe our relationships that come into play, that one might get the edge over the other and to give the example of -- it was a couple of years ago at this point. But Balboa is a San Diego acquisition. And we had a relationship with CBS and we're able to have a conversation prior to going higher on the contract that gave us the comfort that we were going to be able to complete that redevelopment, whereas a private equity buyer was not able to do that. So I do think that there's some of that happening and that we are looking at acquisitions that way as well.","Brian Smith","But in acquisition that doesn't have a redevelopment opportunity. We are not doing unless the growth is substantial, 3% plus and unless we're confident that we can do a trade and a roughly comparable cap rate and the asset that we're selling as meaningfully flatter growth profile. So that is -- in our view is a good trade. The IRR on what we're buying because of the growth is going to be higher than the IRR in what we're selling.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","Yes. And then I think that's right. If you're buying a 97% leased asset, kind of five cap I mean, they are just getting much embedded, you only have what's embedded there. So there just stays in a high growth pro forma necessarily. As a second question, just wondering on the selling side, have you seen any change in the buyer pool for non-core assets you're selling, more private equity institutional interest driving tighter pricing as some of the As become harder to acquire?","Brian Smith","Yes. I mean, I'd say again that the average cap rate out there is, for A quality properties in the good markets with growth and all is low to mid 5s, but I think your -- I've seen another transcripts, there's the property that we looked at and actually try to buy long ago, 10 years ago in Reston, Virginia, that thing set a new low in terms of cap rates. My understanding is, it's somewhere in the low-fours with IRR about six. So the -- but the end pricing has been tight and it's because we all know there's very, very, very little product that comes to market, and there's huge demand.","The C market, there's always been an interest in that, because there's a lot of people, who believe the dream that they can create the value to turn that thing around. It's the B pricing, I think, where we've seen the most tightening, and I think that's mostly spill-over for the lack of products available for the As. So I think the cap rates are tightening for the B property, although, that's being offset little bit by the fact that there's quite a bit of product available there. So that's sort of holding in the check.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tammi Fique of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Tammi Fique - Wells Fargo","","Hi. Most of my questions have been answered, but last quarter you mentioned comfort that leased rates at the end of the year would be towards the high-end of the guidance range. Are you still comfortable with that today?","","Brian Smith","Sure. I'll take it. I mean, we did not change our guidance. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, our seasonal move-outs were the lowest that they've been in quite some time. So we are still very comfortable with our guidance, and would expect that we should end the year towards the higher end of the range.","","Tammi Fique - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then with regard to acquisitions, maybe just turning back to that for a minute; you have identified a couple of acquisitions that you are looking at today. But maybe beyond that, do you have a pipeline of opportunities? Are there any portfolios or opportunities within your existing JV's to acquire those interests?","Brian Smith","We're always looking at everything, but I would say right now the pipeline is fairly thin as I mentioned about it. About a $100 million we've identified is having a reasonable chance of seeing them happen. And again that's going to depend on our ability not only to negotiate a favorable deal for us, but also to be able to match funded. There is plenty of other things we're looking at, but most of them just don't meet our criteria for growth. ","Lisa Palmer","And on the partnership side, there's really very little opportunity. There are partners, are generally either at or under allocated to core retail. If anything they'd probably like to add to that? Okay, yes, disposing of property doesn't necessarily fit their objectives?","Tammi Fique - Wells Fargo","Okay and then maybe just one last one, sort of turning back to the decisions to sell assets versus issue equity. Is that just really dependant on where the stock is, when you're finding acquisition opportunities or is there one you'd be more inclined to do versus the other?","Brian Smith","We balance what we want to -- when we think about selling, with where the stock pricing might be trading and with the investment opportunity might be, and we look at all those considerations, all I can say is that to date, first part of the year we haven't -- we were basically relying to date totally on our asset sales. We just -- last year we did a mix. ","","Tammi Fique - Wells Fargo","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Chris Lucas of Capital One. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Lucas - Capital One","Lisa and Mike, thank you very much for the enhanced presentation and disclosure detail in the supplement; that\u2019s very helpful. First question really relates to just the leasing environment. Brian, I guess just thinking about how you have described the activity between the better lease-spreads and just a larger development redevelopment pipeline that you guys are envisioning, in terms of the starts for this year. The question I'm wondering about is, is there a tangible change in the retailers perspective? Is there a greater sense of urgency to get deals done now, and say, even 90 days ago. Are you getting that feeling?","Brian Smith","I think we\u2019ve felt that for a while. There is clearly a sense of urgency. I think -- whatever thing I am hearing, I was on the phone speaking with Michael Niemira, the Chief Economist for ICSC and he was talking about factors. The reason I called him, there is so many studies out there on move outs and store closings and everything, what was his take on it. And his view is that, while the store closings have hedged up that the new demand from the retailers up in more stores is outpacing it and the debt trend is widening. So there is just a real difficulty in the retailers getting quality stores in the kind of locations they want. I think you've seen in our development pre-leasing. So there is a sense of urgency, because they're just not finding the stores.","Chris Lucas - Capital One","And then, Lisa, a question for you related to real estate expenses, the tax side. Are you seeing pressure now in some of the states that have seen a significant rebound in value like Texas, Florida, and California in your portfolio in terms of the real estate taxes that you're being assessed?","Lisa Palmer","I mean, obviously, as you know they were much lower last year. So, anything we would see increases, but nothing that would materially affect our numbers, not yet anyway.","","Chris Lucas - Capital One","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to add my appreciation, as well, for the improved disclosure. One more question. On the in-process developments, when you say it\u2019s 86% leased and committed, does that mean the rents associated with that are already in our numbers? Or the rents are still yet to come when the centers open up?","Lisa Palmer","It's generally. They would generally fall in the prelease bucket. Part of our disclosure we did actually, we're now disclosing, we call that percent comment. And that's kind of the proxy if you will between what's the difference between those that are rent paying versus not rent paying. And a lot of that prelease will fall in as a result of our ground-up developments as well as our redevelopments.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate everybody's participation in the call. I apologize for any technical difficulties that occurred, and wish that you have a great rest of the week. Thank you.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Mas. Thank you, you may begin.","Mike Mas","Good morning and welcome to Regency's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer our President and Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Executive Vice President of Development; Jim Thompson, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we begin, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. More information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in Company documents filed with the SEC.","Further with respect to our supplemental disclosure, please note the change in presentation of certain financial statements which now reflect updated SEC guidelines on pro-rata disclosure. Finally, we request the callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call to allow everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our best-in-class team continues to perform at a high level executing on our tried and true strategy that has consistently delivered impressive results in every facet of our business.","First, our operating portfolio, which by all relevant measures, is recognized as one of the best in the industry, is nearly 96% leased. This was achieved in the phase of recent bankruptcies and anchor move-outs and shop leasing remains vibrant and move-out louder.","Further, the anchor vacancies present our team with opportunities for upgrades over the prior tenants. Our development and redevelopment pipeline is looking even more visible. Further positioning us to deliver on an average of more than $200 of annual new starts of high quality shopping centers at very attractive returns.","Third, reinforced by our recent capital market's activity over the past few months, we will benefit from a sector-leading balance sheet that affords us complex ability to capitalize on compelling investment opportunities and whether and even profit from future disruptions in the capital markets.","And finally our talented and B team is focused on executing our proven business model that capitalizes on this distinguishing assets and in turn creating shareholder value, consistent gains and core earnings and net asset value per share.","Mac Chandler will now provide an update on development. Mac?","Mac Chandler","Thanks Hap, and good morning.","Despite a highly competitive development landscape, Regency's industry leading development team continues to source and execute on compelling opportunities while enhance our high quality portfolio.","Our newest start, the Village at Tustin Legacy is evidenced of our ability to extract significant value within our target markets resulting from a sharp shooter advantage. This ground-up development is located in the highly affluent in Orange County within the master plan community of Tustin Legacy.","The project will benefit from in place and growing triggers and graphics including a population of 200,000 and average income of than 100,000. You can see this in our previous as we are already 80% leased and committed after only three months of site construction.","I\u2019m confident in high caliber retailers and distinctive fresh look design that will enhance Regency\u2019s already from your presence in Orange County.","Before turning over the call to Lisa, I wanted to touch on future development expectations. With good visibility into our fourth quarter start of what we will be an exceptional Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack anchor development in the Northeast, and great or better on several other projects in our pipeline. We have raised the top end of our portfolio development guidance to 265 million.","It looks like this momentum will continue into 2017 which will result in another year of delivering high quality developments and redevelopment at substantial spreads to where these projects were trade. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Mac. Good morning all.","We continue to demonstrate the inherent strength of our high quality portfolio despite the headwinds from previously announced bankruptcies. The same property portfolio is 96% leased with shop space again contributing gains and nearing an impressive 93% leased.","Same-property NOI growth for the quarter was just under 3% moderating as we expected and also as we communicated on the last earnings call but still a very strong 3.4% year-to-date. Further with more visibility into the fourth quarter, we tightened the same-property NOI guidance range with a new range of 3% to 3.4%.","It is important to note however that we\u2019ll continue to absorb the impact from bankrupt tenants in the fourth quarter and also in the first half of 2017 as we work to release these anchor boxes.","Given this impact while I am not offering formal guidance at this time, it is reasonable to expect 2017 same-property NOI growth to more closely approximate growth from the latter half of this year.","I did want to provide more detail behind our rent growth for this quarter. We executed a short term anchor renewal with ongoing landlord recapture rates at our recent Market Common acquisition. This will allow us to significantly upgrade the merchandizing upon expiration or recapture of additional space and further by taking this course of action we\u2019re able to preserve income in the near term for a tenant that we had underwritten to base rate.","We may take control of the space and we will be able to improve the future growth profile of the center. We do not feel landlord leverage softening at our centers. Even after the impact from this strategic renewal, total rent growth year-to-date is approaching 11%. Additionally our new shop rent growth remained very strong at 14% for the quarter.","Overall the leasing environment remains healthy and with our premier real estate and with limited supply, we continue to able to push rents and negotiate mid-term rent steps to solidify embedded growth.","I\u2019ll conclude by touching on the updated guidance ranges for NAREIT and core FFO. With more certainly surrounding bankruptcies and move-outs we increased the low end of both ranges by $0.03 and raised the top end of these by a penny.","Thank you for listening. We now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Metz from UBS. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hi guys, good morning. You talked about more visibility on the development front and you obviously took the high end of your development starts up and you mentioned you're thinking your private seller level in 2017. Are you more broadly seeing any bigger shifts in tenant mindset towards new development at this point?","Mac Chandler","This is Mac Jeremy. I wouldn't say a different set of mindset. I think it\u2019s been consistent over the last several years we\u2019ve had a very healthy pipeline working with best-in-class tenants like Wegmans, Whole Foods, Publix, Kroger and our pipeline historically and when we look out forward it's filled with projects like that.","So we have opportunities every broadcast but we haven\u2019t seen a shift in the quality of the projects or the location. It seems to be really consistent with our strategy historically we\u2019re going forward. So no broad shifts there.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then just on the shop leasing, we've heard about some of the fast casual dollar stores are pairing back openings. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the ground there and the leasing front of that segment. Maybe how much higher you think you can drive that 93% in the next 12 to 18 months?","Jim Thompson","Jeremy, it's Jim Thompson. Obviously we\u2019re seeing very robust small shop leasing. We expect there is still some runway there. We're seeing continued good growth. I think the sectors that continue to be active are the fitness, the food although there is some saturation in that category we\u2019re seeing the new been replacing old and it\u2019s kind of a normal cycle.","We\u2019re aligning ourselves as we always do with who we consider the best-in-class in that sector and continuing to freshen the portfolio.","Jeremy Metz","Just, sorry just -- in terms of how much more you can even get out of that 93% increase, can we go to 94% to 95% here?","Jim Thompson","We try - as hard as we can but\u2026","Lisa Palmer","I trained Jim, well he is not going to give you a formal \u2013 we've talked about this before, the quality of our portfolio is so much better today than it was ten years ago. And ten years ago we reached just north of 92% on the shop space percent leased. We're obviously north of that today. So it's really uncertain, but we continue to see strong demand for the space and even more importantly over the past, really two years the number of move-outs in our small shop space continued to decline as a percent of space, right.","This year we\u2019re projecting move-outs of just about a million square feet and - which is almost - it\u2019s a little bit higher than last year, but that's almost offer for anchors. I mean our move-outs out in the small shop space is so small.","So as long as we can continue to do some new leasing, I would expect that we're going to continue to see that small shop lease tick up.","Jim Thompson","And the focus is not just on filling the space, but it\u2019s also on a quality of tenant and the merchant - new ability to merchant - as a merchant.","Jeremy Metz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Christy McElroy from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on that question, Lisa, I think you mentioned shop rent growth of about 14% in Q3, or that might have been the year-to-date number. As you, you know, get close to that 93% number and potentially beyond, presumably you're getting to some of that tougher lease space. What should we expect in terms of potential impact of that on releasing spreads as you see -- you've said you're likely to go higher.","Lisa Palmer","This is a great question Christy, and that\u2019s why it becomes a lot harder to project. But with the limited supply in the environment and with the quality of our portfolio in the high percent lease even with that being potentially lower quality space, we still anticipate that leverages more in outcome and then and there. So we still believe that even with that we should continue to see high single-digits to low double-digit rent growth moving forward.","Jim Thompson","And those rents in those spaces were starting from a lower based, so\u2026","Christy McElroy","Okay. Then in thinking about that decelerated pace of same store growth into 2017 that you talked about, presumably that's predominately impacted by some of the re-tenanting that you're doing with the stores that's already in other boxes. How should we think about this trajectory? Should that pace be slower in the first half versus the second half as you're replacing some of that down time and re-leasing that space? How should we think about that pace?","Lisa Palmer","Absolutely, because if you think about when those came offline, we had a lot of that income in the first half of the year. And assuming we are able to release those relatively quickly, even if we do that, we still were getting some until the latter half of the year, so the first half will certainly be lower than the second half of next year.","Mac Chandler","[Indiscernible] in timing - and finding better tenants to fill the spaces.","Christy McElroy","Okay. So that is the biggest impact? There's not anything else in there we should be thinking about in terms of drivers?","Lisa Palmer","No.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","Yes, I wanted to get your opinion on Lidl, the German discounter. From their point of view it sounds like they are trying to make a pretty aggressive push into the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic. On the other hand, when I talk to people on the ground, they seem somewhat skeptical. What's your take on their entry into the U.S.?","Mac Chandler","Craig, this is Mac. We have seen some evidence on the ground, either on ground expanding and they\u2019re well capitalized and appear to have a very aggressive appetite. But they're also quite secretive at the same time. So you don\u2019t see a lot of broad announcements as to where they\u2019re going. We haven't talking to them, about one type that we own in the City of Texas and the conversations ebb and flow as they with any other retailer.","So I think there is quite a bit of room before we can really give you on assessment of how they are as a competitor and a threat, and a player, but clearly they are making some moves here and they're trying to do it in a big way. That's about as much as a big return. Jim anything to add?","Jim Thompson","That\u2019s really - we know they're tied up in and have purchased sites. They really haven\u2019t opened anything yet. So it\u2019s very difficult, but they\u2019re clearly our force overseas, so they are an operator.","Craig Schmidt","Okay.","Hap Stein","And I think if you look to the Fresh & Easy history, as Mac said, this is too early for us to project out all our GAAP results, because I think they all thought they would do well prior to opening because you heard about how they did their market research and they had their people living in the U.S. and studying consumer behavior and something it's just unknown of how that will translate to hear.","Mac Chandler","The only I might add is their model is more about all the model, which is very low price, high value and that typically hasn't affected us as much as some of the higher end or mid-market groceries. We're just in more affluent higher locations so in that sense, they\u2019re something to keep.","Craig Schmidt","I guess I tend to lean toward that view. When I look at what's happening in the U.K. and some of the established supermarkets there, how they've been impacted by their reach into that country, I just wanted to hear what you were thinking, so thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Carlington from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jay Carlington","Good morning, guys. Just to go back to the leasing spreads we're beating up here a little bit. Is there any noise in there, whether it's from re-tenanting in the sports stores or anything? Because it seems like a decent pull and trying to get a handle on the sequential deceleration we've seen over the past couple of quarters there.","Hap Stein","You mean beyond what we mentioned in the prepared remarks?","Jay Carlington","Correct. Yes, the 5A, the mid single digit range that we see versus the low double digits the last couple of quarters. It's a decent pull, so I'm trying to get a sense if there's any -- if the rent increases that you're pushing through just aren't as aggressive any more.","Lisa Palmer","No, I mean I would again just reiterate what we did say in the prepared remarks, that when you do exclude that one lease that had a pretty significant impact. So when you do exclude that then we are in the double-digits for rent growth.","So that\u2019s \u2013 I mean I think that\u2019s you can\u2019t just ignore that and that was a strategic renewal, newly acquired property that we had underwritten to vacate and we felt really good about being able to reserve some of the income in the short-term while we worked to capture some of the other space back, so we can remerchandize a larger portion of the center. So I think that that\u2019s really important.","And beyond that, I think it\u2019s also important to know the actual absolute, so it\u2019s a mix as it often is the absolute rent for our leases that we sign this quarter. I think it\u2019s the highest in 12 months. If \u2013 I am not looking at the supplemental, if I recall correctly, I think the rent was $24 and last quarter it was a little low $20 again from memory, but that\u2019s still much higher than we\u2019ve seen. So it is a little bit of mix issue as well.","Jay Carlington","Okay. I probably missed that in the prepared. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Is there any sense -- I know the retailers don't give you sales but is there a sense of what their OCRs look like today versus a couple of years ago?","Lisa Palmer","We really don\u2019t get a lot of sales data, I mean I looked at Jim or Mac for just maybe any informal feedback that they\u2019re receiving in the field, but we don\u2019t have that many tenants that report. So those \u2013 that do typically tend to be the anchors and we\u2019re seeing them continue to have even our grocers have healthy...","Jim Thompson","Pretty healthy growth here.","Lisa Palmer","Yes, a healthy sale increases.","Jim Thompson","I think you could see in the renewals, if tenants weren\u2019t able to absorb their rent, they wouldn\u2019t be able to exercise their renewals that they are. They feel confident about their business, so they can make the ratios work and that\u2019s probably the best way to see it play out.","Hap Stein","And you see pick up and move out.","Jay Carlington","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Going back to your development-start guidance, it's a pretty wide gap. What is the two large processes that you're contemplating and when you said next year might look very similar to this year? Does that mean the midpoint, or the range should be similar next year, as well?","Lisa Palmer","Ki Bin, I\u2019m going to repeat the question to Mac, I think he might have been distracted for one second. He makes sure that in about the wide range of development starts and what was that we had this year that is causing that to be a wide range?","Ki Bin Kim","Yes.","Mac Chandler","Really the big difference between this quarter and prior ones is we\u2019ve been presented with an opportunity in the Northeast, very compelling opportunity, where an owner of the site has been working on it for 15 years entitling it. It\u2019s really all about the five yard line and just about done. And we have an opportunity that we will really like to be able to step into and shuffle ready project if you would, that\u2019s 50% preleased.","So we don\u2019t have 100% visibility to it occurring this calendar year, but it looks very positive and we want to make sure our guidance included that if it were to close this calendar year. Going forward to 2017, I\u2019d say the range is similar with previous years of 125 \u2013 225, but we would like $200 million, we would like to get it up to $300 million if we can find that right compelling opportunities that meet our disciplined approach. So that\u2019s really the change behind this quarter.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just a quick question on market rent growth, do you have a sense of, not leasing spreads, but what market rent growth has done in your portfolio in 2016, and maybe if you have a forecast of what you think market rent growth would be in 2017?","Hap Stein","It\u2019s been pretty modest market rent growth has been and I think our expectation is for to continue especially for high quality premier shopping centers.","Jim Thompson","If you just look at basically the act like the absolute dollars for rents that we\u2019ve signed, I mean we are looking at double-digit increases. But again think about the universe of shopping centers and what a small percentage are owned by REITs. Those REITs ownerships tend \u2013 the own the highest quality and then the higher quality REITs owned the higher quality of the high quality.","So I think what we\u2019re seeing in our centers may not be a very good proxy for the entire market, so we do continue to see really healthy growth and again it comes back to 96% REITs when almost 93% REITs on our shop space. We have leverage and we\u2019ll continue to arrive that while we have it because we know that it\u2019s not going to last forever.","Ki Bin Kim ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hoglund from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Hoglund","Good morning. Just wondering if you can comment on any recent trends in construction costs, how are they trending on a year-over-year basis?","Mac Chandler","Hi, George, this is Mac. So we watch it carefully and we\u2019ve seen some of these changes and anticipated them. So we have been fortunate that our development budgets have all held. But we are seeing changes of say 3% to 6% depending on the market and really tied mostly to a shortage in high skilled labor, and that seems to be a common thread throughout. But I think we\u2019re underwriting it appropriately, and we have been surprised by too much. But we always underwrite at inflation and escalation factor for projects that we know we\u2019re going to start several years out. Hopefully that helps.","George Hoglund","And geographically, are you seeing any significant differences?","Mac Chandler","Certainly the coastal markets, the increases are more. Seattle is the market probably only \u2013 certainly one of the top two or three house markets that could be little bit over there. San Francisco and certainly, Silicon Valley, actually there is a sort of big one. We\u2019re not in New York metros, but I would imagine that playing out as well.","George Hoglund","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Good morning, everyone. The follow-up question on Ki Bin's question about the development starts. Is there a discrete number of projects that get you to the high end? I'm trying to understand what the scale or the likelihood is as we think about year-end starts?","Hap Stein","Sure. Chris, there are three projects that we\u2019re counting out that are ground up projects. We think we\u2019re all going to happen, but we can\u2019t say for sure because fixed development and there is some intergradient to actually come together here in the next month. But the one that we added is about 70 million that should give you some guidance.","There is another one anchored by White Mint that we mentioned, we\u2019re working on and third one anchored by Krogers. So there are three significant sized projects, certainly $70 million is little bit bigger than typical one.","Jim Thompson","There is a one \u2013 it\u2019s not widely that they won\u2019t happen. There may be a decent change they can get twist into first quarter of 2017. No guarantees they are going to happen for sure, but we feel very, very confident that that\u2019s going to happen. It is development, but that can be get pushed into 2017.","Chris Lucas ","Yes, and is that the timing issue regulatory-driven? Government approvals, or is there something else that may be impacting the timing?","Hap Stein","All three, it\u2019s actually regulatory approval.","Chris Lucas ","Okay. And then just one quick question, on the timing or potential timing for the remaining 1.25 million shares under the Ford sales agreement, any sense in which we should be thinking about modeling those in?","Lisa Palmer","Remember, we have until the middle of next year essentially to draw it down and we do have some visibility into potential acquisition in the first quarter of next year. I think anything prior to that at this point would be too conservative.","Chris Lucas ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.","Hap Stein","Thank you very much for your interest and time on the call. And enjoy the rest of the week and all the best. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Mas. Thank you. You may now begin.","Michael Mas","Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Martin E. Stein","Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our results for the quarter, I want to briefly address our proposal to acquire AmREIT and reaffirm our interest in pursuing a combination of our companies. As you know, on July 10, we publicly announced Regency's proposal to acquire AmREIT for $22 per share in cash or stock. At the time of the announcement, our proposal represented a 20% premium based upon the average closing price of AmREIT's common stock over the 30-day prior period and was 10% above AmREIT's all-time high. The combination would offer significant benefits to shareholders of both companies, including an opportunity to leverage synergies to grow same property NOI, a robust balance sheet with readily available capital for growth and a strong platform to realize additional value through development and densification.","We were pleased when last week on July 29, AmREIT confirmed it will commence the process to explore strategic alternatives. We expect that this process will be fair, open and robust. We look forward to participating and receiving adequate information to make this compelling combination a reality.","That being said, I would like to stress that we will be highly disciplined and, as always, shareholders' capital will only be deployed if we are confident that the opportunity meets our stringent investment criteria and creates value for Regency shareholders.","This process will not divert our team's focus on growing that operating income, delivering high-quality developments and redevelopments and maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet. With that, let's turn to the purpose of this call and discuss our extremely gratifying quarter and Regency's strategy for continuing the success.","As you'll hear from both Brian and Lisa, Regency's team is truly firing on all cylinders, executing our strategy and making progress toward our goals. First, the occupancy, pricing and merchandising power of Regency's high-quality portfolio continues to gain momentum. As evidenced by strong NOI growth, double-digit rent growth and a portfolio that is more than 95% leased, the underlying operating fundamentals are very strong and still improving across our attractive target markets. And the team has been successful not only in driving rents, but also with contractual increases.","Looking forward, we expect to continue to benefit from the historically low level of new supply, robust tenant demand for premium spaces and, particularly, the inherent quality of the portfolio, including the potential for redevelopments enabling us to achieve annual NOI growth of 3% over the long term, even as we remain above 95% leased.","Second, the outstanding characteristics of the developments we started since the downturn clearly demonstrate Regency's best-in-class development expertise and disciplined focus. We are delivering these projects at meaningful margins to the cost of acquiring centers of comparable quality. The reputation we crafted as the leading developer and the relationships we've long held with players in our target markets position us to continue to win an outsize share of the limited number of development opportunities that will meet our stringent criteria.","Third, this quarter's capital markets activity is aligned with our goal of maintaining and opportunistically strengthening an already strong balance sheet that measures up to other blue chip REITs. Lisa will describe our recent activity in greater detail, but it's clear that our balance sheet provides us with the capital sources and flexibility to astutely and cost effectively take advantage of attractive opportunities.","Looking forward, we will continue to keep our eye on executing the fundamentals while evaluating compelling opportunities to generate shareholder value and to remain at the forefront of our industry. We are constantly exploring ways to enhance our leading edge and our teams are very focused and very engaged. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap, and good afternoon, everyone. Financial results for the second quarter exceeded our expectations with core FFO per share of $0.71, representing a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year. And further on a year-to-date basis, core FFO per share has increased by nearly 7% over last year. Same property percent lease reached 95.3% and same property NOI growth excluding termination fees was 3.8% for the quarter and most importantly, the primary driver of the same property NOI growth was an increase in base rent.","In April, we issued a $250 million Green Bond, making Regency the first U.S. REIT to issue this type of security. We are extremely proud of this accomplishment, as we believe it reflects the quality of our industry-leading sustainability program. And at closing, just a reminder, we settled our previously executed forward-starting swaps. And with these swaps, we will recognize interest expense at an effective rate of 3.6% for the life of the bonds.","During the quarter, we also modified our term loan providing us with an additional $90 million of capacity and bringing the total commitment to $165 million. We have the ability to draw these additional proceeds through August of 2015 coinciding with our next unsecured bond maturity.","The spread over LIBOR was reduced by 30 basis points and the term was extended to June of 2019. As Hap said, these and prior transactions have shown that our balance sheet provides us with multiple sources of capital, allowing us substantial flexibility to fund future opportunities.","Through the second quarter, we've outperformed on many components of the plan and as a result, we increased full year guidance for core FFO per share to a new range of $2.75 to $2.80. There are multiple drivers of this increase and I'll quickly run through a few of them.","First and foremost, because of our consistently positive operating results, strong leasing and low levels of moveouts, we're benefiting from higher NOI in the same property pool, as well as in our in-process developments. This impact is evidenced by our increase in guidance ranges for both same property NOI growth and percent leased. We now expect same property NOI growth in the range of 3% to 3.7% and we expect the same property pool to finish the year in the range of 95% to 96% leased.","Second, third-party fees and commissions are also outpacing expectations, a result of the continued strength of the leasing environment. And finally, the timing of dispositions is tracking behind our original plan so we are seeing a small benefit from that standpoint, as well.","Specifically on dispositions, we raised guidance and reduced the projected cap rate. These changes reflect the combination of increased visibility for development starts, as well as our most recent acquisition, which Brian will describe in more detail. This is consistent with our matched funding capital strategy, whereby we match development spend with dispositions of noncore assets and we match acquisitions with dispositions at roughly comparable cap rates of lower growth assets. Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, we saw the hard work, the experience and the creativity of our teams continue to translate into strong operating results. We think volume remains very healthy as we take advantage of the high demand for prime space. This coupled with historically low levels of moveouts, drove same property percent leased above 95%. Small shops led the way gaining 60 basis points over the prior quarter to 90.3% leased. Given retailers' appetite for expansion in the high-quality shopping centers like ours, we still have room to run to push percent lease even further.","The caliber of our properties, the demand for quality space, the lack of new supply, and our high level of occupancy, these are powerful forces for driving rents, and our local teams are taking full advantage of this environment. Rent growth in the second quarter was 15%, representing the 13th consecutive quarter of positive rent growth. And midterm rent steps from leases signed in the quarter, exceed the portfolio average, both in terms of annual growth and a percent of leases from which we get these increases.","We recently started ground-up development on a Publix-anchored center in the Charlotte market. Willow Oaks Crossing will be Regency's first ground-up development in Charlotte and we're excited to expand our footprint in the Carolinas as Publix enters this market. We also started redevelopment work in Westchester Commons, which is an affluent suburb of Chicago where Mariano's is taking the former Dominick's space plus an additional 30,000 square feet of adjacent space and there's no downtime involved. Additionally, we'll be redeveloping our Brighten Park center in Atlanta. As part of the process, we'll replace Loehmann's with a fresh market, which is a great outcome and will inject new vitality and generate increased daily traffic for the center.","We completed our Juanita Tate development near downtown Los Angeles. By every measure, this project has outperformed, not only do we complete it at a high return of nearly 10%, but it reached 100% leased in only 14 months from groundbreaking. This project exemplifies our market base development expertise and our disciplined approach.","Since 2009, we started 19 projects, representing an investment of nearly $500 million. 12 of these projects have been completed and average 98% leased with a combined incremental return that is greater than 9%. The demographics, excellent locations and merchandising make these centers outstanding additions to our portfolio. Although new development competition is heating up, particularly in areas where we compete with high-rise, multifamily developers, I continue to believe that Regency's experience, our well-connected local development teams, with our strong retailer relationships, the credibility we have in the markets and the inherently redevelopment potential within the operating portfolio will yield an ample amount of compelling future value-add opportunities. The combination of these factors, along with the progress we've made on projects in the pipeline, enabled us to increase the low end of guidance for 2014 development and redevelopment starts.","Turning to acquisitions. We continue to see very limited amounts of A quality assets coming to market. And when they do, pricing is hypercompetitive with some centers trading well below 5% cap rates. We successfully acquired properties off market, as we did most recently with our Clybourn Commons acquisition. Clybourn Commons is located in Lincoln Park, which in our view is one of Chicago's most attractive submarkets. It boasts a 3-mile daytime population of nearly 1 million people and a combined purchasing power that exceeds $600,000, placing it among the top assets in our portfolio on this measure. The center is 100% leased and provides plentiful on-site surface parking that is rarely found in dense urban locations. We're really excited about the long term upside potential of this center.","As Lisa noted, Clybourn Commons and the earlier acquisition of Mira Vista are being match funded with the sale of 3 properties that will be sold in an average cap rate in the upper 5% range. The slightly lower acquisition cap rates for Clybourn and Mira Vista will be more than made up by their superior NOI growth profile and upside, compared to less than 1% growth that is projected from the centers being sold.","As far as dispositions go, while timing is slower than expected, demand is strong with multiple offers on many properties. As a result, we are confident we'll reach our full year guidance and achieve better pricing, which is reflected in the 50-basis-point reduction in our cap rate guidance for dispositions.","Our better cap rates reflect not only a strong transaction market, but also the fact that the assets we are selling are of better quality than in previous years as a result of the substantial progress made in eliminating low-quality properties from the portfolio.","Looking forward, as we move beyond 95% leased, I can assure you, there's not a trace of complacency. I'm gratified by the results, but even more excited about our prospects, and the team is intently focused on finding opportunities to add value to NOI growth, redevelopments and new developments.","Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thanks, Brian, and thanks, Lisa. In closing, we are pleased with our results this quarter, highlighted by strong NOI and developments that are translating into growth in core FFO and NAV. At Regency, we have the right strategy, the right balance sheet and especially the right team and our quality portfolio and development capabilities position us well to deliver for our shareholders. We remain committed to enhancing value by executing our proven business strategy and capitalizing on compelling opportunities. We really appreciate your time. We thank you for it, and will now turn the call over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you provide your expectations for timing of the remaining dispositions for the balance of the year, sort of the volume that's in the guidance range right now in each of Q3 and Q4? And how much did the change in timing actually contributed to the guidance increase, the FFO included?","Lisa Palmer","I'll handle the -- I'll answer the second part first and then I'll let Brian to add some color on the disposition market in general. But the earnings increase is really related -- so dispositions are a piece of that and depending on the timing and when we close, if we assume that we close all of them by September 1, it could be up to $0.03, really kind of a drag or dilutive for the remainder of 2014. But it's sort of depending again on when they actually close. It's going to be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.03 for the deceleration of 2014. And then the rest of the increase is related to, as we've noted on the call, third-party fees and commissions have come in above our expectations, and that's our Retailer Services group, as well as leasing commissions from our co-investment partnerships. And then we are also favorable on interest expense. We had projections in for our bond offering and it wasn't until we closed that we knew exactly what that spread would be, and that came in tighter than we had expected and then the rest is really just driven by the increases in same property NOI and development NOI, as well.","Brian M. Smith","Christy, in terms of the timing, the reason for the delay is so far is just that in the pool properties we're planning on selling this year, 7 of those properties are joint ventures, so it's taken longer than we expected to go to them and in the case where they have right of first offers actually come back to us whether they want to take advantage of those and also whether they wanted to buy out our shares. So we've since gotten past that, we've closed one of the properties since the end of the quarter and we've got a total of almost $100 million that are either under contract with our deposits or in negotiated contracts. So we feel really good about getting to the $170 million, $175 million by year end.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, Lisa, just following up on that increase in same store NOI guidance. I'm assuming that it would have been an even greater increase if you haven't had the weather related impacts in Q1. I know you tend to start out with more conservative expectations, but can you just provide a little bit more color around sort of specifically what's occurred that's been better then you expected when you first gave guidance?","Lisa Palmer","It's actually really related mostly to lower moveouts than what we expected and then also just a more -- the spread between percent rent paying and percent leased had narrowed more quickly, really not related to expenses or reimbursements. We do have -- our reconciliations are done in the first half of the year and we did have approximately -- it rounds up to about $2 million of prior year net recovery income, but that's almost exactly what we had last year. So that's not contributing to our growth.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is it lower moveouts, lower early moveouts or lower moveouts on the lease expiration?","Brian M. Smith","It's just lower moveouts in general. We had this year or this quarter 294,000 square feet in the operating portfolio and it's pretty rare to have less than 300, yet 3 in the last 4 quarters have been averaging around about 300,000. And in particular, our small shop moveouts, first half is the best half we've ever had and that follows the best year in 2013, so we're off to an even stronger start than our best year.","Lisa Palmer","And so -- I mean, if you put it in context, it's amazing how kind of little it moves the needle, right? 50 bps of same property NOI growth on a portfolio of our size, which is only 26 million square feet pro rata, is only 130,000 square feet of space.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for me, guys. First of all, you've obviously done a great job in terms of the occupancy rate with the increase in the guide this year for the -- or this quarter for the full year. Looking at or thinking about that on a regional basis, 2 of the more important states in the portfolio in terms of the percentage of annual base rent are below that midpoint in the occupancy guide and obviously Florida is very important, as well as Colorado. And I'm just curious, as you think about the strength or weakness for the portfolio, what's your outlook for Florida and Colorado? Those are 2 states that set up occupancies. Are you optimistic that you can raise the rate to the overall average?","Brian M. Smith","Yes, especially when you talked about Colorado, Colorado is one of our stronger markets in terms of rent growth and you -- I think it's the one market that stands out where there's no correlation between pricing power, which we have there and occupancy, which is low. And the reason for that this really is just we have that one vacancy in South Lowry where Safeway went dark. But other than that, the occupancy is good and we do have pricing power in that market. In terms of other markets that have lagged in the past, we're starting to see a lot of improvement, we don't yet have pricing power there, but if you look at for example, Arizona, we had 770-basis-point increase in occupancy this quarter and over 1,100 basis points year-to-year. So we're seeing activity, we're growing occupancy and with that, will come pricing power, which hasn't come yet. And then Florida's pretty much the same story. We're up 210 basis points in North Florida, which has been the weaker part, that's a quarter-to-quarter number. A lot more activities you've seen in the past and then we're even seeing, I think, some 180 basis points increase in the Inland Empire. The only market that we didn't have rent growth was the Central Valley, California. We have very little presence there. So we're starting to see contributions from markets we haven't seen in the past.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, then the second question for me and I guess, primarily this would be for Hap in your -- Hap, in your letter to AmREIT, you talked about working -- looking forward to working with that company on the densification of a couple of their projects. And I'm just curious about the appetite on the part of Regency for more urban or infill locations where densification would be a bigger part of the value creation than maybe what you guys have been doing in the past?","Martin E. Stein","And I'll make my comments in general rather than specifically as it relates to AmREIT. Based upon where our developments are taking place and our acquisitions, including the Clybourn Commons acquisitions in Lincoln Park, there is a tremendous amount of focus or greater emphasis as far as our strategy relates to investing in more near-urban locations like Lincoln Park. And at a number of our developments, for those of you that have been to Cameron Village, we have mixed-use components. And that will continue to be -- mining that part of our existing portfolio and being involved in developments like Glen Gate, which is in Chicago, which -- where we bought the whole property and sold off a portion to an apartment developer. The Riverside development near downtown Jacksonville is also adjacent to 2 apartment buildings. So we view that as being a growing component of our investment strategy, both within the existing portfolio and where we look for new developments. Most of what we've done to date have been what I call horizontal, mixed-use horizontal densification. Obviously, and we have a couple of projects where it's more vertically oriented, but that involves a lot more costs, a lot more complication, not that we wouldn't be embracing that, but we are cognizant of issues related to what I would call vertical integration on projects.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then actually, if I could, a third question and this might be more appropriate for Brian. But with the Safeway-Albertsons transaction now having been approved by Safeway shareholders, as we think about the endgame there and what might have to happen in terms of either store closings or dispositions of assets, I'm just curious if you anticipate any kind of risk or opportunity in your portfolio from a fallout that might result from that transaction?","Brian M. Smith","It's hard to tell at this point, Jim. We -- I just found out a couple of minutes ago that they're apparently going to announce it in the next couple of days the store closures. But our view on having gone space by space through the portfolio is that there's more opportunities than there is risk. We think that, by and large, they'll continue to operate a vast majority of the properties. Several of our markets we don't have any overlaps, so we don't see much risk there but good assets. Where we do have significant overlap, an example -- the perfect example, really, is San Diego and that part of Southern California. In that area, I think, we'll probably get some help from the FTC because both of those companies have significant market share in that -- there. So they're not going to be able to just close stores. So I don't know what's going to happen there, but overall, we see more opportunity than the rest of the -- the rents in Safeway portfolio are pretty low. They're -- and what I think will happen is, if we get any of those spaces back, it's likely we'll have the same kind of outcome we had when we released Dominick's to Mariano's with 160% rent growth or the Randalls down in Houston when we released at 150% rent growth.","Lisa Palmer","And then to clarify, the comment about getting help from the FTC, what Brian is referring to is that they won't be able to basically prevent us from re-leasing that space. So if they're forced to close it, they can't keep out another grocer. And that's why we would be able to recapture the space and then capitalize on the opportunity to re-lease it.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the leasing spreads, I was wondering if you could give us a sense as to where you see them trending as we move into 2015, because they've been heading up every quarter, it seems like?","Brian M. Smith","Well, they have been heading up every quarter, I think, that there's no reason why that can't continue to happen. It's obviously being driven by fundamentals, which remain strong. The lack of supply is obviously some wind in our back. Our pipeline of leasing right now is higher as a percentage of vacant space than it has been in any time in the last 5 quarters. Our occupancies continue to grow. We're well over 95% now. And we know that in our portfolio, those centers that are leased greater than 95% enjoyed 600-basis-point higher rent growth than those that were less than 95%. So I see no reason why this can't continue to happen. We just learned in July of a very significant rent growth we're getting from anchor that renewed that we actually hadn't counted on. So I don't see anything right now that's going to slow it down. We are just going to continue to mine the portfolio for opportunities and use of aggressive asset management, get back spaces where we think we can create some more value through rent growth.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you think you could be in the high-teens in 2015?","Martin E. Stein","The trend over -- that we're basically about is continuing -- hopefully continuing to double-digit rent growth that we've experienced the last couple of quarters.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Brian, you talked about new developments heating up where end markets where you're seeing high-rise being built for multifamily. Was that a comment about the competition for land versus those developers or just about retail supply coming on?","Brian M. Smith","Well, we're seeing increased competition everywhere. In terms of the north players that we're running into competing for size, it has definitely grown. But that is particularly true in the urban areas and when you look at the pricing in urban areas where the really hot markets could be in the peninsula in the San Francisco area, if you're competing against people who can take that land and go vertical with office or multifamily, then we don't stand a very good chance, unless we control the site first, which is exactly what happened in our situation, Hap mentioned Glen Gate in Chicago. So overall, there's more competition, it's very heated and it's tough to compete with when it's urban and there's other uses. But I'd also say that it's happening in the suburbs, particularly in markets like Houston, where you're seeing things that frankly we haven't seen since 2006, 2007, where people are -- they're putting up hard deposits day 1. They're closing in 60 days where they got entitlements or anchored tenants or not and in the case of suburbs, actually doing land banking. It has to have an impact yet on supply because this isn't -- it's still not even close to the amount of development we saw in the heyday. But it is -- there is more competition.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the potential longer-term plans for the newly acquired Lincoln Park assets and if you have any sense of scope, dollar size or square footage of any redevelopment work that you could potentially do there?","Brian M. Smith","We don't have any plans for anything right now. It's one of the sites that has endless possibilities, but we like the way it is. It's got it all, whether -- density, the affluence, the education, the great streets, the walkability to the neighborhoods there. It clearly could go vertical. What it has is a tremendous competitive advantage and it has a lot of ample surface parking that you traditionally find in the suburbs and not in these urban areas. This is going to be one of those things where should any kind of bad news happen, it's going to translate into good news and the opportunities for us, but until this thing happen, we're just content with the asset where it is.","Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is there any sort near- or medium-term lease maturities that could spark a redevelopment at that asset that you could take advantage of?","Brian M. Smith","Not enough to do a whole redevelopment.","Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the small shop space, you noted an improvement there, I guess, sequentially and year-over-year. What should we be thinking about over the next, I guess, 12 or 18 months? And where is that demand coming from? Is it a pickup in the mom-and-pops type tenants that are getting better access to financing? Or is it the regional and national tenants still driving that?","Brian M. Smith","It's still predominantly the national and regional tenant's, franchises. A lot of expansion that we're starting to see from restaurants and retailers that maybe had 1 or 2 or just a handful of locations who were more cautious in years past are now willing to expand in the new markets, oftentimes new states and increase their store count. A lot of the new concepts coming up particularly in the restaurant category. And we're starting to hear about funding from that hasn't been available in the past, but again, that's never been a big focus for us since the downturn.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jay Carlington with Greenstreet Advisors.","Jay Carlington","Great. Hap, just to circle back on AmREIT. Have you had any direct conversations with their board? And can you give us some insight in how positive or receptive they've been? And then maybe as a follow-up, can you give us an update on your current ownership in their stock and how do think that could change?","Martin E. Stein","I think that we've been pretty clear, Jay, as far as what public information is out there, and I guess, because I indicated. We're pleased that they're proceeding -- or based upon what they've said on the call and what they said in the press release that there proceeding with a process, that based upon those words, it's going to be open, robust and fair, and we're very happy about that. And our ownership that we announced at the time was 4.2% and obviously to the extent we would exceed 5% in ownership, we'd have to make a public announcement about that.","Jay Carlington","And then, Brian, maybe just switching over to, I guess, the match funding that you've talked about lining your acquisitions with dispositions of similar cap rates and lower growth profiles. Can you kind of give us a sense of how big a pool of assets that could be? And is there a common denominator between them, whether it's property type or location?","Brian M. Smith","Well, the pool, frankly, because we sold 5 of our higher-risk assets this year-to-date. It's really the pool would be any of the disposition candidates are out there, which would be -- could be high -- for the match funding would be high quality, but low growth assets, for example, we sold 5 Points this quarter. We sold the title [ph] to CVS. Those are both really good assets, but they were low growth. So the pool, I think, would -- say, the opportunity is there.","Lisa Palmer","I think we identified about $250 million worth. So I mean, it's not a huge pool and what I think what you're going to begin to see, Jay, is the kind of the 2 pools that we talked about. So we -- the one that funds the development and what's going to fund our acquisitions that they're going to start to merge as we sell our lower kind of noncore -- our lower quality noncore assets, we have very, very, very little of that left. And so now the focus is really just going to be on those lower growth assets and many of them have lower cap rates.","Martin E. Stein","And I think, the discipline that this match funding strategy, as it relates to acquisitions, what we're basically saying to our team is that if you want buy an asset, you've got to come up with an asset that we can sell at a roughly comparable cap rate and with as visibility if the NOI growth rate is significantly lower in what we want to sell and what we're looking to buy.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust, Robinson, Humphrey.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just first quick question on your FFO guidance. I don't like to focus on too much just given that there's many moving parts to it, but I just trying to reconcile, particularly $1.42 per share you've earned this first half and then just kind of used simple dumb math and doubled it, it still is above your guidance of $2.775 [ph]. What are the pieces that can take that $2.84 or projected number down to a $2.77?","Lisa Palmer","Again, it's part of what I answered in the earlier call is the reimbursement income, it's heavy in the first half of the year. So that's about $0.02 that does not recur in the first half of the year. It recurs annually in the first half. It's just part of the seasonal variations in our income. And then the fact that the question that Christy asked at the very beginning, how much is the timing of the dispositions, our disposition guidance has actually been increased, yet we've sold very little here today. So with that being back-end loaded, that's going to have a drag of $0.01 to $0.03. And then G&A could potentially, the run rate for G&A could potentially be $500,000 to $1 million higher per quarter for filling open positions.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Sorry about that. I guess, I missed that part. And then just second question on AmREIT, if I go back to your opening remarks and you said you expect to receive adequate info, would it be correct to categorized the current situation as you haven't gotten much live dialogue with the company, just based on your kind of commentary? And tied to that is, obviously the upside of AmREIT, lot of it stems from their redevelopment or development potential. When you guys walk around AmREIT's assets, especially like uptown park, do you see a different vision from those types of assets and at least what they lay out in their public information?","Martin E. Stein","I'm not going to respond to the second part of it -- that question. The first part, I just -- basically, what we said is that they made an announcement both on the press release and their earnings call and we take those words to be sincere that they're going to run a robust process. And we based our comments both in our press release and in my prepared remarks that, that's the case. And how we continue to evaluate the portfolio and we'll continue to do that at the process and we get the additional information that we expect to get to the -- up to the process unfolds.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you've identified a portfolio in the marketplace and AmREIT, which meets a number of the criteria you're looking for, that's income, density, future development opportunities. I guess I'm curious if in your preliminary thoughts on potential funding of an acquisition of AmREIT, how that perhaps might have changed, how you look at your own assets today. Have you identified incrementally more assets in your portfolio that you would potentially look to sell that you may otherwise have sold further down the road beyond the $250 million that you've talked about on today's call?","Martin E. Stein","We said that we'll look at -- I think we have a lot of flexibility, both on our line of credit, both on the debt that would be available to us, so we wouldn't be suffering from maturity risks, both from selling assets in the portfolio and other balance sheet steps that we could take. If we consummate any transaction, we will consider all the alternatives that are out there to cost effectively and astutely finance that transaction.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like you do a portfolio review, if in the case you were successfully able to consummate transactions down the road at some point. Another question on ground-up development, the Charlotte deal here. We've heard consistently from -- I mean, it appears that rents aren't quite necessarily where they need to be for a new development to pick up in a meaningful way. So curious what about the market or submarket location that appeal to you. And curious perhaps what other markets of opportunities you are looking at today in terms of development?","Brian M. Smith","Well, we've heard that for quite some time that the rents are just fine, but I guess all I can point to, again, with this $500 million of starts that we've done since the downturn and the fact that we had development in terms about 9% and the ones that have been completed average 98% leased. So we've proven that there's demand, and proven that the demand is at good returns. In terms of this particular property, we just like the fact that we like Charlotte. We like the Carolinas in general. It's performed very well for us. The -- it's under retailed there. If you can measure the GLA per capita in terms of the national average and we are very fond of Publix. It's one of the great restaurants in the country and this should be a Publix-anchored center in a very high growth area of Charlotte. It's at the corner of main on main of the new extension of George Liles Parkway and it's rightsized and has a possibility to expand it and it's also an excellent return in the mid 80s. So there's a lot of things that we do like about it.","Martin E. Stein","Just to further amplify on Brian's comments is that, as he indicated and as I indicated, the opportunity set of developments that check the boxes from a quality, from a criteria standpoint and from return standpoint is very limited. We just think we are well positioned to get more than our fair share of those developments that we check the boxes, including returns.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Maybe [indiscernible] quickly, Lisa, with your recent Green Bond issuance, I guess I can understand the social value, but can you perhaps quantify any discount in pricing or any other benefits that may not be, well, as apparent to that type of observer?","Lisa Palmer","It so difficult to really quantify if there is any benefit at all. It certainly didn't hurt us, but I don't believe that there's any pricing advantage as a result of it. We did have a number of SRI investors in the book, but I don't think that it narrowed the spread at all.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Lisa, I don't usually see a half full term loan. So I'm guessing you guys are going to -- because I realized it's new, the increase capacity. But I'm guessing you guys are going to fill that term loan as a first source of capital and a run to 19, is that probably accurate?","Lisa Palmer","I think the key thing and it was in my prepared remarks, so it's just that we have the ability as a delayed draw up until August of next year, which coincides with our bond maturity in 2015. We have a pretty -- we have a large maturity next year of $350 million. And thinking about staggering our debt maturities, we would likely do 2 different tenors to refinance that. So this is a means of doing that.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay, I got you. And then as you look at the mortgages that you have coming due, would you ever encumber anything else at this point, I mean, or re-encumber any of these assets? Or as these mortgages mature, do you plan to take them off and always replace with some sort of unsecured instrument?","Lisa Palmer","That certainly would be in the plan except in our coinvestment partnerships. We would continue to refinance with mortgages.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee with Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Hap, as the news of the AmREIT proposal, the amount, I think the collective reaction was, \"Wow, that's pretty un-Regency like.\" And I guess, are we witnessing a change in strategy or DNA? Or was there something about this deal, specific, that set it apart?","Martin E. Stein","I guess we indicated in our letter that we made public that we tried to negotiate with them. We ask for information and then when they decided not to provide us with that information and sit and negotiate with us, we decided in May that it was too compelling of an opportunity for their shareholders and for Regency's shareholders and that prompted us to go public. And I just -- I'll leave it at that.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just following up on Jim's question earlier. You guys have always been very prolific developers and looks like that's playing out again this cycle. A question is how do you account with growing that development risk further as percentage of your offering portfolio, particularly if you close on deal like AmREIT, given how much of that -- how much value in that story depends on development upside?","Martin E. Stein","I think that, as we've said, we're going to be...","Lisa Palmer","Let me first -- I'm going to say he's answering this, strategically, as a Regency generic, nothing to do with the AmREIT.","Martin E. Stein","At least we said that we're going to look at that investment on a very disciplined basis and what makes compelling sense for our shareholders. And I think we've said, and I think we demonstrated since the downturn and we're committed to a very disciplined development program of developing those assets that meet our criteria and also limiting that as a percentage, how much balance sheet exposure that we're going to -- in terms of -- as a multiple of EBITDA. And I don't see anything that's going to change that because I got the strategy and the guideline that makes compelling sense and it's going to make sure that we're making the right investments for the right reasons.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One.","Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Hap, actually, could you just remind us what that percentage or multiple approach is right now for the company, as it relates to the development risk exposure?","Martin E. Stein","It's 2x EBITDA, which translates into approximately, today, about $850 million and that is the amount that we have under construction plus future commitments and we're a little bit less than half of that right now.","Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. Brian, just I guess I'm trying to understand on the tenant moveout issue, maybe if you could put it in a context of tenant retention rates, how -- what you're seeing, say the last couple of quarters compares to the 2005, 2006 sort of top of market environment?","Brian M. Smith","Well, in terms of moveouts, whether you look at it -- it's a mix, less than $300,000. It's just really unusual. You can go back to 2006 or any of those years and still $300,000 was very low and yet ours has been averaging that for 3 of the last 4 quarters. Maybe it's the small shop. It's the best first half we've had following the best second half. So that's takes into consideration all those quarters back then, and it's just -- and you got to remember, too, that we're doing a lot of strategic moveouts where we're trying to get space back, we want to move the tenants out. We've had multiple examples recently of names you'd recognized whether it's Outback Steakhouse or Dunkin' Donuts or others who want to renew, and we're saying, \"no,\" and you'd think that would elevate the moveouts. So it's a very healthy portfolio right now. We just put a survey of all our tenancy and we have 1,250 responses and less than 4% came back and said that they were likely not to renew. So there's not only strong external demand, but the returns of those portfolio wouldn't stay.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Martin E. Stein","We thank everyone for their time. It does appear that there is a question, which I'd be happy to answer or pass along to Brian or Lisa.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick question, just on the development side of things. Again, I appreciate all the commentary about increasing competition and that kind of thing. I'm just curious, though, are you seeing an increase in breadth of demand from sort of traditional anchored tenants to take space? Or are these competition, are they moving forward without sort of that anchor backing?","Brian M. Smith","Yes, we're seeing -- as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing a lot of people, a lot of developers taking down land where they don't have the anchor in place at all. Whether that's a land bank or they're just going to -- they just want to be able to compete, get the property and they have confidence they'll be able to do something. We particularly see that, again, would be in the urban areas, in markets like the Bay Area, in Houston where things are so hot that if they can't make it work as retail, there's alternative uses in offices or residential.","Martin E. Stein","And a lot of the competition is non-retail.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Got you. And then just a question, a clarifying point on the $250 million secured. So obviously you have the flexibility to draw down the term loan, all the way out to debt maturity, but just curious, given where rates are today and your expectations about rates over the next -- until that maturity comes due, I'm just curious if it would make any sense to pull that forward?","Lisa Palmer","I will remind you that we actually hedged $250 million already of our 2015 by [indiscernible] at a treasury plus swap rate of 2.67%. So that is our interest rate other than the term loan is obviously is floating over LIBOR.","Operator","And it appears there are no other questions in the queue at this time. Would you like to proceed with any closing comments?","Martin E. Stein","Yes. We appreciate everybody's participation in the call. Thank you and everybody have a great day and into the weekend, have a great weekend. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation and we wish you a very wonderful day."],"18127":["Regency Centers Corporation (NASDAQ:REG) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call May  7, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Mike Mas - SVP, Capital Markets","Hap Stein - Chairman & CEO","Lisa Palmer - CFO","Brian Smith - President & COO","Analysts","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Christine McElroy - Citi","Jay Carlington - Green Street Advisors","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Mike Mueller - JPMorgan","Operator","Welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, Mr. Mas. You may begin.","Mike Mas","Good morning and welcome to Regency's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we start, I would like to point out two additional disclosure items in our supplement. First, the added disclosure of the impact of redevelopment on same property NOI growth, on pages 7 and 11.","And second, an added reconciliation of net income to AFFO on page 10. Because AFFO definitions can differ, our intent is to highlight for our shareholders certain non-cash income and expense items, as well as capital expenditures.","I would also like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","We also request that callers observe a two question limit during the question and answer portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoining the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We had another really good quarter and the results speak for themselves. So I'll be brief before passing you along to Lisa and to Brian. The combination of successful execution of the four main components of our strategy will continue to distinguish Regency.","First, our high quality portfolio is well positioned to sustain superior NOI growth. This is supported by another strong quarter of operating results, including NOI growth that exceeded 4% and follows three full years at this level. Second, we're making progress on a visible pipeline that supports our ability to deliver $100 million to $200 million of development and redevelopment starts and deliveries in 2015 and in future years. In a few minutes, Brian will share with you more details on our efforts to create great shopping centers and compelling value. Third, our balance sheet remain strong.","And as Lisa will discuss, we're astutely enhancing it through organic earnings growth, cost-effective match funding and opportunistic capital markets activity. And most importantly our talented team remains highly engaged, with developing and employing best-in-class operating systems and continues to successfully execute this strategy.","That said, we understand this is a marathon and gold medals are not handed out for short-term results. I have no doubt that Regency's exceptional team will continue to differentiate our company with high levels of performance in each of the key aspects of our strategy, delivered consistently over extended periods of time. Lisa will now walk you through our results.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap and good morning, everyone. Our first-quarter results were very strong. Core FFO per share was $0.74, representing an increase of more than 7% over the first quarter of 2015. Same property NOI growth excluding termination fees was 4.4% which includes a net positive impact from redevelopment of 120 basis points.","Although we benefited from move-out levels that were lower than we typically experience in the first quarter of the year and also better than expected percentage rent, base rent growth of 4.2%, driven by last year's robust leasing and double-digit rent spreads continues to be the largest contributing factor to same property NOI growth.","The low move-out volumes in the first quarter, along with the additional percentage rent, will have a positive impact on full-year results, allowing us to raise the low end of our guidance ranges for same property NOI growth by 20 basis points and Core FFO per share by $0.02. With respect to G&A, our first quarter is moderately higher than the projected remaining quarterly run rate.","Development and leasing capitalization are expected to increase modestly through the year as leasing activity and development starts increase, providing a quarterly net G&A run rate closer to $15 million over the remaining three quarters. We continue to expect that we'll finish the year within the original range provided of $60 million to $63.5 million.","As Hap said, maintaining and further enhancing Regency's conservative balance sheet is a critical component of our strategy. We'll rely heavily on organic earnings growth as we generate results like we have over the past several quarters. We'll also continued to match fund our new investments, with the primary source of capital for development and acquisitions being the sale of lower growth properties.","And importantly, when matching an acquisition, the disposition will have a comparable cap rate as the acquisition, but a lower growth profile. Also, when the use and pricing make compelling sense, we will opportunistically use equity as a funding source, like we did with the forward offering completed in January.","As a reminder, the forward structure allows us to drawdown proceeds and issue the shares through the end of the year at the per share closing price on the offering date of $67.40. We expect one of the identified uses for the equity offering which is the acquisition of University Commons in Boca Raton, Florida, to close in the third quarter.","We will drawdown the necessary proceeds at that time, effectively matching our capital needs with the funding source from both a cost and timing perspective. We will also settle a piece of the forward offering to address a portion of our unsecured bond maturity in August and to fund develop and spend throughout 2015. Brian?","Brian Smith","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Our portfolio is performing better than ever which is apparent in our consistently strong results. We continue to focus on leasing to high-performing gross re-anchors, best-in-class operators and unique restaurants and retailers that differentiate and activate our shopping centers. And in doing so expand our trade areas and increased shopper traffic.","Our centers are located on great quarters in affluent suburbs and infiltrate areas with substantial purchasing power and barriers to entry. This combination provide sustainable, competitive advantages that allow us to capitalize on landlord-favored market and leverage the high quality real estate in our portfolio.","This portfolio strength is demonstrated by our same property NOI growth that once again exceeded 4%. The health of our tenant base is evident in percentage rent that surpassed expectations, due to higher than forecasted sales volumes. It's also apparent in our rent growth which has approached or exceeded double digits for some time now.","This quarter, rent growth on new leases was nearly 30%, coming entirely from shop space. Another indication of our portfolio strength and tenant health is a low level of move-outs which were well below our expectations for the first quarter and have trended at low levels for the past four quarters. In fact, as a percentage of occupied space, this was the lowest quarter of move-outs that we have on record which is particularly noteworthy, given the typical seasonality of higher move-outs in the first quarter of the year.","As Lisa said, this will have a positive impact on earnings which allows us to improve our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm also pleased with the strides that our industry step developing team is making on our pipeline which gives me confidence in our ability to meet our development and redevelopment goals.","Although ground upstarts this year will be back-end loaded, for each of the projects we expect to start, we either control or own the land and assign leases where we have firm commitments from the anchors. As we've said on prior calls, the success of Regency's development program is occurring despite the dramatically lower level of new shopping center development starts and our own stringent criteria and disciplined focus.","Persimmon Place is a prime example of exceptional quality, performance and compelling spreads of our in-process developments and redevelopments which totaled $300 million. The Whole Foods anchored center that is yet to open is already 96% leased and committed. Unique to this Whole Foods offering will be a wine tasting and tap room, a noodle bar and a build-your-own-pizza venue. Adjacent to Whole Foods, Persimmon will feature a large outdoor plaza area that will accommodate live performances and connect the center to the community.","These place-making enhancements, along with our lineup of fresh-look tenants capture the theme of our center which plays to the Bay Area food and wine culture. Specifically Sur La Table will bring a unique culinary offering, along with two new and exciting restaurant concepts, Urban Plates and Pacific Catch.","The projected return of 7.5% represents a spread of approximately 300 basis points above the cap rate at which we could purchase this irreplaceable shopping center. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with this quarter's results and excited about the team's focus and how well Regency is positioned for the future.","Thank you for listening. We will now turn the call over to the operator for question and answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. ","Jeff Donnelly","Thank you for the additional disclosure around the redevelopment contribution to NOI. Can you tell us what embedded in your 2015 NOI guidance from the redevelopment contribution?","Hap Stein","I can give you an exact number I can give you a range. When you think about what we expect to do on an ongoing basis, a target of somewhere between $30 million and $50 million of redevelopments annually that should add with our disclosed returns of 7% to 10% -- that should add somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 basis points annually to our growth rate and in 2015 we're on the higher end of that.","Jeff Donnelly","Maybe just a follow-up, it might be kind of that two parter. The last call I think you guys were talking about having like a 92% objective for occupancy on your small shop leasing it pullback in the quarter what I suspect is a seasonal step back. Are you guys still confident in that objective? I noticed the same thing with kind of your leasing spreads were a little lower, is it just sort of a one-time blip that's more seasonal? Just curious what your take was?","Hap Stein"," Yes, Jeff, it is seasonal we lost ten basis points in total occupancy and usually for the first quarter we lose about 24 so less than half of what we usually lose in the first quarter. In the small shops we lost 30 basis points and that's also about half of what we normally lose in the first quarter. So we're not worried about the leasing it's actually very strong, we\u2019ve got of lots of demand, our pipeline is right where it's been in other quarters last four quarter rolling average, so it all looks good.","Brian Smith","And I would add, Jeff, if you look back to [indiscernible] first quarter 2015 over first quarter 2014 we actually did more leasing transactions in the first quarter of this year than we did last year it was primarily in the small shop space, so the actual square footage was just a little bit lower like 70,000 square feet lower and then also our new lease rent growth for the quarter for spaces they get less than 12 months to close to 30% so that did not decelerate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Schmidt","Where do you guys expect cap rates for openers centers to trend? Do you think they'll further compress in 2015? Or, what do you see going forward?","Hap Stein","Craig we haven't been very good about predicting that, I wish I had position to do it. But ","what's happening right now is after been steady what I would say for the last while, last several quarters, at 5% I think with the continued influx of private capital and particularly foreign capital we're seeing those cap rates go down. I would say the average now is easily 44.75% to 5% depending on growth and IRR is now dipping below 6.5%. There is a couple of transactions that are out there right now I think both give good examples they're both very expensive one is over $100 million and other one and is in the $90 million range and those look like they are going to be going in the mid-4%'s and IRR is going to be down below low 6s it just very competitive out there.","Brian Smith","From our perspective, once again, as Lisa alluded to, our strategy, anything we're going to be buying is going to be match funded so if we happen to be buying a lower cap rate deal, we\u2019re going be selling a lower cap rate center but the center that we're selling is going to have a much lower growth profile and upside prospects than what we're going to be buying.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And this is more of an industrywide question than just to focus on Regency. What you see as the biggest impediments to seeing an increasing ground-up development in the strip category?","Hap Stein","Well, there are several things that are making it really tough. I mean first of all, for the next -- for the short-term the grocery pipelines are pretty full. I mean there is obviously a of over hang out there, if you look at Chicago you've still got 29 vacant Dominic's I think on the West Coast you still have concerns on the part of grocers -- not concerns but there may be opportunities to pick up some Haggens. So I think unless you have a really, really good grocer anchored opportunity for the grocers they are not going to go for it which I think is healthy for the industry and I think when you look at the projects that we're doing makes you feel better about them.","I think just the areas that we're looking where the retailers are looking, they are still focused on the in-fill, the denser closed-end locations and those are just very, very difficult to do. I have a lot of capital to do it, nobody seems to be venturing out into emerging areas. And land prices, land prices continue in those areas to get higher. I think for example at La Floresta, if that were to come on to the market today I think the land price would be more than double what we paid for and the returns would probably be closer to 6% than where we're at mid-7s.","Brian Smith","And that\u2019s our whole food center in Northern Orange County.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Christine McElroy","I just wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question on small shop occupancy, I think last year just a clarification last year, you thought about a 200 basis point move higher from trough in Q1 to peak in Q4 in that lease rate. So I'm wondering given that you had the lower move-out to Q1, sort of what your expectations are for that small shop lease trajectory for 2015 and you didn't change your overall occupancy forecast for yearend, but does that Q1 activity sort of give you more confidence in the higher end of the range at this point?","Hap Stein","I think at least in terms of where we think small shop occupancy can go I don't think we've changed our opinion on that at all. I think we can get to 92% I think we can get above that. As I mentioned, Christy, the demand is definitely still there, the biggest thing that's been holding us back, frankly besides first quarter, is just a lack of move-out. I mean it helps our occupancy but it doesn't help us with new leasing. So I think we can continue to get there with the demand that we're experiencing, it's just a question of how high it goes.","Brian Smith","And when you get there.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And regarding Juanita Tate Marketplace I'm wondering can you discuss the nature of that cell and the pre-negotiated yield? And will that $7 million gain on sale in Q2 flow-through FFO in the second quarter since it was recently completed or will that be considered an operating property?","Hap Stein","I will handle the first part and then let Lisa, handle the second part of that quick question, Christy but some history is really relevant here on Juanita Tate. That deal literally started 21 years ago when I was at a prior company. There is a local nonprofit community organization called Concerned Citizens for South Central Los Angeles and they very much needed and wanted to have a grocery anchored neighborhood center in their community. There was nothing around, there was no fresh food offerings, they had no idea how to do it they had this land under contract and so I worked with them for a couple of years to show them the development process, try to help them get through it.","When I moved over to Regency, the predecessor company two or three years later and it was just clear they weren't going to be able to get through this. So we took the project on our sales, but, the area back then, 20 years ago was nowhere near the area it is today. It has evolved into a much better area.","And frankly the concern back then was once we developed it, we knew it would be successful, the demand was huge and the supply of competing centers didn't exist, but we were frankly concerned about the safety of our property managers going to the property. So, the only way at that time we were interested in doing this is if we had a commitment to sell it up front. ","Concerned citizens of South Central Los Angeles always wanted to be part of the project and they always wanted to maintain ownership of the end of the day so we negotiated this and at that time the development returns were in the neighborhood of 12.5% and we negotiated about a 25% profit margin, I think it was 10 cap presale that we negotiated.","It obviously took far longer than you can imagine, anybody could imagine, just the difficulty of developing in real urban areas and so what we did is we continue to adjust the spread to maintain pretty much the profit margin but we would love today to own this. I mean if we were starting all over this would be a property we would want to own, we frankly were hoping that the deal would fallout but we gave our word, we had a commitment to this nonprofit and we're honoring it.","Brian Smith","And it certainly doesn't represent a change in strategy to margin development.","Hap Stein","And with regards to whether it's in or out of FFO in the spirit of trying to adhere even more closely to NAREIT defined it will now be part of FFO, so we will not be including any gains on sale of properties.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jay Carlington with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Carlington","So just a follow-up on that, if it was pre-negotiated, why wasn't it disclosed?","Hap Stein","While I think you never knew for sure if it was going to happen. I mean Concerned Citizens themselves does not have any financial strength so they had a partner up with somebody for the long-term ownership in the purchase of it and one of the grants the Section 104 grant had to be approved by the redevelopment agency to transfer to the new buyer. So it was unclear whether that was going to happen and as I said we were kind of hoping it would fallout, there was just too low level of certainty.","Jay Carlington"," I know just switching gears here. So I guess granted your one disposition this quarter was extremely small but looking at that at a 9% cap and then you take into account Juanita Tate and Auburn Village call it a low 7% and mid6%'s you're looking at blended cap rate of low 7%'s or high 6%'s on those sales. So how do we think about that in the context of matched funding with university commons at a 5% cap?","Lisa Palmer","First, we didn't change our disposition guidance, so our guidance cap rate is still 6.5% to 7% number one. Number two as I said in my prepared remarks and hopefully we\u2019ve been communicating for the past, gosh I don't know how many four to eight quarters. So the match funding strategy, the disposition of those -- the lower -- when you think of the Regency's quality, Regency's lower quality, it may not be lower quality to all, but Regency's lower quality shopping centers that funding our developments. So 6.5% to 7% cap rate on those dispositions basically are funding our developments where our returns are higher than that. So that's a positive spread. University Commons we would match fund that with the sale of a more comparable cap rate property in this case we actually match fund that with equity. So that's not in our disposition guidance because we're going to draw down on our forward equity to fund that acquisition.","Jay Carlington","Okay, that makes sense. And just to double check on the guidance the redevelopment development spend is it still 25% I think on redev and the rest on development?","Lisa Palmer","I'm not certain that we've actually given that guidance. Just the spend or the start?","Jay Carlington","Just the dollar amount on the spending guidance that you\u2019ve given. I think it's mentioned on the last call roughly 25% of that would be redevelopment but maybe that's not the case?","Lisa Palmer","Yes. It might be a little north of that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Just first on the active development pipeline it was stable quarter-over-quarter. How is the shadow development pipeline trending?","Hap Stein","Well, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks it's going to be back end loaded. We expect we're going to do 100 million to 200 million of those probably $70 million is going to be redevelopment and we feel very good about those. So in order to hit the guidance we've got to do ground-up developments of between 30 million and a 130 million. We're working on nine projects that could happen in 2015. I think seven of those look real promising and a total of $140 million. So we currently have the properties and the opportunities, the real challenge is not will they happen so much the timing on these. And the reason for that is we've got some that are mixed-use where we\u2019re dependent upon the multifamily or other use. Some of them are part of the master plan community where the developer has to perform certain responsibilities and [indiscernible]. And on the final one we're actually dependent on what happens on an adjacent parcels. So everything as I said feels real good, it's just a question of the timing, we hope they all come in the fourth quarter and that's my expectation.","Unidentified Analyst","And with regards to sort of leasing in the quarter I know there is some seasonality there but can you sort of talk about the renewal ratio as a percentage of overall expirations and how that was overall? What's for anchors and small shop?","Hap Stein","The renewal rate was over 75% in total which is higher than average, the shop I think we were 66% and that's about average and the anchors were almost 90%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Sullivan","Hap, I'm curious we've been seeing more grocers take space in the past few years in both power centers. As well as open more stores in mixed-use urban locations. Given your very strong relationships with pressures how aggressive will you be considering either of these alternatives for future grocer unit growth and which is your preferred focus of the two? And when I say preferred focus, I'm not thinking in terms of power centers, it's not so much about ground up development but rather potentially value added acquisitions given the impact that putting a grocer in a power center can have on the value of the property?","Hap Stein","Jim, I think that value added acquisition opportunities is next to redevelopments because they ultimately become redevelopments would be investment priority one so that's our primary focus on those that we think are going to make sense and have upside potential we're also expanding our net to include mixed-use projects that make sense, not necessarily the urban, dense urban vertical developments but with primary focus on horizontal and somewhat on the near urban with some amount of verticality to that.","Jim Sullivan","So for example the kind of standalone grocer that we\u2019re seeing go into some of the urban locations where it's just a grocer that kind of development is less appealing?","Hap Stein","That is less appealing we like to have we're looking at an opportunity where we're on the ground floor with a grocer and then on adjacent building we have an opportunity to purchase the ground floor which will give us an opportunity to have and include shop space, retailers and restaurants and that's more our cup of tea where we think we can really add value on the side shop space next to a strong grocer and also have all the activity around and all the daytime population around the vertical development that\u2019s either adjacent to or part of the development.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Mueller","Yes, looking at the 2015 development start guidance the range the upper end of the yield expectation looks like it moved up a little bit, just wondering if you could just talk about that, was it just one project or just some view that yields could be a little bit higher going forward?","Mike Mas","The guidance from last quarter was actually 7% to 8.5% I think the e-mail that you probably received our supplement from included a 7%, 8% range and it was corrected within two minutes of that distribution, so there has been a change to our expectations on yields.","Operator","There appear to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate you taking the time on the call and your interest in Regency and wish you have a great rest of the week and a great weekend. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Laura Clark, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. ","Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Clark ","Good morning, and welcome to Regency's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, President; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.","On today's call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.","Before turning the call over to Hap, I would like to highlight updates for development and redevelopment pages within our supplemental disclosure. We have included additional information in an effort to provide enhanced guidance around timing for initial rent commencement and stabilization, as well as expectations for NOI coming offline, as we position pipeline projects for start. ","We hope you will find this useful. Hap?","Hap Stein ","Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our leasing activity and pipeline and are experiencing healthy tenant demand across multiple categories. The retail environment continues to evolve, as grocers and retailers remain focused on the importance of high-quality physical locations that provide shoppers with the best combination of convenience, of service and of experience. ","Regency will make the right decisions that will enable our shopping centers to remain relevant in driving places for outstanding retailers to connect with the surrounding neighborhoods and communities in the top markets across the country.","As you'll hear from Lisa, the team is intensely focused on addressing short-term headwinds, driven by what we believe is a rare confluence of atypical bankruptcies together with the timing of larger redevelopments. ","You should know that I share her confidence that we will soon return to core earnings and dividend growth and total returns that will be among the sector leaders to Regency's combination of strategic advantages, which include, our high-quality portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers anchored by high performing grocers located in the fluid and dense trade areas; our experienced development and redevelopment capabilities and deep pipeline; free cash flow after capitals and dividends that funds our developments and redevelopments on an extremely favorable and cost-effective basis, supported by our strong balance sheet; and Regency's exceptional team located in top markets across the country with a commitment to industry-leading, environmental, social and governance practices.","Before turning the call over to Lisa, I am happy to report that the Executive Succession Plan that we announced last quarter is progressing well. Mike has seamlessly moved into the role of CFO and as you know, Lisa is fully prepared to be Regency's CEO, when I become Executive Chairman on January 1st. ","I am extremely confident that Regency will continue to progress on our journey from good to great under Lisa and our talented team. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer ","Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. I want to reiterate how honored I am that you and Regency's Board of Directors have entrusted me to lead Regency. I am excited about the opportunity and I am looking forward to continuing to work alongside with you and with the rest of our exceptional team.","First on the call today, I will provide some comments around our 2019 guidance. 2019 same-property NOI guidance has been updated to 2%, which is taking the high-end off the table. You may recall, last quarter, we stated that we did expect to finish the year at the low-end of our previous range of 2% to 2.5%. ","And I will remind you that a few factors have contributed to this to our same-property NOI growth being below our strategic objective including the bankruptcy impacts specifically related to Sears Kmart, a muted contribution from redevelopment, and timing around leasing and move-outs in the first half of the year. ","In spite of these headwinds, it is notable that we expect 2019 core operating earnings growth to come in at the high-end of our 3% to 4% range.","Looking ahead to 2020, we will provide full year guidance with our fourth quarter earnings release. However, we want to share an initial preview of our 2020 expectations. Due to what we consider to be a unique set of circumstances, same-property NOI and core operating earnings growth in 2020 is currently expected to be flat to slightly positive. ","This temporary dip in growth is primarily being driven by a couple of factors. First, an elevated impact from bankruptcies including a 50 basis impact just from Barney's, plus additional known and potential move outs for tenants such as IPIC, Dress Barn and Pier 1. ","And second, an estimated $4 million of NOI that we are proactively taking offline next year for in-process and planned redevelopments will be offsetting the positive contribution from projects that were completing, as well as just the general timing of starts and deliveries.","Beyond 2020, we do have conviction that we will return to 3% NOI growth and 4% plus earnings growth driven by a number of key components. We believe that the elevated impact from bankruptcies largely a result of our unique Barney's will return to a more normalized range in 2021. ","While we are cognizant of the evolving retail environment and its challenges, the quality of our portfolio, our well-located properties and top notch team give me confidence, but going forward, and consistent with our experience in the past, Regency will have relatively lower exposure to store rationalization. ","In addition, we continue to see healthy tenant demand as evidenced by our active and full leasing pipelines is giving me further confidence in the potential for upside in rent paying occupancy for both anchors and shops.","We continue to achieve annual embedded rent steps, translating to a build in approximate a 130 basis points of growth across the portfolio. Growing rents in the 7% to 8% range also translates to an additional 100 basis points of growth. We are making great progress on our in-process redevelopment projects and we have good visibility to contributions that will support our 3% same-property growth objective in the future. ","In fact, over the next five years, our pipeline is positioned to generate approximately $45 million of incremental NOIs from eight specifically identified projects including the Abbot, Market Common, Westwood and Serramonte to name a few that Mac will talk about and just a bit.","And while the contributions from redevelopments will be uneven at times, as we prepare for and start these more complex projects. Over time, these value-creating redevelopments will translate into a positive contribution that should average approximately 75 basis points of growth, even with these two years of muted contribution. ","Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, our team remains keenly focused on blocking and tackling and executing our strategy to enable Regency to return to sector-leading total returns. Jim?","Jim Thompson ","Thanks, Lisa. Same-property NOI growth for the third quarter met our expectations at 2.1%. I am happy to report that Q3, the team executed most new shop leasing in nearly eleven quarters. We continue to have success embedding contractual rent steps into our leases, as evidenced by nearly 90% of our new shop leasing, include average annual steps of 2.4%. ","This translates into strong straight-line rent spreads of 14%. Due to robust pipeline, we expect the positive leasing momentum to continue. At the same time, as we discussed in the first half of the year, the timing of leasing and move-outs earlier this year caused the decline in rent paying occupancy and in turn, lower same-property NOI growth for 2019.","In regards to tenant fallout, we are diligently monitoring watch list retailers and focused on working with potential backfills for existing and future vacancies including our IPIC Theater and Dressbarn locations, as well as tenants like Pier 1, where we have 11 locations representing 20 basis points of annual base rent. ","Foreclosures are a part of the business and our teams are discerningly back-filling these spaces, upgrading the merchandising mix and more often than not at higher rents. More importantly, as Lisa indicated, we have every reason to believe given the uniqueness of Barney's in our portfolio and the confluence of events that the elevated impact in 2020 is an anomaly.","In regards to the status of Barney's location in Manhattan, the situation remains fluid, while our store in Chelsea is one of the location that remains open for now, it's likely that when we get the space back at year-end and is a significant driver to our flat 2020 growth expectations. ","We are evaluating and pursuing alternative redevelopment plans and we feel good about the prospects for replacing the rent at this high-quality location, although this would certainly come with downtime and capital requirement. ","It's important to keep in mind that we continue to execute on proactive asset management and center repositioning across the portfolio. We remain highly focused on making astute long-term merchandising decisions, which sets up our centers for future success. Mac?","Mac Chandler ","Thanks, Jim. Our development and redevelopment opportunities remain significant and we are well-positioned to meet the strategic objective of starting $1.25 billion in value-add developments and redevelopments over the next five years. ","As retail real estate evolves, the nature of development and redevelopment is changing as well, our focus on owning and operating premier shopping centers in dense infill and affluent trade areas positions us well to capitalize on increasing opportunities for horizontal and vertical mixed-use projects.","As Lisa discussed, redevelopments are a key component for Regency to achieve 3% same-property growth over the long-term. But it's important to keep in mind that many of our current and near-term pipeline projects are larger in scale more, complex, and often include a mix of uses. ","These projects typically take longer to complete and often require NOI to come offline. But once these projects stabilized, they will add substantial incremental NOI and value to our portfolio.","With that, I'd like to provide updates on some of our larger in-process and near-term redevelopment projects. Redevelopment of our former office building at Market Common in Arlington, Virginia started in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a reminder, this outdated building was vacant when we purchased it in the adjacent retail. ","The redevelopment entails configuring the three-story building essentially into a new four-story mixed-use office and retail building. Construction is progressing smoothly. The building is topped out and will be weather typed by year-end. ","The exceptional views of the National Cathedral and execute at least with a leading luxury Fitness operator in the second quarter are very appealing features for our prospective office tenants. We anticipate tenants to begin coming online in 2021 with an estimated incremental yield of nearly 9%. ","The Abbot redevelopment located in Harvard Square started this year with the entire $1.1 million of property NOI coming offline in the first quarter. Construction is progressing nicely, particularly now the demo is complete and footings are being prepared for a ground-up building. ","Leasing activity is positive and we are in negotiations with several best-in-class retailers, fitness concepts and restaurants. We estimate initial occupancy to begin in 2021 at an estimated 9% incremental yield.","Moving now to some of our near-term pipeline projects, at Serramonte Center located south of San Francisco, we expect to commence on the next phases of our redevelopment by year-end. This consists of three components that will be staggered over the next several years. The first project is the development of a new state-of-the-art 16-screen theater, as well as a 145-room hotel ground lease, several new outparcel restaurants and relocation of our successful Crunch Fitness.","The second part of the project is a renovation of the interior of the mall, as well as several new exterior entrances. Both projects will increase foot traffic, supporting our productive in-line tenants, which now average $620 per square foot and paving the way for new retail concepts, which we look forward to announcing next year. Both projects are due to start in the next quarter.","The third component is the redevelopment of the former JCPenney box, which benefits from tremendous visibility from Interstate 280. This 75,000 square foot space sets up well for a variety of junior anchors, including a specialty grocer. Groundbreaking is anticipated in 2021.","Westwood Shopping Center in Bethesda Maryland is another large-scale redevelopment that we plan to start in early 2020. It will be converting a poorly configured giant anchored center into a vibrant mixed vertical center to include retail anchored by a new giant 200 multi-family apartments, 100 units of assisted living and approximately 84 sale town homes. ","Consistent with our strategy, we are partnering with best-in-class co-developers for the non-retail components. The Phase 1 retail should open in 2022, and the Phase 2 apartments at ground floor retail shall open a few years thereafter.","These are just some of our exciting projects in our near-term pipeline and we will provide regular updates on these and other significant projects on future earnings calls and in our supplemental disclosure. Mike?","Mike Mas ","Thank you, Mac. Let me begin with some additional color around our third quarter earnings results and updated 2019 NAREIT FFO guidance. Third quarter NAREIT FFO includes a net positive $0.02 per share impact from a combination of one-time items. ","First, a $0.01 per share negative impact from a swap breakage charge associated with the repayment of our term loan following our August bond offering. And second, an offset in $0.03 per share positive non-cash benefit from the accelerated amortization of below market rent triggered by our agreement to proactively terminate a lease with JCPenney at Serramonte.","Under the termination agreement, JC Penney will move out at the end of May 2020, which requires us to ratably amortize their below market rent through this new termination date. Therefore, we will recognize another $5 million of below market rent in Q4 of this year, in addition to the $5 million recognized in Q3, and yet another $8 million in 2020. ","Our 2019 NAREIT FFO guidance has been updated to reflect these impacts. Items like these provide a good reminder of why we use core operating earnings as a metric to better measure performance as it eliminates certain non-recurring and non-cash items more closely reflecting cash earnings and our ability to grow the dividend. ","As Lisa mentioned, we are confirming our core operating earnings growth range of 3% to 4% for 2019, and expect to finish near the top of that range.","Before wrapping up the call, let me first highlight one of the most important differentiating aspects of our business plan, our capital allocation and funding capabilities. We are fortunate to have access to many attractive funding options and now hold a positive outlook rating by both S&P and Moody's. And we are generating approximately $170 million of free cash flow annually, which funds our developments and redevelopments on a leverage-neutral basis.","In addition, given the quality of our portfolio, we can be opportunistic and fortifying our 3% same-property NOI growth objective through the sale of non-strategic lower growth assets and deploying that capital into the acquisition of shopping centers with superior growth prospects. To that end, we acquired two compelling assets this quarter and we are able to take advantage of several attractive sources of capital.","In August, we issued $425 million of 10-year unsecured notes at a Regency record low interest rate of 2.95%. We used a portion of these proceeds to repay our $300 million term loan with the balance partially funding, the $212 million Pruneyard acquisition. Our disposition guidance incorporates funding the remainder of this acquisition through the sale of lower growth assets on a tax-efficient earnings and leverage-neutral basis.","In September, we funded the Circle Marina acquisition located in Long Beach, California, through a combination of secured debt and operating partnership units, which is yet another funding source in our playbook. And lastly, we executed on our ATM program in September, selling approximately $130 million in gross proceeds on a forward basis.","As Mac discussed our development and redevelopment pipeline continues to grow and we are excited about the near-term value-add opportunities. We expect development and redevelopment spend to exceed our leveraged free cash flow in 2020 and proceeds from the forward ATM will be used to fund a portion of that spend. ","This is a compelling funding source when priced correctly as it maintains our balance sheet strength and when compared to diluted property sales.","Our flexible funding strategy is one of the many factors that contributes to Regency being well-positioned to meet our strategic objectives over the long-term, including starting $1.25 billion in value-add developments and redevelopments over the next five years, averaging same-property NOI growth of 3%, core earnings growth of 4% plus, and with dividend growth, total returns exceeding 8%.","I'll turn the call back to Hap for closing remarks.","Hap Stein ","Thank you, Mike. I'd like to take this opportunity on my last earnings call to thank not only all of the amazing Regency team members, team members that I've worked with over the last 40 years, but also to thank all the talented people in the investment community that I have interacted with throughout my career. This includes many of you who are on the phone with us today and with whom I will be able to meet with at the upcoming NAREIT. ","Our constructive dialogs have truly made a contribution to Regency's success. It has been my pleasure to work with all \u2013 you all and an awesome honor to lead this special company to where it is today. I am looking forward to stepping into my new role as Executive Chairman, supporting Lisa and our exceptional team, as they successfully achieve Regency's goals.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Greg McGinniss ","Hey, good morning. This is Greg on with Nick. Just one question from me today. You seem committed to achieving this 3% same-store NOI growth over the long-term. But I am wondering what the expected timing is on that goal? ","Or if I am just misunderstanding the growth number, because if we assume 2% same-store growth in 2018 and 2019, and then I guess, the zero to low-single in 2020. Does that mean we should be assuming nearly 5% growth from there out?","Lisa Palmer ","Hey, Greg, it's Lisa. Just to answer your question, we will be getting full guidance for 2020, all the components of it on our fourth quarter earnings call. And so, at this time we are not giving 2020 guidance. We are certainly not going to \u2013 we are certainly not going to dip our toes into 2021 or 2022 or 2023. ","But what I can tell you is just reiterate what I said on the call that, we do have confidence that we will return to achieving our strategic objectives and do that over the long-term. We have a lot of visibility to great value-creating projects in our redevelopment pipeline, some that are already in progress and those will \u2013 that value will be harvested, the timelines, they take a little bit of time. ","And interestingly, we were talking about this earlier today, even just first retenanting some of our anchor boxes, the value creation is also is highly correlated to the amount of time that it's taking to complete these projects. So, we love our portfolio. We love our development platform. We love our balance sheet. And I love our team. ","They may not all love me, but \u2013 and we are really excited about the future. We think we are really well positioned to continue to be a sector-leading owner, operator, developer of shopping centers.","Greg McGinniss ","Okay, thanks. But just to clarify, so the 3% growth is kind of an average expected per year, that's not necessarily like over a five year period, you'll be achieving that 3% growth?","Lisa Palmer ","It's over a long-term. It is an average of 3% over the long-term. I don't know that I have the exact number with me. Laura may write it down for me. But I believe that our five year average right now is 3.4% and we had several years that we were north of 4%. So, I do believe it's achievable.","Greg McGinniss ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Hap Stein ","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Christy McElroy ","Hey, good morning guys. Just following up on that flat growth expectation for 2020, is redevelopment expected to be a neutral or negative contribution? And appreciate the detail on each of kind of the larger projects. ","But wondering, if you could update us on for FFO modeling purposes, sort of those downtime impact expectations for Westwood, Serramonte, Costa Verde as that space \u2013 any space comes offline over the next two years?","Mike Mas ","Hey, Christy, it's Mike. With respect to the specific question on 2020 and the impact for redevelopments much more to come next quarter when we put our details. We are still refining our plans. But we did alluded to $4 million of NOI coming offline at two specific projects next year and Mac spent some time talking through those. ","I would also point to you to our new disclosure, I think it's Page 19 or so in our supplement. The team has done a great job of trying to provide a little bit more visibility into the impacts of downtime. And more importantly, timing around a little bit to Greg's question, when NOI will start to return for these projects that we are working through, and then Mac took some time to step through. ","Going forward, we will continue to be very descriptive on these projects, on these quarterly calls and in between \u2013 with meetings and we will be very, very sure to help everyone understand that the \u2013 it's about the ins and the outs. I would say this, we've averaged anywhere from 20 basis points to 130 basis points of positive contributions. ","Obviously 2019 has been muted. And I would say that 2020 at this point in time we anticipate to look a lot like 2019.","Christy McElroy ","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then, just in terms of the forward equity raise, you mentioned that a portion of that will go to redevelopment spend. Is the balance going to acquisitions? And how do you sort of think about kind of the source of capital in terms of dispositions versus ATM issuance? Are you kind of a seller of additional equity here or has it all been kind of prefunded for 2020?","Mike Mas ","Sure. It's a good question, and fair. It all starts with free cash flow. And as we've talked about a $170 million we are generating free cash flow given our low payout ratio. Importantly that's after CapEx, that's after dividend payments.","And then, we look into our capital plan for next year and again this pipeline that we are building of active developments and redevelopments is leading us to a need to raise a little bit more capital than that leverage neutral free cash flow will provide. So we look at our portfolio and we assess whether we need to activate any pruning beyond our typical 1% per year or so. ","And when we looked at the price, NAV is an art, not a science. We like this price with respect to our capital plan. I think, if you \u2013 if you think about consensus NAV and maybe what that implied cap rate may be and you think about our use of proceeds into developments and redevelopments averaging about 7% returns. ","We like that trade and that's how we think about managing our capital plan. Importantly, we are committed to maintaining our balance sheet. We closed the quarter at 5.5 times. We like our ratings. We like the positive outlooks that we are on with both Moody's and S&P. And we will work to preserve the strength of that balance sheet as well.","Christy McElroy ","Thank you.","Hap Stein ","Thanks, Christy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Hill ","Hey, good morning, guys. Lisa, maybe first for you, just strategically, would you changed anything with your redevelopments given what you know now about this confluence of the bankruptcies?","Lisa Palmer ","Absolutely not. These are really great projects. And now that we have some enhanced disclosure hopefully that you can see that as well and you can see why we are excited about some of these. And I think, Mac actually talking about them on the call and some of you have even had an opportunity. And we even touched on some others. ","Some of you have had an opportunity to visit some of these even or others like Town and Country. We are going to have an opportunity in Atlanta. So there is a lot of really exciting projects. And this is a \u2013 it's a marathon, it's not a sprint and we are focused on long-term value creation for our shareholders.","Richard Hill ","Got it. That's helpful and very reassuring. I do have a follow-up question. I know you're not looking to give guidance right now. And I think we had a lot of us are trying to get out on the call is the mix between, maybe how much the redevelopment versus the confluence of bankruptcies is weighing on the flat growth? ","Do you have any sense of, is it 75% of bankruptcies and 25% the redevelopment? How should we think about that mix?","Mike Mas ","You're going to hear this a lot potentially today, but Rich, more to come obviously. but let's \u2013 we can\u2019t talk about some of the facts that are out there and you should all be aware of. From a bankruptcy perspective, since 2015, we've averaged between 10 and 60 basis points of impact. If you just think about Barney's and IPIC, just as the unique bankruptcies that were up against next year, that's 80 basis points alone in two tenants. ","So, that's far exceeding what we would call regular way business. So I think keep that in mind as you think through the impacts for 2020. I think the redevelopment contribution is what it is. It's another year of given the ins and outs of NOI, another year of muted contribution, which will look a lot like 2019.","Richard Hill ","Got it. That's it for me. Thank you for the disclosure on the assets one-by-one. That's really helpful from our perspective.","Hap Stein ","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Schmidt ","Yes. Just, thinking about the small shops, roughly on average, how many months does it take you to go from a closed store to one that is open and paying rent?","Mike Mas ","Craig, I think we will probably in the \u2013 I must say eight month range. But I would say from lease execution to RCD is probably closer to four. ","Craig Schmidt ","Okay. That's helpful. And then, will you be doing any lease modifications in 2020?","Lisa Palmer ","In what sense, Greg?","Craig Schmidt ","Where you \u2013 fearing to store closing, you may negotiate lower rents to keep them in place.","Lisa Palmer ","I would \u2013 rent reduction, I think about the rent releases.","Mike Mas ","We obviously take every situation on its own. Every deal stands on its own. We are appropriate and I'd suggest one of the reasons you saw a slight tick downturn on the renewal rates was effectively we had in this particular quarter, we had a couple of deals that I would call, standing still retailers. Keeping them placed until we can get them backfilled. ","And you may take a little bit of a hit on a short-term basis to keep the space filled while you market the space. So, in general, I think, we've been pretty tough on rent reduction. Generally, we want our space back, if the tenant doesn't want to play by the rules, if you will. And we have found good success in reletting our space, when we get it back.","Hap Stein ","And that's the exception rather than the rule.","Mike Mas ","That is exception. ","Hap Stein ","It may happen, but\u2026","Mike Mas ","If it happens, it's generally very short-term in nature.","Craig Schmidt ","Okay, thank you. That is helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Shivani Sood ","Hi, good morning. Switching to the private market side, we've heard from your peers that, that the investment markets, especially for the high-quality assets you are looking for is exceptionally tight right now. ","So, if you could just comment on what you think is differentiating Regency from the peer set in the bidding process just given the higher volumes in the more accretive cap rates we are seeing year-to-date versus the initial guidance?","Mac Chandler ","Hi, this is Mac. Thanks for your question. I do agree with that observation that, in fact the market is very tight there. There are very few qualities of the type of quality that we are looking for. We have a very high bar. And you are right, we have been successful buying properties off market, not just this year, but over the last several years. ","We've got a track record for that. And I'll just use the Pruneyard as an example. That was off-market. The seller came directly to us based on our reputation and our ability to close quickly and to get our arms wrapped around it. I think an advantage is our 22 markets. We are in the market and we know these properties very well.","Circle Marina is another example where we own three centers within half a mile and we've driven past this center for many, many years. It's been on our watch list and we simply approach the owner for many years and we finally came to terms with them. So it really gives us an advantage being out in the markets and having a reputation for being able to close quickly into settle at a price that was agreed upon.","Shivani Sood ","Thanks for that color. And then, understanding the residential isn\u2019t a huge part of their redevelopment at Town and Country Center. But have the recent changes due to the rent laws in California changed how you are underwriting that or thinking about that project?","Mac Chandler ","That particular one is, is interesting in a sense that we have a 99-year ground lease with an apartment developer, who is going to develop that. And so they'll construct it. They'll own it. We have increases in that rent. So, they have no hesitation on moving forward with the project. We've been working with them for about a year now. We are into the city and we see no reason why that transaction would not close and they would commence rent as agreed upon. So, we keep an eye on it. But certainly our partner and partner in this case being the ground lessee, is \u2013 doesn't have any concerns.","Shivani Sood ","Okay. Thanks for that color.","Hap Stein ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Jeremy Metz ","Hey, good morning. Just going back to the commentary on the investment activity. Obviously recognizing somewhat of a tight market, but you've also been pretty successful year. Here you mentioned the market strategy and that's driving some additional deal flow. So, beyond what you've closed already and what you outlined on the disposition front, you have the $200 million close your guidance is $300 million. ","Do you have additional stuff either on the market for sale beyond that $300 million that we should be thinking about and on the buy, is there anything that's really kind of active in the pipeline that you are excited about that could maybe come to fruition here or early next year?","Mac Chandler ","Sure, Jeremy. This is Mac. One of the advantages of buying a center like, The Pruneyard is it gives us an opportunity to exchange a property that we sell that has an embedded tax gain. And so, we do have a couple properties that we are looking to sell, where we would exchange that gain and park it into the Pruneyard. ","However, we don't feel that we are under any pressure to close that sale. But we do have a couple transactions that are out there. And you are right that makes up about the remaining 100 million. And if it works, it's great. But, like I said, we are under no pressure to consummate that. So, we don't usually get into the exact transaction, just details to it.","On the buy side we are always in the market. We are always looking for properties. That's how we've been successful in the past and if opportunities that are compelling and meet our high or high bar for quality and income growth come our way, we'll address those as they come.","Jeremy Metz ","All right. So doesn't sound like necessarily an M&A here? And then Lisa, thanks for the initial color on 2020. On the same-store NOI expectations as we take that into account, the details you outlined, the impact from Barney's. Just thinking about managing expectations here, should we be thinking about earnings growth around a similar level to that or Is there anything positive or negative that could swing higher or lower from there?","Lisa Palmer ","Again, we'll give a lot more detailed guidance in the quarter. But as I said in the prepared remarks that we expect those to be in a similar range.","Jeremy Metz ","Got it, Mac and Lisa, thanks.","Mac Chandler ","Thanks, Jeremy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Samir Khanal ","Good morning, Mike, or Lisa. I guess on Barney's. I'm just trying to get a little bit more color, if you have that. I mean, if you were to get the space back, I mean, how long do you think you get sort of property entitlements on that and then \u2013 and get a tenant back in? And also, how should we think about the rent on that box? I know it's about 80 bucks a foot there, I mean, how should we think about the economics?","Mike Mas ","Let me start, and I'll kick it to Jim, as he maybe provide a little bit more color on how he is thinking about the space. But Samir, as we said, we are effectively planning for Barney's to be down next year. So much more to come as we roll out our guidance for 2020 and then we'll continue to report on this project as we have and enhanced our disclosure on the other projects. ","We'll treat Barney's very similarly and get as much visibility as we can to the extent of the downtime, the extent of the capital and when we anticipate that rent coming back on board. But I'll let Jim speak to what we have been doing to this point. What our thoughts might be.","Jim Thompson ","Thanks, Mike. We really like the real estate and we will be able to replace that revenue. Our team is actively engaged as we speak in evaluating the alternative scenarios. And obviously, the different uses that may be available to us. But as Mike said, much more to come, but we are diligently pursuing all the avenues at this point.","Samir Khanal ","Okay. And I guess, a follow-up maybe a big picture question, Lisa. It sounds like you're a little \u2013 you are being a little bit more active on projects sort of late in the cycle, whether it's the redevelopments, or even in the development side, maybe taking space offline even at Westwood. I guess, how are you balancing that decision to do more projects with the potential server of a \u2013 the overhang of a risk coming from an economic slowdown, given that there is a lot of economic uncertainty out there?","Lisa Palmer ","Gosh, If I knew when the next downturn was going to be, I might not be sitting at this table. I might be somewhere else. These projects are really generational projects and it's especially the redevelopments, right, real estate that we already own. And really high barrier markets, infill neighborhoods and even in what was obviously, right, the second worst recession in our country, in back in 2009, these types \u2013 this quality real estate that we own still performed really well. ","And so, we don't have our heads in the sand. We know, we realize that there is a lot of clouds out there in terms of economic uncertainty, but these projects I believe will even perform well and withstand what that the economic cycles that we know are coming.","Samir Khanal ","And they'll go through the cycles.","Lisa Palmer ","And they will go through the cycles.","Samir Khanal ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wes Golladay ","Hey, good morning to everyone. Can you give us an update on your tenant watch list? I mean, from last quarter, it sounds like it was a few percent, but now it sounds like you are cycling through a few of those tenants. So did that come down? And what is your remaining department store exposure?","Mike Mas ","Hey, Wes, this is Mike. From a watch list perspective, three is really no change quarter-over-quarter from what we've talked about in the past. Tenants, as you'd mentioned have come off the list. So, there is no longer impacts of Sears, et cetera and Barney's is now moving to a different class. But as we look forward, obviously we are \u2013 our eyes around tenants like Pier 1 and others. ","We are taking care of JCPenney as we mentioned with the termination agreement. But I would say, it's essentially pretty neutral. I'll go back to the bankruptcy history that we've absorbed into our NOI that figure, since 2015. It's been in that 10 basis point to 60 basis point range for tenants that are outside of this Barney's\/IPIC situation that we are currently looking at.","Wes Golladay ","Let me just clarify, were they on the list of the Barney's, the JCPenneys, the Pier 1s and the...","Mike Mas ","Absolutely.","Wes Golladay ","Okay. So \u2013 but is that, I mean, some backfilling now?","Mike Mas ","No. I mean, we are just generally in that same range. I would think historically it's been our watch list maybe we'll walk through that. We think about it in three categories. We obviously are financial from a bankruptcy risk perspective. And then, when we look at store closure risk and that's where you can have \u2013 we want our teams to be aware of the change that are looking to rationalize their fleets.","Generally speaking Regency does well in that regard. We typically own the centers that perform in the upper half, upper quartile of those change and in the rationalization scenario, we don't generally lose as much space as you otherwise would think.","And then lastly, we'd like to include operators to retailers who are \u2013 may not be in financial distress, or actively shrinking their fleet sizes, but maybe came through some operational changes that we just want to be aware of. You put all that together, it is probably a tick down because of the fact that we moved Sears through the list and we are going to move Barneys through the list, but it's about the same, Wes.","Wes Golladay ","Okay. And then what about the remaining department store exposure?","Mike Mas ","What is that? ","Jim Thompson","It's mainly Macy's, in a very, very low rent ","Wes Golladay ","At Serramonte?","Jim Thompson","Yes, at Serramonte","Wes Golladay ","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Vince Tibone ","Hi, good morning. What was the rationale for doing a forward equity offering versus just issuing equity through the ATM today?","Mike Mas ","Hey, Vince, this is Mike. We've used forward sales before. So we have a track record of that tool. We like that opportunity for us to best match fund our needs. So as we look to our capital plan for 2020 and we pointed this towards building redevelopment pipeline. That's in effect why we use the forward?","Vince Tibone ","And is there, is there more fees than just doing a normal offering just from my perspective I am trying to get a sense of \u2013 I get the match funding or it helps a little bit with I guess earnings dilution in the near term, but are there more fees that accompanying it forward?","Mike Mas ","On the extreme margin it is a - just a touch more fees, but it is negligible.","Jim Thompson","Yes. I mean, economically, the forward is better or else we wouldn't choose to do it.","Vince Tibone ","Got it. And then just for \u2013 and you can do this in multiple phases over the next 12 months? Or is that a one, one-period you will get the full equity raise or one day, rather?","Mike Mas ","It's at our discretion, Vince. And we will be very clear, either in the guidance that we'd roll out next quarter or on subsequent calls on our timing, as we have in the past when we've had outstanding forward issuances?","Vince Tibone ","Got it. That's really helpful. And one more, just shifting gears a little bit. Could you talk a little bit about the trends you are seeing in the small shop segment of your portfolio? Specifically, kind of, I am curious which retailers or merchandise categories are kind of moving in and out of those, of the shop space in general?","Jim Thompson ","Yes, Vince, this is Jim. As evidenced I think by the leasing progress we've made this year, I think you can see, we feel the market is still strong. Our pipeline is robust. The categories, it's really the same folks that we've been doing business with the off-price, the fitness, beauty, medical, restaurants, obviously. But it's really - we are seeing good activity across all our regions and activity remains strong. I think our fundamentals, we feel real good about our fundamentals.","Vince Tibone ","Just on the fall outside then just because I know leased occupancy has been flat throughout the year and within shops, but where has fallouts been kind of just as a result of bankruptcies? Are you seeing any weakness with mom-and-pop tenants? ","Just curious, if you elaborate a little bit more on where you've seen the kind of drop out of shop tenants, because does it sound \u2013 does it seem like the demand side is still there? But you and others across the sector have had flat to the negative shop occupancy changes of this year?","Lisa Palmer ","I am going to lead Jim to the water. I want to remind everyone that our shop percent leased is, it's at a pretty healthy level. And I think, 91.5%. ","Mike Mas ","91.6%.","Lisa Palmer ","91.6%. So, can we increase that and add occupancy, I think we can. But I also believe that of those that have reported, I think we might be the high watermark. So, that's just part of the business. And we've recently did a market showcase in Raleigh and I reminded people that were there that when we are buying a property and we do underwriting and we underwrite renewal rate we essentially say one out of every four tenants are going to fail. ","So, that's our business. And the way that we manage that is, very proactively as Jim even alluded to earlier in terms of when people are coming up for renewals, the ones that are kind of standing still, we are really evaluating. Is this a tenant that we think is going to be able to survive and not just survive, but thrive and really drive traffic and energy to our centers. ","So, I think that 91.5% and while I do believe that we could increase occupancy, if we kept it flat, I think that that would help meet our expectations.","Vince Tibone ","No, that's really helpful color. Thank you. That's all I have.","Mike Mas ","Thanks, Vince.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Mueller ","Yes, hi. In terms of the flat same-store NOI outlook for next year, can you give us a sense as to how the timing of some of the bankruptcies is expect, excuse me, expected to play out, because obviously the later that it hits in the year, the more it's going to bleed over into 2021, as well?","Mike Mas ","Hey, Mike, more to come on timing of all of our expectation supporting, what I will clarify to be flat to slightly positive, 2020 expectation. However, we all know Barney's is in bankruptcy. We all know IPIC is in bankruptcy. So, it would be safe to assume that we are taking the full brunt of that in 2020.","Michael Mueller ","Got it. That was it. Thank you.","Mike Mas ","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Tsai ","Hi, good morning. Taking into account your low payout ratio, especially compared to your peers, but acknowledging that you are using free cash or developments and redevelopments. Does this reduce the probability that you'd raise your dividend more aggressively, maybe during this period where same-store is below your longer term growth target?","Lisa Palmer ","Before Mike answers, let me remind you that to that free cash flow is after dividends.","Mike Mas ","Correct. And Linda, we are committed to \u2013 we are committed to increase in our dividend annually. We made that statement very clear. I think, we reinstituted the annual growth of around 2014 when we made the pivot from portfolio enhancement. And then what we've also said is, we are be given that low payout ratio that our dividend growth rate would approximate our earnings growth rate. ","I would say that flat to slightly positive should translate to a similar amount of dividend growth, although, we do have the flexibility and the capacity to be flexible there. So more to come. But we do anticipate that maintaining that commitment to annual dividend increases.","Linda Tsai ","Thanks for that. And then just broadly speaking, I know you're not giving guidance, but what's the general view in terms of the balance between acquisitions and dispositions for next year?","Mike Mas ","Like I said, and I\u2019ll repeat, we like our portfolio. We are \u2013 at the same time, we are committed to continued recycling of a small amount. We think that, that pays dividends going forward in our exposure to at risk tenants and in our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives of growing NOI at 3% or better. So, more to come. But I wouldn't be surprised to see guidance that is in the approximation of what we've done historically which has been in that 1% range.","Linda Tsai ","Thanks.","Mike Mas ","Thank you, Linda.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Hap Stein for closing comments.","Hap Stein ","Yes. Once again, I want to thank all my friends in the investment community.

Welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the following presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, Mr. Mas. You may now begin.","Mike Mas","Good morning, and welcome to Regency\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed in the call.","Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","We also request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Regency\u2019s team continues to produce impressive results in each key facet of our business. Our portfolio is performing at a high level as demonstrated by nearly 96% leased, including small shops at more than 91%.","As you\u2019ll hear from Brian, the team is succeeding in both growing rents and driving future rent steps which combine with the increase in rent-paying occupancy that helped us to achieve NOI growth of 4.4% for the first half of the year. This follows three years of 4% NOI growth.","The portfolio is well positioned to sustain future NOI growth by benefitting from historically low levels of new supply, robust tenant demand across our markets, the substantial purchasing power in our infiltrate areas, the drawing power of our anchors and our fresh-look initiative that is further enhancing the merchandising and place-making of our centers.","As is evidenced by the impressive performance of our end process developments, Regency\u2019s best-in-class development team continues to demonstrate its expertise by delivering exceptional shopping centers at compelling spreads to the cost of acquiring centers of comparable quality.","We know firsthand the challenges and time it takes to develop a great shopping center, particularly the best ones that are located in infiltrate areas with strong anchors. We will maintain high levels of patience, discipline, focus and persistence to ensure that Regency will continue to deliver projects that exceed the high bar we have set. Brian will discuss our development progress in more detail.","Finally, as Lisa will discuss, our balance sheet remains extremely strong and provides us with substantial flexibility. We are committed to continuing to cost-effectively finance our investments through disciplined match funding and by astutely accessing the public markets on a favorable basis. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thanks, Hap, and good morning, everyone. Our overall financial results were solid again this quarter with core FFO per share of $0.75, representing an increase of 5.6% over the second quarter of 2015. Same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 4.3% for the quarter.","Base rent continues to be the driver as move-outs remain low and commenced occupancy increased nearly 95%. Redevelopments contributed a net positive impact of 50 basis points this quarter.","Through the second quarter, same property NOI growth has exceeded expectations, though it is expected to moderate slightly over the next two quarters as we face higher comps from the back half of 2014. As a result, we have revised our full-year guidance for 2015 accordingly. We now expect same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, to be in the range of 3.6% to 4.1% and core FFO per share in the range of $2.95 to $2.99.","I also want to note two other forward-looking updates. As Brian will discuss in more detail, we lowered development start guidance for the year to a new range of $75 million to $125 million. It is important to highlight that our shadow pipeline remains robust. And this change in guidance is not indicative of projects falling out but just delayed timing and start.","One result of these delays is a reduction in development and leasing overhead capitalization for 2015 which does impact net G&A. We now expect the quarterly net G&A run rate to increase just modestly in the second half of the year. And still, we will finish the year at the upper end of our previously communicated range of $60 million to $63.5 million.","Moving to the balance sheet and our liquidity position, we continue to cost-effectively improve Regency\u2019s already strong balance sheet through organic earnings growth and discipline match funding of investments. Developments and acquisitions will continue to be funded primarily through the sales properties while equity will be used as a source of capital only when we believe it is priced favorably.","As a reminder, the forward equity offering completed in January remains outstanding. We still intend to settle a portion for the acquisition of University Commons in Boca Raton, Florida which is expected to close in September. We also plan to settle a piece of the offering when we address the refinance of our $350 million unsecured bond maturity which we paid off earlier this week using our line of credit.","After we exit our blackout, we will access the market to source new long-term debt when conditions are appropriate. But we do remain well positioned to remain patient.","To afford us the ability [ph] of providing this flexibility, we diligently monitor future commitments, including development spend and debt maturities to maintain ample capacity should an opportunity arrive or should we encounter unforeseen disruptions in the capital markets. Consistent with that objective, we amended our $800 million revolving line of credit this quarter, reducing the borrowing spread and extending the maturity date.","In all, our strong balance sheet was recognized by Moody\u2019s when they upgraded our credit rating to Baa1, validating the enhancements we\u2019ve made over the last several years. Brian?","Brian Smith","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Over the last several quarters, the hard work and talents of our local team have continued to translate into tangible operating results which is evident in the numbers again this quarter.","The operating portfolio once again benefited from historically low move-outs but also experienced the highest number of new leases signed in any quarter since 2013. This momentum pushed the same property portfolio to nearly 96% leased, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year and 20 basis points sequentially. The primary contribution was from small shops which increased over 91% this quarter. This represents a gain of 80 basis points over the prior year.","With the portfolio so highly leased, low levels of new supply and the continued demand for quality space, the team is laser-focused by driving rents and executing deals with higher and more frequent rent steps. At the same time, as part of our fresh-look initiative, we thoughtfully select the best retailer or restaurant for each space. Rent growth for shop space was double-digits for the third quarter in a row and we have successfully executed embedded rent steps in 90% of our leases over the past four quarters.","Our progress incorporating rent steps into more of our leases, coupled with our consistent rent growth, has been instrumental to our success in achieving same property NOI growth in excess of 4%, not only for four consecutive quarters but potentially four consecutive years.","Turning now to our ground-up developments, this quarter, we completed our Fountain Square project in Miami. This 180,000 square foot center is located in one of the most densely populated areas of the Miami metro market that also benefits from a huge daytime population from Florida International University. The center is anchored by Target, Publix, Ross and T.J.Maxx.","The success of this project yielding a return of over 250 basis points to market cap rates and approaching 96% lease is a good example of what our best-in-class development teams can produce. The momentum from the successful project is leading to future investment opportunities in the highly desirable Southeast Florida market.","$180 million of ground-up developments currently under construction are generating average returns of 8% and approaching 92% leased and committed. The Village at La Floresta anchored by Whole Foods and located in a master plan community in Orange County continues to impress me as it attracts top-tier operators with the ability to support higher rents and returns than original underwriting.","La Floresta will feature unique, fresh local restaurants like Mendocino Farms, Urban Plates in the best casual seafood sensation looking to grow its presence in Southern California. In addition, this project will feature place-making enhancements, including an outdoor amphitheater and permanent space for Farmers Market designed to increase shopper dwell time and enrich the retail experience.","CityLine Market in Dallas, also anchored by Whole Foods, has such strong retail demand that as phase one approaches 100% lease, we\u2019re now negotiating leases on 95% of the retail space for our phase two project soon to commence, adding to the already impressive mix of retail, restaurant and service uses.","Looking forward with the shadow pipeline of likely starts in excess of $500 million over the next few years, plus an even greater amount of additional opportunities we\u2019re working on, we expect to secure great projects that set our disciplined criteria to start an average of at least $150 million to $200 million of developments and redevelopments annually. Hap?","Hap Stein","Thanks, Brian and thanks, Lisa. In closing, I remain very proud of the progress our team is making in building a great company. The critical ingredients are portfolio, development program, balance sheet and culture are combining to make it a company that measures up to the title of Jim Collins\u2019 book, Built to Last.","Thank you for your time and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Christine McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead with your questions.","Christine McElroy","Hi, good morning, guys. Just, Lisa, I wanted to follow-up on your comments regarding the refinancing of the $350 million of unsecured that you just paid off with your line. I just wanted to get a sense for how long you expect to hold that on the line given how much accretion will obviously result from that, the longer that you do before you do another bond offering. And maybe you can give us a better sense for, again, sort of timing of the bond offering and size and expectations around you [ph] would be helpful.","Lisa Palmer","Sure. Christine, it\u2019s more important to us to secure the financing than to worry about the short-term earnings accretions. So we just need to wait till we come out of the blackout and we\u2019ll be ready to go.","But as I said in my prepared remarks, we can remain patient because we do have the flexibility to do so. But we expect to be ready as soon as possible. And as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, part of the forward equity offering, we do intend to use and address to not do as large of an offering. So the offering will be in the 250 [ph], probably to 275 [ph] range.","Christine McElroy","Okay. So you\u2019ll pull this forward offering or the proceeds, the portion of that when you do the sub bond [ph] deal?","Lisa Palmer","Correct.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And then just with Riocan embarking on a strategic alternative process with US Trust, are you familiar with that portfolio and if they did go-to market with some of that, would you be interested in it, the portion of it given the concentration [indiscernible]?","Hap Stein","Obviously, we\u2019ve read about that. Somewhat familiar with the assets. We\u2019re familiar with the assets. And we\u2019ll evaluate them. But they have to meet our criterion B, not only do something that makes sense from a financial standpoint, but also they have to be the quality criteria that we have.","Christine McElroy","Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Christine.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Schmidt","Yes. Thank you. I wondered if you could give maybe a little bit more color on the delayed timing of the starts that led to the lower development starts?","Brian Smith","Sure, Craig. So as we said, our stated objective would be to have an average annual delivery for development and redevelopment of 150 million, 200 million. But it can be one payment [ph] and that\u2019s really what you\u2019re seeing. There\u2019s no change in the project. They\u2019re all still on track. It\u2019s just difficult to know the delays which have pushed some projects in the 2016 and somewhere a flip of the coin whether it will happen in December or January, around those time periods.","So the issue isn\u2019t the opportunity. It\u2019s just the timing of the starts. But if you want to get the specifics on what exactly happened, we\u2019ve got about eight projects we\u2019re working on that we\u2019re hoping at the beginning of the year would happen in 2015. Three of them are mixed use, so you\u2019re dependent on the other uses to some extent. If there\u2019s an issue there, then you\u2019re going to get delayed as well.","Two are master plan communities where there\u2019s some issues in the master plan developers are still working out. One of them is a zoning change. And the city pushed that in 2016. One had issues with the anchors in terms of [indiscernible] being way too much risk in some of the lease terms. That looks like it has since been worked out. And then one for sure will start this year.","But as I look at what\u2019s going on as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there\u2019s no shortage of projects. We\u2019re working on $650 million of development between now and 2017 of which I\u2019d say about well $500 million are ground up.","And at this point in time, I feel confident that $350 million to $400 million are likely, it\u2019s not guaranteed, but they\u2019re looking real good, of which about $250 million to $300 million are developments.","Craig Schmidt","Hap, that\u2019s helpful. It sounds like the anchors are getting more appetite in terms of opening ground up, is that true?","Hap Stein","Well, the specialty grocers, for sure. The original grocers, they\u2019re on fire. The boxes are still cautious and conservation [indiscernible] is good for the industry. They want spaces and all the portfolios and everything, but you don\u2019t see a whole lot of box development just because the rent from those for a particular use haven\u2019t gotten back up to where they were pre-recession. But the grocery side, there\u2019s a lot activity.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Jay Carlington with Green Street. Please go ahead with your questions.","Jay Carlington","Hey, Brian. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the Florida development was leading to future opportunities in there. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?","Brian Smith","Nothing particular. It\u2019s just we get a couple of things. I would say in the developed world, success begets success. And that project is so successful that we are seeing a lot of opportunities come to us either through brokers or potential joint venture partners.","We\u2019re still working through those. But we do have a project, for example, that was target excess land that they took out to an RFP and we were successful in getting that taken care of. We won that and that will likely be a whole food development.","And then just some other things that are percolating [indiscernible] not to talk about.","Jay Carlington","Okay. And maybe just switching to JVs. I was looking at your stuff from 2010 where you had 180 properties in a JV. And I guess today, we\u2019re sitting at 119. So I\u2019m wondering where you think that number is going to be in the next five years.","Lisa Palmer","Jay, this is Lisa. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we like our stable of JV partners. And at this time, there\u2019s really no intention of significantly growing them or reducing them. So we\u2019d expect that each of our partners may - we follow the same strategy in terms of recycling. So you may see some recycling through those, but probably right about the same number of properties.","Jay Carlington","Okay. Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Mueller","Hi. Just a quick one on leasing spreads. So they\u2019re coming out high single digits this year. Last year, they were a little bit more on the low teens. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about either what was propping them up last year or why the modest deceleration.","Brian Smith","Well, it all has to do with the anchor leases, new anchor leases. We talked about last year in the second and third quarter, we had four anchor leases that their average size was greater than 40,000 square feet and the combined or the average rent gross of the four is about 135%. So as you know, the new anchor leases is what moves the needle because of the size of the spaces as well as the tax of those are all leases and have the biggest mark-to-market.","In the last three quarters, we\u2019ve done a total of three anchor leases, new anchor leases. And they\u2019ve been small. The three of those average 15,000 square feet. So with the anchors being 99% leased and our renewal rates for anchors being 90%, what we\u2019re really getting in the last three quarters is mostly renewals of anchors. And of course, renewals are fixed option rents. And they\u2019re more flattish.","The new leasing of the last three quarters has been almost entirely shop. That\u2019s why if we look at the shop rent growth, it\u2019s been double-digit the last three quarters. And in fact, this quarter, it increased 20 basis points.","And then the other thing I would just say is it\u2019s not that we\u2019re not doing new anchors leases. It\u2019s just that a lot of them are non-comparable. So where the rent growth is not getting factored into the - or where the increase in rent is not being considered rent growth.","An example will be [indiscernible] centered up in Baltimore center up there. There, we\u2019ve got a Staples box that we\u2019re splitting and re-leasing both spaces. And the cash spreads on that are greater than 50%. But that kind of stuff is not showing up in rent for [indiscernible] is not considered non-operable.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s good color. Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Rich Moore","Yes. Hi, guys, good morning. It\u2019s been a long earnings season. And Brian, I thought I heard you say, but I probably didn\u2019t that you\u2019re thinking you\u2019re going to do 4% plus same-store NOI growth for the next four years? That\u2019s fantastic, guys.","Lisa Palmer","I think, Rich, that was in Hap\u2019s opening comments. And I think he mentioned that we have done 4% for three consecutive years. And 4% is in the realm of possibility for this year given our range of 3.6% to 4.1%.","Hap Stein","We should make it 4% in consecutive years.","Rich Moore","All right, I got you. I got you. So this is the best guidance I\u2019ve ever heard. But I want to ask you guys, the occupancy level that you\u2019re at that I have is a record for all the years that I\u2019ve been keeping track of you. Is that as high as you can go? I mean is there sort of like the space remaining, a small shop space remaining or whatever it is, not terribly leasable at this point that\u2019s left over?","Brian Smith","I don\u2019t think so, Rich. I mean we increase shops 80 basis points year-over-year. And the leasing environment remains really strong. Demands clearly exceed supply. The renewals as I mentioned are very strong. They\u2019re 81% for the portfolio.","But also the highest renewal rate we\u2019ve ever had for the shop for our pipeline of new leasing is also everybody is strong as it has been. In fact, it\u2019s a little bit higher than the last four quarter rolling average.","And we did the highest number of leases, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this quarter, that we\u2019ve ever done. So rents are still rising. Pricing power is good. We\u2019re seeing the retailers taking tougher spaces. We\u2019re seeing improvements in the weaker markets. So I don\u2019t know why we can\u2019t just keep going.","Lisa Palmer","And Rich, I\u2019ll add a little bit of color to that. We\u2019ve done some analysis. We have a lot of history. And with our existing portfolio, when you look at the properties that we reached our peak prior in the 2007-2008 range, when you look at the properties that we still own today that we owned then - and that\u2019s not counting the really high quality properties that we\u2019ve added through acquisition and development.","We actually sustained north of 96% with those properties for over a year. So we\u2019ve significantly improved the quality of our portfolio over the past five to six years. And I think with that, we should be able to sustain a higher peak than we have in the past.","Brian Smith","One thing I will add about the environment too, just a little bit of color from my perspective is, I think this is the best environment for landlord that we\u2019ve seen, not necessarily for developers, but for landlords.","And it\u2019s not because it\u2019s easy and retailers are getting and opening stores wildly. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. It is really a battle. The retailers fight hard, which is why it\u2019s taking us longer to get spaces leased and then to rent paying. You\u2019re seeing them taking approvals backed committee where they\u2019re changing their return threshold. In tenants that we signed leases, it went maybe a dozen leases. One start from scratch on the lease negotiation.","So I think that\u2019s just really healthy for the sector that retailers are cautious and deliver - but they have a desire to grow. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why the growth in supply is still limited.","Hap Stein","We totally agree. And that\u2019s important. It is a very healthy environment from our perspective.","Rich Moore","It\u2019s great color. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I\u2019ll turn the floor back to management for closing comment.","Hap Stein","We appreciate your time and your interest in Regency, and wish that everyone has a great rest of the week and weekend. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, you may begin.","Laura Clark","Good morning and welcome to Regency\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; and Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.","I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important books factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements.","On today\u2019s call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com.","Lastly, we will be hosting an Investor Day on January 11 in New York. Invitations with additional details are forthcoming and we look forward to seeing you there.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are gratified to see that even with the more challenging retail environment, Regency\u2019s portfolio continues to perform well with leasing levels over 96% and year-to-date same property NOI growth of 4%, evidence that Regency\u2019s well-merchandised shopping centers, located in trade areas with substantial buying power, are positioned to attract better retailers, which are actively and selectively expanding their bricks-and-mortar footprint. In the ever-changing world of retail, it remains apparent that a well-located physical presence will continue to be critical to efficiently service customers.","Following the close of Amazon\u2019s acquisitions of Whole Foods, Whole Foods is reengaged and actively expanding, again. We believe this is a validation by the world\u2019s preeminent online platform that bricks-and-mortar is a critical component to a retailer success. And winning grocers, retailers, restaurants and service providers want to be located with other better operators in centers conveniently located in neighborhood and communities with strong purchasing power.","While certainly not immune to accelerated store closures, in a more deliberate manner, tenants are expanding. We remain extremely confident in Regency\u2019s ability to sustain growth in same property NOI, earnings, NAV and shareholder value at or near the top of our peer group as we benefit from the following. First, owning a high-quality portfolio distinguished by trade areas with superior demographics and barriers to entry, highly productive grocers with average sales of $650 per square foot, relevant merchandising and place making, and a necessity service convenience and value focus.","Second, a conservative balance sheet that will be critically important -- will be a critically important advantage in either allowing us to profit from compelling investment opportunities or endure challenging economic and financial conditions. And most important of all, Regency\u2019s exceptional and deep team, guided by our special culture, coupled with our value add asset management development and redevelopment capabilities.","Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to let you know how fortunate we are that our properties and especially our people fared relatively well in Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and how much we appreciate their extraordinary efforts that enabled us to keep operating and to recover so quickly. Jim?","Jim Thompson","Thank you, Hap, and good morning. As Hap indicated, in spite of store closures that are garnering headlines and a more deliberate pace new store openings, our portfolio continues to perform well as retailer demand for top-quality space remains healthy.","In the third quarter, same property percent leased increased 20 basis points sequentially to 96.1%. The majority of this growth came from shop tenants where we experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy and at 92.5% leased. New rent spreads during the quarter were over 17% and we continue to have great success negotiating embedded rent steps in our new leasing transactions. Almost all new shop leases include annual rent steps averaging 2.5%.","Tenant improvements and landlord work, as a percentage of average rent, continued to be in line with prior years. While move-outs remains at historic low levels, we are certainly aware of the potential for future store closures and are monitoring tenant performance and health.","As you know, we\u2019ve been in a heightened retail bankruptcy environment for nearly 3 years. During this time, Regency\u2019s portfolio has continued to outperform posting same property NOI growth in excess of 3.5% with occupancy levels exceeding 96%. Our exposure to tenant bankruptcies and store closures has been minimal. And when we have received spaces back, we\u2019ve had success in re-leasing to better operators at higher rents. We have leased or are in lease negotiation for nearly all of the spaces returned to us, following bankruptcy over the past 2 years.","This year alone, out of our 9,000-plus tenants, we have only 21 store closures expected from BK [ph]. While we\u2019re closely monitoring trends and have ongoing communication with our top retailers, our track record demonstrates the portfolio\u2019s ability to withstand and succeed in this ever-evolving and challenging retail environment.","I will now turn the call over to Mac.","Mac Chandler","Good morning, everyone. We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which were growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio. Our in-process projects are performing well and attracting strong retailer demand as evidenced by gains and percent leased.","For example, The Village at Tustin Legacy in Orange County is 97% leased and committed. The majority of our tenants are now open including Starter Bros. and CVS, both of which reported strong brand openings. In addition, our 2 Whole Foods projects in the Northeast as well as our Wegmans project in Metro DC are approaching 90% leased and committed. And at Serramonte Center in the Bay Area, our 250,000 square foot expansion is substantially complete.","All six of our new junior anchors have opened, traffic is up and the overall center is performing well. Subsequent to quarter end, we started Midtown East, a Wegmans\u2019 anchored ground-up development in the affluent Midtown neighborhood of Raleigh. Midtown East will be Wegmans first store in the state of North Carolina.","Regency\u2019s first-class team continues to source compelling development opportunities and mine potential redevelopments, as starts were in line with expectations. Although the development landscape remains challenging, our industry-leading platform is well positioned to create value for both new development as well as redevelopment opportunities within our portfolio. We look forward to discussing future development and redevelopment opportunities in more detail at our Investor Day.","Moving to dispositions and acquisitions. We are executing on our plan to sell 1% to 2% of our assets annually. Through October, we have closed approximately $45 million of properties and anticipate closing on an additional $180 million by only 2018. Looking back, we have been very successful implementing capital recycling to further enhance the quality of our portfolio by supplementing cash flow to fund the development and redevelopment, and reinvesting into attractive acquisition opportunities offering superior future growth. This recycling has resulted in a fortified NOI growth profile with greater long-term value creation and reduced exposure to disruptors, as evidenced by the minimal impacts we have experienced from tenant bankruptcies. We plan to continue to execute on our capital recycling initiatives on a basis that mitigates earnings dilution and the impact from the embedded tax gains associated with our dispositions.","On the acquisition front, valuations pricing are strong from the quality centers we own, develop and buy. As you can see from our increased to guidance, we have recently sourced compelling opportunities that meet our high standards for quality and growth, and will match the timing of our targeted dispositions. The centers, which are in various stages of due diligence, are located in our target markets of Seattle, San Diego and New York, all benefit from strong demographics, productive anchors and best-in-class shop tenants. These investments, along with the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past, our valued at approximately $225 million with anticipated closing dates spread over the next several months. I look forward to sharing more details on these premier centers in subsequent quarters after we have closed.","I will now turn the call over to Lisa.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Mac. The team posted another really good quarter. And most importantly, I want to echo Hap\u2019s comments, we are so grateful that our team members are safe following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and that our property sustained minimal damage. And I also want to reiterate our thanks to the team for their amazing efforts following the hurricanes. In the third quarter, we did take a onetime charge of approximately $1.9 million or $0.01 per share related to repair and cleanup work caused by these hurricanes. Consistent with our practice for nearly 10 years, gains and losses in our captive insurance program have been excluded from same property NOI. Therefore, the charges incurred this quarter are excluded from same property NOI and given the non-comparable nature of events, the charges also added back to core FFO.","Turning to 2017 guidance. We are maintaining our same property NOI growth of 3.2% to 4% for the full year. The lower growth rate in the fourth quarter is driven by an anticipated decline in percentage rent, driven by a handful of tenants, as well as the tough other income and bad debt expense comp. Although we have experienced a moderate increase in bad debt expense year-to-date, it\u2019s important to remember that 2016 levels were far below historical norms and current projections are more in line with long-term averages. We have also decreased our net G&A guidance for the full year by approximately $4 million at the midpoint. With the merger, we plan to hire 70 new positions, but these additions took just a little bit longer to fill than initially expected. We have now filled these positions and expect next year\u2019s net G&A to be in the $67 million range. Despite this delay in hiring, the merger integration has progressed extremely well. And at $67 million of net G&A in 2018, we will realize the $27 million in synergies.","Lastly, we have raised our full year NAREIT FFO and core FFO guidance, reflecting the later timing of our dispositions this year and the lower than expected net G&A expense.","This concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Katy McConnell","This is Katy McConnell, on for Christy. Can you update us on the timing of anchor commencements, which are largely released at this point, and the CapEx that is involved in backfilling some of that space. And then maybe if you could talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the potential for further tenant fallout as we go into 2018.","Lisa Palmer","Katy, this is Lisa. I\u2019ll let Jim handle more detail, if he wants to add some color. But just from a general perspective, if you think about -- when we look at our same property NOI growth, an important thing that we can see, which you all can see, is that our base rank growth contribution to that in the first half of the year was in the mid-3s and that\u2019s accelerating in the back of the year to the high 3s. And some of that is driven by these anchor rent commencements. So I mean, I think, that that\u2019s one of the key factors. And from the capitals, we\u2019re seeing really healthy net effective rent growth. So even though it is taking some capital to prepare the boxes, we\u2019re seeing rent growth at really, really healthy robust levels.","Jim Thompson","Yes. Katy, the only thing I would add is Sports Authority. We had five -- we have four leased and the fourth one will commence, all of them will commence rent by the end of this month. So we\u2019re in good shape on our relets.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Schmidt","I just wondered, in terms of a feeling in the transaction market, it looks like you have a number of high-quality general markets closing soon. Are people more willing to strike deals before the end of the year? Or are you seeing little change in terms of just the cadence and appetite for transactions?","Mac Chandler","Thanks, Craig. This is Mac. There is a typical seasonality that goes with transactions where people do want to transact by the end of the year. I don\u2019t see that being different this year versus past years. But there certainly is a steady appetite for people to transact both on buying and selling, so not a big shift that we\u2019re seeing in that regard. So no, not a whole lot of color to add to that question.","Craig Schmidt","And we are seeing some of the projections for holiday \u201817 that seem relatively robust to past years. Are you hearing any of that same sentiment when you deal with some of the retailers?","Mac Chandler","Well, in terms of retailer expansion, is that you\u2019re talking about, Craig?","Craig Schmidt","No. I just -- are they feeling better? I mean, we\u2019ve heard that Halloween was up this year and that holiday 2017, depending on which estimate, anywhere from 3.5% to 4.5% sales?","Hap Stein","It is early to tell. I think, when you look at the demand, our demand for space continues to be very robust. And that, to me, translates to retailers are doing -- continue to do business and are comfortable growing their business to the better spaces. I mean, they are being more deliberate. They are being more selective. But the successful operators and tenants are continuing to expand at a -- in pretty active pace.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And Hap, congratulations on the ULI Visionary Award.","Hap Stein","Craig, thank you very much. It -- as you know, in my case, it really does take quite a team.","Craig Schmidt","Yes. Well, it just means that because you\u2019re such a great visionary, you\u2019ll provide excellent guidance next quarter.","Hap Stein","I\u2019ll do whatever Lisa lets me do.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.","Mike Mueller","I guess, a quick question on operating trends, meaning the same-store stats and occupancy and everything, really positive in your rent spreads there. Nice and healthy. But it looks like there was some moderation that occurred over the past several quarters, and just wondering what\u2019s the color behind that? Is it just your things are good, but you\u2019re just bumping up against tough comps? Does it feel like you\u2019re in a level -- opposites level or we could see a little bit more on the moderation front? I mean, just any color there would be helpful?","Lisa Palmer","Mike, good morning. I\u2019ll answer on the same property NOI growth trend line, and then I\u2019ll let Jim address rent spreads because I think that that\u2019s -- those are the two areas that would appear to be moderating. I\u2019ll reiterate what -- how I started with my answer to Christy or to Katy in that our base rent growth is actually accelerating throughout the year, so the same property NOI growth moderation that we\u2019re seeing is some noise in some of the other line items. We\u2019re up against tough comps for other income as well as bad debt expense, and we\u2019re expecting a decline in percentage rent. ","And some of that -- once translated and transitioned the base rents, so that is driving some of that base rent growth, but we\u2019ll take base rent growth -- we\u2019ll take base rent over percentage rent any day. So we\u2019re not necessarily seeing a moderation in same property NOI growth. It\u2019s just timing throughout the year. I think, as you know, quarterly numbers are not going to be smooth. There is some lumpiness. We feel really good about our guidance range of 3.2% to 4%.","Jim Thompson","Yes. I think as to rent growth specifically, obviously, as I mentioned, our new growth was 17% for new deals and renewals were at 57%. And there\u2019s a couple of things going on in renewal. We had a very large pool, almost 84% renewed this past quarter. Several anchors were embedded in that renewal pool that had flat option renewals which, obviously, drove the average down. When you kind of look at the deals we were able to negotiate, we were at 10% -- we drove at 10% rent growth number, which I\u2019m very comfortable with and is consistent with expectation.","Lisa Palmer","And at the same time, we know that we\u2019re in a really challenging retail environment. And if we can achieve high single-digit rent spreads, we\u2019ll be really happy with that.","Hap Stein","We\u2019ll take it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Looking at your occupancy, it\u2019s pretty high right now. Are you becoming more selective on who you allow into the center? And how is the quality of the demand overall versus prior years?","Jim Thompson","This is Jim. Again, I think the -- our pipeline is robust, continues to be very solid, so we are seeing good demand. Yes, we are -- we continue to be selective in our merchandising. I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ve taken a lot of pride in over time. So we continue to look for the best retailers in given categories and folks that, we believe, will be relevant in the future in this changing environment, and we\u2019re finding good retail demand at this point.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then some of the peers have commented on delayed tenant openings. Are you experiencing this to any degree?","Jim Thompson","As Hap mentioned, I think deals are taking longer from start to finish. A lot of negotiations. Good retailers -- know the good retailers and we feel like we\u2019ve got good product and we know good retailers want to be in good product, and what that turns into is a detailed negotiation process.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then, lastly, the company acquired, Equity One, they used to have a slide in their presentation called 50th birthday of grocery shopping centers, where they would get big upticks in this flat rents for the past 50 years. Are you seeing any of those roll next year or anything that will be meaningful on the new lease side?","Lisa Palmer","Wes, this is Lisa. Just very generally, if you recall, when we first announced the merger and talked about the strategic benefits of the merger, one of the key items is the fact that we believe that it would be accretive to our same property NOI growth, which has proven out. And as a result of the fact that there was some embedded mark to market in the leases, and we are beginning to see some of those. Yes. And more to come for 2018, but expect that we\u2019ll see some more benefit next year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors.","Vince Tibone","The spread between physical and leased occupancy continues to widen in the quarter in a range wider than some of the recent norms. It\u2019s -- this is usually partly driven by some the Sports Authority leases you mentioned earlier, but is that the only reason? And when we expect that spread to kind of tighten to where it has been in the past?","Lisa Palmer","Again, I\u2019ll let Jim give specific color, if he\u2019d like to add after. But we\u2019re at 240 basis points currently, we\u2019re only at 220 a quarter, so it hasn\u2019t increased that much. It would not be related to Sports Authority because those were already leased. So it will be related to some other new redevelopments that are underway because, if you will recall, we\u2019re already 98% leased in our anchor boxes. So it\u2019s 1 or 2 anchor deals, and Jim can talk about those. But we\u2019ve, historically, we\u2019ve been in a range of -- I think maybe once, 1 quarter we\u2019ve had that 150. But we\u2019re typically in the 200 -- 180 to 250 range, so it\u2019s not out of the norm.","Jim Thompson","Right. Lisa hit on it. So it\u2019s predominantly redevelopment with Serramonte being a big part of that, 40 basis points kind of baked into Serramonte. And then, obviously, the new leasing that we\u2019ve done in the last quarter, too, adds to that number. The good news is, obviously, that\u2019s a good tailwind going into 2018.","Vince Tibone","And then one more on just acquisitions. It sounds like all of them this year are going to be in coastal market. Is that solely where you\u2019re focusing your external growth? Or would you consider acquisitions in high -- of high-quality assets in secondary markets? Like how do you think about what is the appropriate cap rate spread between coastal and non-coastal major markets?","Hap Stein","So Vince, as you\u2019re aware, our target markets include not only the gateway coastal markets, but also the standard markets and growth markets, so 24 terrific markets throughout the country. We really, really liked the canvas in which we are able to own, operate, buy and invest. And we would certainly buy and invest in -- and interested in a Raleigh as we would -- or a Denver as we would in a coastal market. Just where these opportunities -- most of which we\u2019ve been able to negotiate on a negotiated basis, which we\u2019re real pleased with. And to a certain extent, there is a difference between markets from a cap rate and from a development return standpoint, but you have other issues related to the quality of the trade area and a trade area with strong barriers to entry and population density and above average household income and a strong anchor, is going to portray pretty strongly in pretty much every market throughout the country, and we\u2019re also looking at what\u2019s the embedded growth rate that\u2019s going to be there. From a development standpoint, it depends on the risk involved and where the project is and when we get involved from a return standpoint. I don\u2019t know if you have anything that you want to add to that, Mac?","Mac Chandler","It\u2019s really a case-by-case basis. It\u2019s really almost more about the immediate trade area and the customers being served and the job growth, than it is the greater metro area. And that\u2019s -- so we\u2019re looking at all these different markets. And by having a local presence in these markets, that really gives us an advantage. Some of these -- four out of five acquisitions that we\u2019re targeting were off market, as Hap said. So we\u2019ve sourced these directly and we think that\u2019s a real competitive advantage.","Lisa Palmer","If I may, and Mike is far enough away from me that he can\u2019t kick me. I don\u2019t want to take any of our material that we plan to share at Investor Day. But we have done a lot of work for what we call our DNA project and would be very similar to what one house on the street has like a tabbed score. And we think that it\u2019s, as Hap mentioned and Mac both mentioned, it\u2019s really important the quality of the center and then that has to actually interact with the quality of the market. And we do have internal guidelines and thresholds and return thresholds related to those scores, if you will. So we do look at it that way and we will share more detail when we have are Investor Day in January.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Tsai","In your opening remarks you discussed how Whole Foods is expanding post acquisition by Amazon. Do you have any color on how these stores might be different from when the stores were just owned by Whole Foods? What\u2019s the Amazon influence, if you have any thoughts there?","Mac Chandler","Well, it\u2019s -- Linda, this is Mac. It\u2019s pretty early and they\u2019re not -- they play their cards very close to the vest by design, so we don\u2019t have a lot of great color to give you. What I can tell you is we\u2019ve been working on a redevelopment in suburban Virginia, very good quality location. They confirmed that lease. They had time to think about it. They recently stepped up to it. So we\u2019re seeing good positive signs about that, a lot of good body language, but you\u2019re not going to get a lot of details at this point. But we have close relationship with them and their teams and their brokers throughout the markets, and they are engaged. So we\u2019re working on future opportunities, but still too early to say if their format is going to change dramatically. We hear lots of little things, but we haven\u2019t actually seen anything physically.","Hap Stein","The Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods is a really good thing for Whole Foods. They\u2019re reengaged. They\u2019re expanding a combination, I\u2019d say, robustly, but still on a very rational basis. So we feel very, very good about future prospects to continue to do business with a grocer who is a terrific anchor as far as attracting better shops, retailers, restaurants and service users.","Linda Tsai","And then any changes in the average length of leases that are being signed?","Mac Chandler","I\u2019ve heard discussion about that from my friends in the industry talking about, but more on the mall and fashion, et cetera, but we have not seen anything to date with the community neighborhood retailers.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time, so I\u2019d like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Stein for any additional concluding comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate your interest and your involvement. And hopefully, you didn\u2019t stay up too late watching the World Series last night and your team won or enjoyed what was a great World Series. Thank you very much. Take care. Enjoy the rest of the week. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, Lisa Palmer. Please go ahead.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon everyone. Good morning to those of who are on the West Coast. Thank you for joining us. On the call this afternoon are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Bruce Johnson, CFO; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","As always before we start, I\u2019d like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Hap?","Martin Stein","Thank you Lisa and good afternoon and good morning to those, not on the East Coast. I\u2019m extremely encouraged by the continued and significant progress that is been made towards the key objectives in all aspects of our business. We realized another quarter of improving operating fundamentals. It is gratifying that these results are meeting Regency\u2019s higher performance standards. While Brian will spend more time in this area, I want to highlight a few key accomplishments that are evidenced of the quality of the portfolio and the focus of Regency\u2019s management team. Leasing volumes remain robust. We continue to strengthening of our smaller shop spaces. Percent leased reached 94% for the first time since 2008.","Bad debt expense is still trending towards pre-recession levels. And pricing power well uneven is steadily moving in our favor. These improved underlined fundamentals translated in the same property NOI growth on a year-to-date basis of 3.8%.","In addition to the positive operating results of our portfolio, the $300 million of developments started since the beginning of 2009, continue to register impressive performance. Currently they are more than 90% leased with projected average returns on the incremental basis of 9.3%. I really like the four developments started this year, which will ultimately represent an investment of close to $150 million and create meaningful value for our shareholders.","These new developments reflect latencies narrowed focus on building and redeveloping dominant in field shopping centers with demonstrated demand from best-in-class retailers. Substantial progress was made on executing our clearly articulated capital recycling strategy; it has also enabled us to further strengthen the balance sheet. Last week, we closed on the $321 million portfolio sale. Bruce and Brian will describe this in more detail as well as how this and other recent impending recycling transactions are enhancing what was already a higher quality portfolio and its future NOI growth.","Together with acquisitions to date and those in our pipeline, we will have meaningfully increase the allocation of capital to dominant centers with good prospects in core markets while lowering our exposure to nonstrategic assets and markets, and reducing debt. We think caution with the balance sheet to lower leverage makes sense given the uncertainty that we are all experiencing and seeing in today\u2019s world.","Most important of all, despite the dilutive impact from the portfolio sale being a significant net seller and operating at a lower level of leverage we will be even better positioned the compound per share Core FFO including moderate growth in 2013 by sustaining growth 2.5% to 3.5% from our portfolio of dominant centers with annual gross or anchor sales averaging more in $26 million and $500 per square foot and Trade area household incomes of approximately $100,000 in average population densities of 100,000 people and those aren\u2019t future targets that\u2019s the existing portfolio and a key metrics of full network portfolio.","Bi-annually developing a $150 million to $200 million of dominant shopping centers at compelling returns on invested capital brings a unique combination of in house capabilities, presence in key markets, anchoring retailer relationships, an impressive track record. And opportunistically enhancing and already solid balance sheet in excess to capital and lastly by continuing the focus energy from our dedicated and talented team towards achieving these critical goals and objectives. I also want to note that since the portfolio sale was at a minimum NAV neutral in the short term the growth we are generating NOI and the value being created from developments should translate into 5% plus growth in per share NAV this year and into the future. Bruce.","Bruce Johnson","Thank you Hap good afternoon everyone. From our financial results perspective we had a really good second quarter. Core FFO per share was $0.69 which was higher than our stated guidance range. Continued improvement in operating fundamentals was a principal driver with same property NOI growing by 3.6% this quarter \u2013 85% of the same property growth came from increased space rent and the remainder was mostly lower bad debt expense.","As we mentioned in last quarter\u2019s call, we changed the fiscal year of our captive insurance company to end in April. As a result, we recognized the revenue in the second quarter of this year rather than in the third quarter as we\u2019ve done in prior years. This was incorporated in our second quarter guidance and made up the majority of the current quarter increase and other income. Going forward, the revenue will be recognized quarterly in an estimated run rate of between 600 and $1 million and as always will not be included in the same property NOI.","On the capital market side, we extended our option to draw the remaining balance of the term loans of January 2013. After quarter end we used the proceeds from the portfolio to pay down the $120 million of our revolving credit facility and to pay off the $150 million balance in our term loan, but still retain the right to draw the remaining commitment of $100 million. The net result is accessing nearly $700 million of available capacity. Our balance sheet is now in even better shape with no significant near-term maturities. And given today\u2019s uncertain, the uncertainty of today\u2019s world, we intend to preserve a substantial portion of the increased availability in our bank facilities to opportunistic capital market activity.","Turning to the portfolio sale, this was an important transaction that will provide us with long-term benefits. To summarize a few key details of the sale; we sold 15 properties to an affiliate of Blackstone, representing 2.1 million square feet for $321 million. The properties were wholly-owned, unencumbered and 90.5% leased. And as part of the transaction we\u2019ve retained a $47.5 million preferred equity investment in the portfolio that earns a 10.5% annual return.","The investment is callable by Regency after 12 months and by either party after 18 months. With this sale, we took advantage of an opportunity to efficiently accelerate the disposition of non-strategic assets, and reduce leverage. The dilutive impact of this accelerated capital recycling, and lower leverage is partially offset by improved NOI overgrowth, allowing us to maintain a lower end of the range of core FFO per share guidance.","We also increased guidance for percent leased, which is now 93.5% to 94.5%. While we expect same property NOI growth to moderate in the third and fourth quarters from our year-to-date rate of 3.8%,we have increased our full-year guidance to 2.8% to 3.8%. Brian?","Brian Smith","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. While we are certainly aware of the weakened economy, and are closely monitoring our portfolio, we\u2019ve yet to see any signs of deteriorating tenant health or shrinking retailer demand for space. The leasing volumes remain very strong including the developments we leased more than 2.1 million square feet of space on a gross basis including almost 1 million square feet of new leases. To put that in context, that\u2019s nearly 60% more than the quarterly average of total new leasing since 2006. We have substantial net absorption in the operating portfolio picking up a 160,000 square feet of leased space in the quarter and building on the momentum of the previous three quarters.","In fact, when compared to the second quarter of last year, same-property percent leased increased to 170 basis points, which represents a half million square feet of net absorption. What\u2019s even more notable are the gains we\u2019ve made and are continuing to make in small shop leasing. Spaces less than 10,000 square feet gained 280 basis points year-over-year and are now 87% leased. All signs point to a continuation of this progress. Our pipeline and leasing activity remains robust and as a percentage of vacant space, it is even stronger than it was at this time last year. Rent growth increased and average base rents for shop space were positive, both for the fifth consecutive quarter.","And accounts receivable balances over 90 days continue to fall and are now less than three-tenths of a percent of revenues. I say this really just to give you a further indication of the health of our tenants. Lisa, Bruce, Hap and I have the good fortune to work with a team of experience and diligent asset managers, who are proactively monitoring our tenant\u2019s health. So the well publicized Supervalu issues have certainly not caught us by surprise. What we\u2019ve learnt from prior tenant failures is that the underlying real estate can provide insulation to the poor performance or bankruptcy of individual operators.","With respect to the Supervalu exposure in our portfolio, we believe that significant majority of their stores are in high quality properties, where we anticipate readily finding good replacements. And in most cases, we would expect the rent spreads to be positive since our current Supervalu leases are on average more than 20 years old.","Turning to developments, I would like to take a moment to reiterate our development strategy. Development is a core competency and a competitive advantage sets us apart in a way to create value for our shareholders. Our right-sized and more disciplined strategy is focused on creating dominant shopping centers intended to be held long term and located in target markets with instilled characteristics. The performance is more than $300 billion of development, redevelopment, and expansion starts in the last few years underscores the success of the strategy. Developments and value add redevelopments started since 2009 are currently over 90% leased and committed and have generated an average return on invested capital of 9.3% and that\u2019s with three quarters of these projects still under construction.","As you know these returns from high-quality centers would be impossible to replicate through acquisitions. Further the properties that were in process at the end of 2011 have gone from 58% to 85% leased in the first two quarters of this year. That\u2019s a lot of leasing in the short period of time, and reflective of the quality of developments. And looking at this quarter\u2019s two new development starts, the first Erwin Square in Durham, North Carolina is a (inaudible) center. This is an excellent infill opportunity and established business district adjacent to Duke University. Already nearly 75% of the centers either leased or committed with Harris Peter as the anchor, and many best-in-class retailers taking shop space.","The second Grand Ridge Plaza located in one of the most desirable areas of Seattle, Washington is a much anticipated infill town center positioned next door to a planned Microsoft campus, and part of a high-end master plan community. With average household incomes in excess of $130,000 and extreme development barriers, this is a prime example of the type of community center development that we would undertake. Anchor tenants include Safeway, Regal Cinemas Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Alter and Marshall\u2019s Home Goods combination store.","Despite having just broken ground, we have leases in various stages of negotiation for over 90% of the leasable area including executive with top notch local and national operators.","Now I\u2019d like to share some color on the portfolio sale, in essence the portfolio was comprised of properties that are not consistent with our current investment strategy and don\u2019t enjoy the long term NOI growth potential of the vast majority of our existing portfolio or of the shopping centers that we are buying and developing.","Population densities and average household incomes for these assets are 55,000 people and $80,000 respectively compared to roughly a 100,000 people in incomes of $100,000 for our portfolio as a whole.","Grocery sales for the portfolio assets averaged $21 million compared to $26 million for our total portfolio. Several of the centers located in non-core markets like California Central Valley and Inland Empire and Akron, Ohio. In some instances we had concerns regarding the amount of shop space, rents in relation to market, the suitability or productivity of the anchor tenant and co-tenancy and kick-out issues.","On the acquisition front, we\u2019re negotiating the purchase of four dominant shopping centers, if we are successful; Regency\u2019s total investment for the centers will be in the $200 million range. Each is an exceptional property with superior growth prospects that together are expected to compound NOI in excess of 3%.","The average household incomes in three mile populations of these centers are well above those of the properties we\u2019ve sold and most importantly, grocery sales for the four centers average $1,000 per square foot. Given these attributes we expect the dominant shopping centers that we\u2019re buying to generate substantially higher NOI growth and those being still being sold. In time the compounding higher NOI growth rate will overcome the initial earnings dilution and ultimately outperform. In summary, I\u2019m proud of the results that the team has produced so far this year, by continuing to fill our vacancies with proven operators, acquiring and developing dominant shopping centers and disposing non-core centers, I believe the portfolio is in great shape and should be more resilient in the next downturn. Hap?","Martin Stein","Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Bruce. In closing, while one cannot ignore the uncertainty in the macro-environment, I\u2019m extremely encouraged about the continued and significant progress that is being made to our key objectives of growing NOI, of creating value, and dominant centers to disciplined development, of enhancing the quality of the portfolio and its NOI growth with focused recycling and of strengthening the solid balance sheet with reliable access to capital, which when we combined will translate into growth in per share core funds from operations and NAV.","It is gratifying that these results are meeting Regency\u2019s high performance standards and positioning us well for the future whether it would be prospering in a growing economy even if the growth is sluggish or weathering another recession. We thank you for joining us on the call and now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first caller from Paul Morgan, Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good afternoon. On the dispositions, I\u2019ve just a couple of questions. First in terms of the Blackstone deal, why did you put the lifestyle centers there in Texas and did that with those at below the cap rate of the average, I mean and if so. If not is there a pinch of roll down there and maybe the cap rate looks higher than it otherwise would be for certain newly developed centers. And then second why the sale of the San Pedro asset?","Martin Stein","The San Pedro asset, I\u2019ll start with that I mean that was in a partnership and partner center was timed to sell and we had major capital improvements to in effect maintain and continue to the NOI growth rate on that asset. We put together this portfolio and we felt it was \u2013 bottom line, we\u2019re pleased with the sale that occurred and not because we feel that we sold Blackstone a bill of goods but because it really \u2013 the sale met our objectives. It was an efficient transaction, with certainty of closed and the assets as Brian mentioned is not \u2013 is not up to the standards as far as 100,000 householder income, the supermarket sales in our portfolio and density. And as Brian said that \u2013 they don\u2019t have the growth potential.","And there is some risks which obviously Blackstone is very aware of including the anchor co-tenancy in shops placing for example, I\u2019ll talk about the one \u2013 one of the Lifestyle centers there the shops that have in village, as you may and may not be aware, Blackstone is added or signed a lease with Whole Foods to go in there and we\u2019re obviously aware Whole Foods interest we communicated their interest to Blackstone. But still given the rents, the risk associated with co-tenancies in (inaudible), although there is not higher probability those risks are going to manifest themselves into occurrence, we just were not comfortable with the amount of management time, or the consequences if something went wrong by \u2013 by continuing to hold the assets.","Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks. My other question just on core, I mean, you\u2019re seeing kind of great results in terms of occupancy, and same-store NOI, the rent growth on new leases has been kind of stubborn and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any potential for movement there, obviously they seem to be dragged down by some of the older vacancies, but given your leasing velocity in the commentary, do you think that we could see that turning positive over the next several quarters?","Martin Stein","We definitely think that\u2019s possible. As you indicate, we have \u2013 we aren\u2019t yet seeing the levels we want to see, but \u2013 but we\u2019re really talking about your pricing power and there\u2019s no question that \u2013 that power is improving that the trend is in the right direction and we have had five consecutive quarters of positive rent growth, and 80% of the transactions this \u2013 this past quarter were positive rent growth.","So, what\u2019s still holding us back a little bit would be as with anybody, some large deals they always \u2013 they always move the needle. For example, we had to put in a new we had to renew medical user at Martin Downs 40,000 square feet and in order to get that property sold as we look a hit there and we\u2019ve got \u2013 that we\u2019ve got some significant negative spreads on leasing activity in Arizona.","But, rent growth is all about leverage and we are hearing from across the country the return on leverage, multiple tenants competing for spaces. You can see the demand for the shopping centers, more and more, the properties are getting to 95% level where we do have pricing power. And we\u2019re starting to exercise lot termination rights that\u2019s allowing us put in better tenants, strategic move outs, and that also can give us better options in the future. So, we aren\u2019t there yet, but I do think the trend is heading more (inaudible).","Paul Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks.","Martin Stein","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Now, let\u2019s go to JP Morgan, Michael Mueller.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi. First question, it seems like you\u2019re gaining good traction on Gradn Ridge leasing further developments, but when you\u2019re looking at new starts today what are you underwriting for a period to ultimately stabilize the project, and how does that compared to which you\u2019re underwriting for the downturn?","Martin Stein","Again, it depends on the property on the ones where we have 10,000, 14,000 and 15,000 square feet, we\u2019re obviously going to underwrite it a little bit to happen faster than if we have more square footage. But in all cases, we\u2019re looking to put the amount of shop space in there that would allow us to lease that up, and get to 95% within no more than two years from the first anchor opening.","Bruce Johnson","And we\u2019d like to see good visibility, and a good probability of making that within a year.","Martin Stein","Yeah.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, great. And then the second question \u2013 oh, sorry go ahead.","Martin Stein","You go ahead.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Yeah, I was going to say in the second question the $200 million in acquisitions that you referenced the four properties, are they individual transactions, or is that a portfolio?","Martin Stein","Those are individual transactions.","Michael Mueller \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Let\u2019s go to Quentin Velleley with Citi.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Hi, good afternoon. Just speaking to Blackstone transaction, in terms of the (inaudible) and you sort of commented that they were lower gross assets, could you maybe quantify that a little bit more with a sort of \u2013 were you expecting sort of flat NOI or even negative NOI over the next five to seven years versus 2.5% to 3% growth in your portfolio, is that how you are thinking about it?","Martin Stein","I think looking at is flat NOI, may be some upside, but there is also after that \u2013 but as also I indicated there is some risk to that and once again Blackstone is a very astute buyer and from their perspective I\u2019m sure they feel like they made a good profit of the transaction, achieved our objectives and from our point of view it was a win-win transaction and, but I think the best way to look at that from our perspective is flat in (inaudible).","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Did you offer Blackstone substantially more assets, or where they easy on the assets that they\u2019ve got?","Martin Stein","This was the portfolio and there were actually thinking.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","Okay and then just lastly on dispositions given the ramp this year, how should we be thinking about 2013 and beyond, you sort of going to get back to a more normalized $100 million or $200 million of dispositions or given where capital markets are at the moment and given where risk is in some of the super market retailers should we expect to see this kind of volume of dispositions next year and beyond?","Martin Stein","I think we feel real good about what we accomplished and that was one of the reasons why we wanted to do an efficient transaction like this and large transaction and I think it\u2019s \u2013 in our view as you just said I think we feel comfortable with where we are and that we are going to be able get back to a more normalized rate of dispositions in $150 million to $200 million range.","Quentin Velleley \u2013 Citi","That\u2019s it. Thank you.","Operator","Let\u2019s go now to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, two quick questions. First of all the $200 million of upcoming acquisitions, could you let us know what cap rate that is, at what cap rates those transactions are being done at?","Martin Stein","Well, they are not finalized yet, but they are \u2013 I think you may have seen we slightly reduced our guidance on more acquisitions with these. So you can mention they are lower than what we\u2019ve done so far. And so let me just dwell in that a moment, the whole reason that we are doing this \u2013 the key objective is to maintain sustainable NOI growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, and the capital recycling including the acquisitions there are a key component of that.","We want to buy a kind of shopping centers that are highest quality because our experience is they generate the most growth. So what we\u2019re doing we price those as we look at total return from the asset, so we look at the initial return, plus the average compounded growth rate over the 10-year period.","So the only way we can get to those to forward lower cap rate deals would be if these properties are going to generate higher growth rate, so that\u2019s \u2013 and the properties that we\u2019re buying just then, and we are not done with them while we do control them all, but we are going through due diligence, you just don\u2019t know what may happen there. They are all A plus locations, one is the generational kind of product that just does not come on the market, but every 30 years or so, and one has redevelopment component, so those are the kind of ways that were getting to the growth and much of these is either through redevelopment contractual anchors.","Bruce Johnson","And our growth expectation is on the higher end of the 2.5% to 3.5% range sometimes above that especially the one property that has the redevelopment opportunity.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the small shop space like \u2013 could you just talk little bit about opportunities, (inaudible) consolidate small shop space for tenants kind of looking for more kind of 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of space whether you\u2019re kind of seeing a lot of that kind of demand.","Martin Stein","We always look for that. We have several examples of that this past quarter. We have three different centers where we had small shops \u2013 three small shops in each case where we consolidate them, some were just tenants that we had given a rent release too, and had termination rights, we triggered them. In three of those situations, we all put in larger pet stores line Petco. And we had a situation in Maryland where we had three small spaces, and we terminated a couple, relocated one to make room for Michael\u2019s. So, we look for that as often as we can do it, but I think more than just to be clear about that, more often than not, we\u2019re playing offence with that as it relates to merchandising, and as it relates to rent growth, not it relates to because we scared in this space.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Martin Stein","Thank you.","Operator","Let\u2019s go on to Cowen & Company, Jim Sullivan.","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen & Company","Hi. Good morning. First of all, may question for Brian, kind of a follow-up to the comment you just made about the 2.5% to 3.5% same-store NOI growth rate, when we look back at the prior cycle from the \u2013 I think 2005 to 2007 or so, the same property NOI growth rate was averaging pretty close to 3.5%, and I know every cycle is different, and it maybe that the uncertainties today are causing the people to be a little more conservative, but given how your occupancy is ramping, and you\u2019ve mentioned that I think in your prepared comments pricing flexibility, are you pretty optimistic that we\u2019re going to have a period here where we should see multiyear same property NOI growth in excess of 3%?","Brian Smith","Yes, yes. We \u2013 for the reason we talked about, I mean occupancy can drive right now. We do have contractual rent steps that have helped us throughout the period, good times and bad. And then we are seeing the pricing power for the rent growth so that plus we\u2019ve significantly upgraded the quality of the portfolio. We\u2019ll continue to do that. I think we have better retailers. We\u2019re going to be able to drive sales better. We got more productive grocers so, but I think, yes.","Martin Stein","I think we\u2019ve given a range of 2.5 to 3.5, but I think the expectation of being on the upper hand of that as long as the economy holds together is realistic.","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. And second question, obviously Supervalu has been in the news recently and there\u2019s always one or other supermarket chain that seems to be losing market share and suffering and \u2013 and I\u2019m just curious given what we\u2019ve been through and obviously you guys maintained a very substantial development pipeline for many years when \u2013 when the cycle was strong. I just wonder as you think through formats and as formats change and the industry buffer grocers as well is total center size, what can we expect or should we expect going forward in terms of your appetite for either the larger supermarket formats or the larger format centers altogether? I\u2019m talking about in terms of what do you want to commit to in terms of your development pipeline?","Martin Stein","I think when we started this quarter is indicative of an infill grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping center in Duke \u2013 University of Duke Medical Center and a larger format grocery-anchored, multi-anchored center in one of the better areas of Seattle.","Bruce Johnson","Yeah. Jim, we want to make sure that where we can, we want to focus on \u2013 on the grocery-anchored shopping centers. Now it so happens, that would typically be a neighborhood center and we wanted to do in infill locations or those areas with strong infill characteristics. But if you look at this acquirer, the centers in Seattle, that one is a community center, but it does have the leading grocery store up there in Safeway and it is such a high barrier to market, the last shopping center was built in that area was 20 years ago. It\u2019s a 100% lease now. This will take you years and years, so we\u2019re really comfortable to develop a larger center in that kind of space, but the focus is on grocery anchor centers.","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen & Company","And, in general if you\u2019re \u2013 if the focus is infill presumably it\u2019s difficult to find these sites, I know you have to work on them for a long time and getting approvals can take a long time, and as you think about what kind of level of development starts you can ramp up to as the market strengthens, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re still thinking it\u2019s going to be well below what it was in the peak previously?","Bruce Johnson","Yes. Because, we were $500 million a year, we\u2019re staff for that, we were capable of doing that, but you know that\u2019s a very difficult problem or program to manage. We plan to be $150 million to $200 million a year to the extent we see opportunities greater than that, then we\u2019re just going to start picking, which ones we like the best of those, and we do not plan to grow larger net, but we think, we\u2019re there now, and the outlook for it starts down the road, it\u2019s pretty promising.","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. Then final question from me also on development, the level of quarterly development cost being capitalized is running about $2.5 million, I\u2019m assuming we should assume that the path to the run rate that you will be at if you may maintain this level of development?","Bruce Johnson","That\u2019s correct.","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay, thanks.","Operator","A question now from Samit Parikh, International Strategy & Investment Group.","Samit Parikh \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","Hey. Good morning. Wanted to see personally so if you could help me get to your guidance range with 3Q, I know that the cap to insurance will go down call it $0.04 to $0.05 of FFO sequentially, and then there is the Blackstone sale as well, but you know having difficulty getting from call it 69 core to sort of the mid-to-high point of your 55 to 59 range next quarter.","Martin Stein","I think it probably is related to disposition activity, primarily I think that that always going to be the difference when analysts can\u2019t get to our numbers, our assumptions versus whatever you have been assuming.","Samit Parikh \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","Okay.","Bruce Johnson","Yeah, just really quickly because it\u2019s have to \u2013 it is buried in the other income line. It was a little bit larger this year than it has been in typical years on a combination basis. It was north of $4 million, when I say combination; I mean what\u2019s coming through equity income, pickup as well as on the consolidated income statement. So, a little bit larger than normal.","Samit Parikh \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess also could you comment maybe on Safeway and their plans on developing their own shopping centers. It seems like clearly they are developing in markets that you compete. How much of a sort of competitor are they for you guys to sort of gain these sites that going to develop on?","Martin Stein","Well, we know that the Safeway Development Team well. We like them. We respect them. In fact, a former employee or ours is part of that team. They are not new to development and we\u2019ve been competing with them for some time probably 10 years ago, we competed with them on our Folsom and Tracy projects and we prevailed on those. They do obviously have a new focus and emphasis on it, but the reality is we don\u2019t run into them very much and I think it\u2019s just because we\u2019re different.","We\u2019re focused on new round of dominant centers, anchored by however is the best grocer in the given market and Safeway focuses on Safeway Stores. So, that means where they have a store presence, they may not be very active. And from what we have seen in the market is that most of what they are doing and it just may not be (inaudible) access to whole pipeline, but most of our capital going to redevelopments or single tenant buildings or Safeway store maybe a fuel center, and so we don\u2019t run it might the only two projects that I know of that we have competed with them recently with the Grand Ridge project in Seattle where they are going to be an anchor of it, and then we both went after the project in San Jose, and neither one of us got it.","So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like we just don\u2019t run into them that much we could, and when that happens sellers make their own decisions as to what it is that they are looking for. I think personal relationships don\u2019t matter solving seller\u2019s problems or matters and then in the case of master planned community like Grand Ridge, I think the seller felt that having multiple relationships with different kinds of retailers was advanced in terms of creating an amenity for that community.","Samit Parikh \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","Okay. That\u2019s all. Thank you.","Operator","RBC Capital Markets, Rich Moore please go ahead.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, guys. The two new development projects and once I guess you are looking at going forward. Are those primarily on land that you are identifying as new parcels of land that you want develop or do you have any legacy land in your portfolio that may also make its way to the development start status?","Bruce Johnson","Well. We certainly have legacy lands that we want to move into development, and I think we have about $60 million worth of that land with cost to date in land like that we plan to develop, but in terms of the ones that, that we are talking about this year or next year the vast majority of those would be new properties, in fact for 2012 they are all, they are all new except for the South Bay Village.","Martin Stein","Last year, we started the project in Petaluma, Southern Sonoma County, which was on land held, and we\u2019re actively working on several other sites.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, fine, good. Thank you, guys. And then on the \u2013 on the Blackstone transaction, why the preferred position I mean what\u2019s the rationale behind hanging onto that?","Martin Stein","Well, that was a transaction \u2013 that was a structure of the \u2013 they\u2019ve all forgotten the \u2013 if you may or may not be real estate, using other transactions, where they bought properties and we negotiated that down to a short period of time of 12 to 18 months, and higher returns.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and so they, yeah I was aware of it, I think it happened \u2013 and so they, just basically insist on the strategy like that?","Martin Stein","I wouldn\u2019t go there, but that was part of \u2013 that was part of their offer.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s it. Thank you.","Martin Stein","And that\u2019s it \u2013 (inaudible) that\u2019s the question where we ended up.","Rich Moore \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, I got it, thanks very much.","Martin Stein","Thank you.","Operator","Let\u2019s move on to Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thanks. You acquired a small CVS property this quarter, I know it\u2019s not a lot of money, but where is the strategy behind it?","Martin Stein","Yes Cedrik that was one that was brought to us by a joint venture partner we\u2019ve done multiple developments with, and it was just \u2013 frankly just a no greater opportunity to get development returns with zero risk. I mean, it\u2019s tight this quarter, it\u2019s ground zero, in terms of Washington DC real estate, and that was the situation where the partner identified a building that because of very quick damage had been emptied out, three story office building, and we went ahead and bought that, we had the grocer take the center, I\u2019m sorry, the grocer take the center as is, complete bondable lease, we don\u2019t put nickel into it. We get a development return, we literally can do anything and we\u2019ve got 9% return project with great credit.","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay so there is nothing else what we done there over time it\u2019s a simple long term lease with quality credit tenant.","Martin Stein","Quality credit tenant like I said total bondable lease, we are not responsible for anything. So we have no operating dollars going forth, we have no construction dollars going forth, and really it\u2019s just the \u2013 the ancillary benefit to that is you get your name in that market as continuing to be active in development or redevelopment opportunities of that magnitude and nature.","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay and then what is the current gap between your lease space and the physically occupied space in your portfolio?","Martin Stein","Oh, 240 basis points, total which is that 230 pre-lease, and 24 slow pay","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay","Martin Stein","This isn\u2019t much different than what\u2019s it\u2019s been for a while now","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay I mean you\u2019ve been anticipating I guess the shrinking of that GAAP when you think you go back to more normalized 100, 150 basis points?","Martin Stein","Well I think the risk is so high as we continue to keep doing this volume on leasing. I mean this is a huge quarter of new leasing for us. So that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping that line up there, the pre-leasing line, and that will have to start to fall as we get, as there is less space to lease, if you look at the effective rent paying occupancy, all that preleasing has been translating into rent paying occupancy it\u2019s just continue to do lot of leasing.","Cedrik Lachance \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay thank you.","Martin Stein","Thank you Cedrik.","Operator","(Operator Instructions))Moving on let\u2019s go to Deutsche Bank, Vincent Chao.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, everyone. Just going beyond the Blackstone transaction, just I wonder if you could provide some commentary about the general interest in B Class or secondary market properties today?","Martin Stein","Sure. I think what\u2019s happened probably this quarter versus last quarter or the quarter before is with all the uncertainty out there what\u2019s happening at the end of the year that buyers are less, I mean are more averse and they are not going to go out on the \u2013 their risk spectrum without getting compensated with yield, but I think what you are seeing is that buyers will pay up for high quality properties that have strong grocers that are generating strong sales, but you start to lose any of those things, then the pricing falls out pretty fast.","Bruce Johnson","And leverage can also be an impediment to price.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. This \u2013 but you are not seeing any sort of improvement in the secondary markets, which is something we heard on some other calls.","Bruce Johnson","Well, there is improvement in leasing markets, but in terms of specific to dispositions and acquisitions of the properties or in second tier markets, I think if anything has softened...","Martin Stein","There is a modest because of the huge amount of demand for core institutional quality real estate, there is a modest expansion of the definition of core, but beyond that it\u2019s people are interested in, there is a lot of buyers for core and Brian indicated a lot of buyers for value-add, but the commodity secondary to tertiary markets, it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s not a (inaudible).","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And just going back to the acquisitions quickly, on the cap rates, they\u2019ve been coming \u2013 in terms of your guidance, they have been coming down over the last couple of quarters and I think \u2013 I think you\u2019ve commented earlier that to pay that huge mix season of additional growth in those properties and I\u2019m just wondering you know at this point is \u2013 you\u2019re changing growth assumptions, is that coming more from your expectations of market rent or are you looking more and more at sort of very under market leases, properties and or lease up type of properties?","Martin Stein","It\u2019s not just was just structure of each individual asset that as I mentioned one of the properties we\u2019re looking at has redevelopment component, we would be adding some GLA, and other properties you have significant contractual rent steps, very little of it, we focus on (inaudible) what is contractual and what is speculative, and the vast majority would be contractual, and you know there is a another A quality property that\u2019s out there, it is an A plus trophy, everybody wants it, but it did not have this kind of growth profile that we\u2019re looking for so, in that case we walk away. So, we\u2019re not changing our underwriting assumptions at all.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And, I mean is that pooled in, I mean I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a shrinking pool, so at some point I mean do you stop the acquiring?","Martin Stein","If we can\u2019t meet our total return hurdles and especially as I think as Brian indicated, number one focus is, if we can get, we\u2019ve said a range of 2.5% to 3.5%, but if we can take with the incremental help, the meaningful margin of what we\u2019re buying and what we\u2019re recycling out of, that we can get that sustainable NOI growth rate to 2.5% to 3.5% range, that\u2019s our primary area \u2013 primary focus there, so if we can\u2019t find it, we won\u2019t.","Lisa Palmer","And, I will just add as Brian mentioned earlier, capital recycling is really a key part of our strategy, an important part to be sure that we can sustain that 2.5% to 3.5% same property NOI growth, but we monitor very closely our ability to invest those proceeds and we tried to be certain that our dispositions don\u2019t get way ahead of our acquisitions. This year is unique, but it\u2019s clearly we are contemplating this portfolio sale if we go back to the guidance that we provided back in December, and so we are well aware that\u2019s how we did the term loan, so we had the flexibility to have debt to repay and we had to use for the proceeds. So it\u2019s something that we watch very closely.","Martin Stein","One of the assets we are looking at is a fantastic center, grocery center as it is, but there is some small space kind of a mini mall area, and we would look to convert that into an anchor, which would be accretive, and then just some adjacent land right next to it, so there\u2019s many ways to get to that growth profile.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay thank you.","Martin Stein","Thank you.","Operator","Next question from Tom Lesnick with Robert W Baird.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W Baird","Good afternoon. I am standing in for Paula Poskon. What line items in operating expenses drove such a huge sequential improvement in the operating margin, are those true savings, or just timing related that might reverse in the second half.","Martin Stein","I would say to you from a trend standpoint, we typically see a reduction expenses in our second quarter just to give last year, you saw from the first quarter primarily in our operating expenses, cost related to winter\u2019s decline, we start paying and turn up to our true real estate taxes that we\u2019re paying and so those for the most part drive those increments in the second quarter..","Bruce Johnson","And occupancy \u2013 the increased occupancy clearly helps that as well......","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W Baird","Okay, and then relatively what trends are you seeing in real estate property taxes, are you seeing this coming down?","Bruce Johnson","It\u2019s continued to come down, I\u2019d say at this point, we would expect to see that to moderate, I don\u2019t think you continue to see the \u2013 the declines that we saw through last year and what we\u2019ve seen since the first quarter, so I think that the second quarter would be relatively typical what we see in the future with exception of if we start to significantly ramping up acquisitions, we\u2019ve get those adjustments for values. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see significant declines from here at all now.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W Baird","All right and then likewise what drove the G&A savings, this quarter?","Bruce Johnson","When you say G&A savings this quarter versus the prior year or?","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W Baird","Sequentially.","Bruce Johnson","Our net G&A for the quarter, there was reported 14.4, its down from 14.6, I would tell you that in general...","Martin Stein","Yeah and that was pretty flat quarter over quarter.","Bruce Johnson","Yeah.","Martin Stein","Some slightly higher capitalization as we increased our development activity, but \u2013 but not what I call significant maybe, it\u2019s a 200,000 order impact quarter-over-quarter.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W Baird","Okay. And then separately, how much do you think land prices and construction costs will rise and say in the next couple of years?","Martin Stein","Construction pricing has been fairly flat.)We\u2019re just looking at a week or so ago and probably over the last three years we\u2019ve seen a total increase of maybe 10% to 15%. It\u2019s not in labor. It\u2019s all depends on which commodity prices, a few years back it was oil, it was cement and now it\u2019s metals, so I don\u2019t see anything right now that\u2019s going to drive certainly the labor component of it, land prices in total development program across the country. For other people it starts dramatically ramping up I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see it there. Prices are high for, have held steady well located infill properties, but if it\u2019s anything other than that, frankly we are not interested in.","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Robert W Baird","All right. Great Tom. Thank you.","Operator","Moving onto Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, team. Really fast one I pulled out the, the same store NOI groups and for the first and second quarter is in the pool dropped about 8 million. Is that because Blackstone was in the same store poll and now it\u2019s not?","Martin Stein","That\u2019s correct.","Bruce Johnson","Correct.","Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And how much just the change of mix contributed to the increase in your same-store guidance. I just kind of took a, an envelope. Sorry?","Martin Stein","Absolutely none.","Bruce Johnson","Down in the first six months that our expectation is we are more comfortable and probably have some modest positive impact on a go forward basis.","Martin Stein","Year-to-date it was literally it was neutral, and that said from a guidance perspective that that portfolio sale gave us more comfort of increasing lower end of our guidance by more than increase our upper-end. There is just a little bit wider range of outcomes from the portfolio sale, from the properties that were in the portfolio.","Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So what you sold to Blackstone on a year-to-date basis have been running at about 3.5% NOI growth rate?","Martin Stein","That\u2019s correct. We increased occupancy.","Bruce Johnson","87% to 90% within the last 18 months.","Martin Stein","Right.","Bruce Johnson","And some of that has occurred recently, so a lot of that is baked into the numbers.","Andrew Rosivach \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","Martin Stein","Thank you Andrew.","Operator","And a question next Citi, from Quentin Velleley. Please go ahead again.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Yes. Michael Bilerman speaking. You think back to over the years you\u2019ve always been a pretty active capital recycler and have been pretty disciplined at calling out the bottom tier of the portfolio and to try to keep on enhancing the rest. And I\u2019m curious with the amount that you sold this year if you take your, let\u2019s call $4.7 billion of wholly-owned assets, how much more it sort of fits into this eight cap rate range, in terms of quality, in terms of something that you want to get rid off?","Martin Stein","I don\u2019t want to get specific in that regard, but what I will say is as a result of the sales that have occurred this year and that are pending, we intend to move back to the \u2013 what I call moderate levels of annual recycling of $150 million to $200 million a year. Another way of looking at that is that over 95% of our properties and now located in core markets. So, I think we\u2019ve made significant progress, but we\u2019re going to continue to be a capital recycler, Brian talked about the issues related to Supervalu and there was going to be another Supervalu down the road and for the most part, we want to own good real estate, we are seeing some bad news as good news, but I think that \u2013 I think the best way to put that within context is you can expect and we\u2019re expecting return not to say that we might not be opportunistic but $150 million to $200 million of annual recycling a year.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Well, I guess how would you satisfy the portfolio if you are buying core assets today in the low fives and you\u2019re selling these weaker assets in the eights? You\u2019re talking 250 basis points to 300 basis points spread in value, which is pretty substantial, so if you were to take your portfolio, where would you buck it in terms of value today and how much is in that five category, how much is squarely middle of the fairway, 61\/2%, 7% and how what percentages is sort of in that A?","Bruce Johnson","That\u2019s really, you\u2019re basically asking us to tell what we believe we believe our cap rate to be, I mean, I\u2019ll defer to Brian for in terms of the percentages that we believe are As but I think as a whole you would say that our A properties would be in the 5.5% to 6% cap rate range, our B properties would be more in this cost 6.5% to 7.5% and then \u2013 that seems to be 7.5% plus. And for a percentage stand point.","Martin Stein","I mean to 60 to two third percent \u2013 two-thirds in the AA plus category and the vast majority of the balance are going to be in solid B category.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","And then just last question, comes from the portfolios you sold to Blackstone when you go back to the historical cost of those assets \u2013 those assets were developed for about $413 million and obviously a big chunk of the cost is in the lifestyle centers in Dallas between shops higher end at 100 and custom target 60. So, from $413 a current yield about the stock or cost of it six and a quarter for the entire portfolio that you sold. And Hap I think in the press release you talked about a $20 million net impairment and how should we think about sort of this gross, where there\u2019s a $90 million drop from what you\u2019ve built or pop these assets for to what selling them for today?","Martin Stein","You said it. I mean we think in \u2013 the current values are what current values are \u2013 and we will make decisions where do we go from here and where we go from here is maximizing our growth and our operating income.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","With no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the presentation back over to Hap Stein for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin Stein","We appreciate your time, and we wish \u2013 we hope you have a great rest of the week, and great rest of the summer. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, once again we\u2019ll conclude our presentation for today. Thank you so much for joining us.

On today's call, you will hear from our Chairman and CEO, Hap Stein; our President and COO, Brian Smith; our Chief Financial Officer, Lisa Palmer; and Senior Vice President and Treasurer, Chris Leavitt.","Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Through the second quarter, Regency's team continued to take advantage of robust tenant demand and favorable conditions in the capital and sales markets to execute on all aspects of our strategy and make meaningful progress towards our key objectives.","Starting with our high-quality portfolio, the 5% NOI growth achieved in the first half of the year should result in annual growth in excess of 3.5%. With respect to our development program, our roster of high-quality in-process developments are approaching 90% leased in creating substantial value on our $240 million investment, and I continue to be excited about the prospects of our pipeline for new developments. I'm also encouraged by the growing pipeline for value-added redevelopments, expansions and renovations. The team has currently identified future projects that represent over $100 million of opportunities. And just as critical, we are cost-effectively strengthening what is already a rock-solid balance sheet while funding our new investments through our ATM and property sales.","We're gratified by these advances, but in order to carry this positive momentum through the rest of the year and beyond, our management team will continue to focus on the key drivers for growing net asset value for our shareholders: intense leasing and asset management, together with the addition of high-quality shopping centers and the disposition of those that have been prioritized for sale, which will be critical to sustaining long-term growth in NOI of 2.5% or more; creating value and great shopping centers through developments and redevelopments; astutely and opportunistically preserving and enhancing an already strong balance sheet; and a capital markets environment that, as we experienced during the last 60 days, can quickly become volatile and more expensive; and utilizing Regency's special culture to maintain the team's high level of engagement and focus.","Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap, and good morning to some of you, good afternoon to most of you. Core FFO per share for the second quarter was $0.67. This is $0.03 ahead of the high end of guidance, primarily as a result of higher net operating income. Year-to-date same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 5.1%, with a majority of this outperformance coming from base rental income. The balance of our growth was due to the timing of prior year recoveries, percentage rent and other income.","With respect to capital markets activity, during the quarter, we raised just over $36 million through our ATM at a weighted average share price of nearly $55. As Hap stated, this, together with dispositions, is consistent with our strategy to cost-effectively fund investments while improving our already healthy balance sheet metrics towards our long-term targets. And to that end, we raised guidance for dispositions -- the high end of guidance for dispositions by $50 million due to the heightened visibility of selling 2 additional centers.","Hap also mentioned the recent fluctuations in the capital markets. I think it's worth reminding everyone that more than half of the $500 million of unsecured debt maturing in 2014 and 2015 has been locked at 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively. This represents 10-year treasury rates, plus swap spreads. We continue to monitor future commitments in order to maintain significant uncommitted capacity on our $800 million line, which, as of today, has an outstanding balance of only $5 million.","Looking ahead, I'd like to walk through the revisions to our full year guidance for 2013. As a result of the second quarter outperformance, we now expect same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. The impact of base rental income is expected to moderate as we face higher comps from the strong occupancy gains we experienced over the second half of 2012. This results in an increase of $0.04 at the midpoint of the range for core FFO per share","Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon. Our focused leasing efforts, the success of our redevelopment and ground-up developments and our portfolio enhancement strategies produced yet another quarter of strong results. The operating portfolio made a full recovery from its seasonal first quarter occupancy dip and closed the second quarter at 94.6% leased. The biggest improvement came in spaces less than 10,000 square feet, which gained 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter and now stand at 88.5% leased. Also, we are experiencing broader leasing demand. Prospective retailers and restaurants are being less picky about the spaces they will lease and are now more focused simply on securing a space. Increasingly, national tenants are seeking to lock in early renewals at today's rents, and negotiating leverage is clearly improving for landlords. For example, it's now typical to get firm outside rent commencement dates, something that was common before the downturn, but not since. This is drastically improving our downtime, which is 45% shorter today than at the end of the first quarter of 2011. In fact, the average downtime is now a mere 3 months for spaces vacant for less than a year.","The shift in pricing power also affords us the leverage to drive rents as evidenced by rent growth of 15% on new leases. As a matter of fact, this is the ninth consecutive quarter of positive rent growth. And just as notable, these consistent occupancy gains and strong rent growth figures have led us to NOI growth in excess of 3% for the sixth quarter in a row.","Looking forward, we should continue to deliver same-property NOI growth on a long-term basis in excess of 2.5%, supported by embedded growth from a meaningful amount of contractual rent increases, continued interest from retailers and restaurants looking to expand, particularly in the better shopping centers, the leverage gained as we achieve and even surpass our objective of 95% rent-paying occupancy and the addition of new retail supply remaining at a rate that is significantly below historic levels.","I'm also pleased to announce that our value-added redevelopment program continues to produce exceptional results. By removing underperforming operators and replacing them with proven high-quality retailers, not only have we been able to generate high rents, more traffic and better merchandising, but we've also substantially upgraded the growth potential of our income stream. For example, at Greenway Town Center, a new redevelopment start this quarter in Portland, Oregon, we terminated a lease with an underperforming regional grocery store and replaced it with Whole Foods at nearly 2x the rent. This game-changing new anchor, along with planned upgrades of the center's facade, parking lot, landscaping and other common area features, will create substantial value.","Speaking of Whole Foods, their operating success and plans for expansion are no secret to anyone. With very strong average store sales, healthy margins and a top-notch shopping experience, Whole Foods is an ideal anchor for shopping centers in our target demographic to attract the best-in-class secondary anchors, shop retailers and restaurants. To that end, we are excited to be working closely with Whole Foods on a dozen exceptional development and redevelopment opportunities that are in our pipeline.","Moving to ground-up developments, we started 2 projects during the second quarter and announced a third just last week. The first, Shops On Main, was covered in detail on our prior call. Construction is progressing nicely, and the project is converting $15 million of land into what will be a quality shopping center that is expected to generate 12% incremental return on newly invested capital. The second, Juanita Tate Marketplace, is located in a high-barrier, in-fill market near downturn Los Angeles, with approximately 450,000 people living within a 3-mile radius. It will be anchored by a leading Hispanic grocer called Northgate Market and CVS. We are projecting a return of 9.2% on invested capital.","After the close of the quarter, we purchased 23 acres of land in Miami, Florida, on which we will develop a 320,000-square-foot center that will be anchored by Target, Publix, Ross and T.J. Maxx. Before even breaking ground, the center is nearly 90% leased and committed, with interest for every space. Land is scarce in Miami, and infill development is the only kind of development. This center is no exception. This is a dense trade area, with more than 180,000 people living within 3 miles. It also benefits from a daytime population of 250,000, due in part to its location near the second largest university in Florida. Perhaps more importantly, this will be Regency's first ground-up development in Miami. This gives us a foothold from which we should be able to expand our development presence in this highly desirable market.","Turning to acquisitions, the environment remains very competitive for a limited supply of A-quality product on the market. And the recent increase in interest rates has not moved cap rates for institutional quality centers in primary markets. Those buyers use low leverage and are challenged to find satisfactory places to deploy their huge amounts of capital. This makes our recent purchase of Preston Oaks even more rewarding. Preston Oaks is located in the prestigious Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, with average household incomes in excess of $140,000. The center is anchored by H.E.B. Central Market and in its first year-generated sales of nearly $900 per square foot and also features national retailers, including Gap, Pier 1 Imports and White House Black Market. With a growth profile of 3% annually, this is a great addition to our portfolio. We look forward to adding more centers like Preston Oaks that meet Regency's strategic NOI growth and total return guidelines.","Because the buyers of B properties, especially in secondary markets, are more opportunistic and rely more heavily on leverage, there could be a backup in cap rates for B centers. However, we haven't seen it yet. To that end, we sold 5 properties this quarter for combined net proceeds of nearly $90 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.7%. And as Lisa discussed, we raised guidance to a new range of $250 million to $300 million due to recent leasing progress on 2 centers that have been targeted for sale.","In closing, with what we've accomplished over the past 4 quarters, we've raised the bar. Regency's formula for growing NAV is the right one, and the team is highly engaged and motivated to help build on our positive momentum during the second half of the year.","Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Lisa. To wrap it up, I continue to be gratified by the dedicated effort that our team brings to the table each and every day to execute our strategy. I really like how Regency is poised to continue to grow shareholder value.","We thank you for your time, and we welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have our first question from Christy McElroy from UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Lisa, just wanted to ask a couple of questions on expenses. It seemed like your same-store operating expenses in Q2 saw a pretty big jump. Just wondering what the biggest contributors were to that rise and sort of what you're expecting for the balance of the year. And then on recoveries, you talked about timing of recoveries contributing to the quarter. I'm wondering if you could expand on that a bit.","Lisa Palmer","Sure. And I'll let Brian add some color if he'd like. But we did -- there were some late snowstorms. I think we had a couple of April snowstorms in a few regions of the country. That contributed to the higher expenses spike sequentially and also year-over-year.","Brian M. Smith","Yes. In terms of the operating expenses, they are really only about 2% higher on controllable expenses. What we had was snow, as Lisa was talking about, last year, that was late in the year. And what we used to do is time our building improvements, painting, parking lot resurfacing and things like that. We do that when there's no snow. So usually, those happen later in the year. And last year, just because of the weather, they happened earlier. So that will all level out for the end of the year. And then the other expenses, there were some property taxes that were higher, and -- but the control of expenses are only 2%.","Lisa Palmer","And then with regards to timing, we finished our reconciliations earlier this year. So we completed all of our prior year recs in the second -- by the end of the second quarter. Last year, that was in the third quarter. And it's contributing to current year income approximately $0.02. However, we'll see that reverse because we're going to be up against the higher comp in the third quarter.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just what was physical occupancy at the end of Q2?","Lisa Palmer","You mean physical or you mean rent?","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","For commenced occupancy as opposed to the leased rate. What was the commenced occupancy rate of the portfolio?","Brian M. Smith","92.9%.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","92.9%?","Brian M. Smith","It's 92.9%. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm not sure if you agree with the approach, but if I look at the sequential change in the dollar rents you're signing on new and renewal leases, they haven't really moved a great deal over the past year. Does that imply that market rents maybe snapped back after 2008 and 2009 but ultimately have kind of flattened back out in the last year?","Brian M. Smith","Well, Jeff, I'm not sure I do agree with that. I know at least on our shop space rents, those rents increased for 8 -- I mean, it was 8 straight quarters before this quarter taking a dip down. That's all shop spaces, excluding ground leases. Sometimes ground lease has thrown [ph] a little bit of noise. But they are now at levels that -- well, last quarter, they were the highest they had ever been, and this quarter, they backed down a little bit. I think they fell about 11%. But they're still, I think, where they were about second quarter 2008. Now the anchors, that definitely distorts things because we had a 34% drop in the average rents signed this quarter with anchors. And that's because 12 of them were at single-digit rents, and all but 2 of those were renewals with fixed increases from leases signed long ago. For example, we had a DBS [ph] with $1.85. And so I think the average anchors signed this quarter was $10.26, but we signed 3 or 4 anchor leases either in the quarter or subsequent to it that average about $20 a foot. So I just think the average rents, especially on the anchors, distorts the picture a bit.","Martin E. Stein","And that obviously is not a same space reported number.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Understood. And just to clarify, I wasn't necessarily looking at spreads per se, it's just that 12 months ago, you guys were doing leases -- new leases at $22.50 a foot, and today, they are around $23.50. But they haven't moved tremendously. But maybe as a follow-up, it looks like TI dollars on small shop tenants has been rising across almost all the REITs out there. Is that a function of maybe companies cutting deeper into tougher-to-lease space as we mature in the cycle or just really kind of a coincidence because of tenant mix?","Brian M. Smith","Jeff, you look at the supplemental, for sure, it shows 3 quarters in a row of increasing rents. And -- but the reality is, if you go back to 4 quarters ago, that was the lowest amount of TI that we had given. It was the bottom literally of any amount that we have on record for how much we've given. So yes, it's been 3 quarters increasing, but it's coming off a very low base. In fact, except for this quarter, the last 10 quarters have all been below our historic average. So this is the first quarter where it's ticked up just a little bit above the long-term average. And the other thing I would say about those TIs is we are giving it significantly less often than we have in the past. I think there's like 42% or something like that this quarter.","Lisa Palmer","And there was one transaction that was a bit of an anomaly, a very difficult to lease -- in California.","Brian M. Smith","Yes, we have a space that's only suitable for a daycare center. So as part of our redevelopment, we combined a couple of spaces to bring in another daycare operator, and that had very high TIs. We did a PetSmart lease. The PetSmart leases always require a lot of TIs for their electrical and plumbing. And then we had a Corner Bakery that took a lot. So we had fewer leases. We had a few that were higher, so it kind of distorts it. But overall, like I said...","Martin E. Stein","We're close to historical average.","Brian M. Smith","We're close to historical averages.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Isbee with Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","As you look at the 5% same-store growth that you generated in the second quarter, can you perhaps break it down a little bit between the occupancy? What exactly was driving that growth? Occupancy is up, but it wouldn't signify a 5% plus same-store growth combined with the 5% leasing spreads.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. Nate, as I mentioned on the call, there's a significant amount that is related to timing, so the timing of percentage rent and the timing of prior year recoveries and also timing of other income. And if you -- we do expect those to literally reverse, so not just normalize, but reverse for the second half of the year. And if you were to level that, we would be closer to the high 3% range.","Martin E. Stein","And a good portion of that comes from contractual.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. A good portion of that, call it 3.8%, is from base rental income, and we've been through that math with you. If you get 1.25% to 1.5% from contractual rent steps, then occupancy is driving, really, the rest of that with -- our rent growth has been kind of low single digits. So it's not contributing as much.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So when you look at the guidance increase for the full year, would you say most of that is driven by the outperformance in the first half? Or would you say that you've allowed for any, what I would call, core fundamental acceleration in the second half?","Lisa Palmer","It is driven by the outperformance in the first half. Basically to get -- with a range of 3.5% to 4% from where we are today, growth in the second half would be 2% to 3%. And I, again, would point you to the same formula. If we're getting 1.25% to 1.5% on contractual rent steps, the rest is going to become -- is going to be coming from occupancy, with a limited contribution to -- from rent growth. And yes. And the range is -- we're sitting at 94.6% leased, and our full -- our range for the year is down 30 bps to up 40 bps. And that also contributes to the range of same-property NOI growth.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Did I ask my follow-up yet? All right, I'll just jump in. So Brian, just following up on that, when you talk about tenants being less picky and being willing to trade down in terms of space, at what point would you say that's going to start translating to higher leasing leverage in terms of your rent growth?","Brian M. Smith","Well, I think our rent growth is already showing the leverage that we're looking for. We had 90% of our markets generating positive rent growth. And I think we've shown you before that in terms of the number of leases, it's about 3\/4 are positive and 2 years ago, it was 1\/4. So we've just got still some markets more than anything -- I'd say still Sacramento, Central Valley and Arizona are the ones that are causing the drag. But I think until those markets start improving a lot more than they have, we're still going to see a little bit of the drag. In terms of the spaces, I think we did what can -- if you look at our rent growth for spaces less than 12 months vacant and compare it to the old method of doing it, there's a pretty big difference. And I think what you see there is, there's about 10 properties that had negative rent growth and the average being down for 40 months, in some cases, as long as 80 months. So the fact is that we're starting to see those spaces turning over and leasing that haven't leased in years. So I don't know when that specifically translates into a higher number, but it's obviously moving in the right direction.","Lisa Palmer","And that actually contributes a little bit to the point that Jeff was getting to. So we believe some much more difficult to lease space, a little bit less desirable, so obviously, those rents are going to be lower than our average rents in our portfolio.","Operator","Next, from Jefferies, we have Tayo Okusanya.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","First question, the potential merger between Kroger and Harris Teeter, I mean, I know it's still kind of early in the process, but do you expect that to involve any consolidation and if that could potentially have any impact to your portfolio?","Brian M. Smith","I think the impact is going to be -- none of us really knows what's going to happen, but if you take Kroger at their word that they're going to let Harris Teeter operate the way they've been operating, I think it's a win for everybody. Harris Teeter has a great brand in the Carolinas, in particular, and the only problem is they have fairly low margins. And I think when -- if Kroger allows them to keep their brand, keep operating as Harris Teeter where they have a loyal following in the Carolinas and then they bring their purchasing power and more savvy systems -- operating systems, I think it's going to be really good for our centers, it's going to be good for Harris Teeter and for Kroger. Up in D.C., I think it's less clear what's going to happen, but I think that's where they view their engine -- their growth engine being. And I'd only be speculating if I said what I thought was going to happen there, but if they would go into the market being #4, Shoppers Food Warehouse is #3. You could see that there might be a potential for something to happen there. And if that were the case, I think that also benefits our portfolio.","Lisa Palmer","And I would add that Kroger has a pretty good track record of assimilating acquired companies.","Martin E. Stein","In our conversations with them, they are very excited about the Harris Teeter brand and their ability, as Brian indicated, to improve efficiencies without adversely impacting the brand. So I think it's a win-win. Also, in the Carolinas, we have one store where there's significant amount of overlap, and that store is a Kroger store that is a bigger size than the Harris Teeter across the street, plus had a gas pad which is important to Kroger. So we feel pretty good about what the impact is going to be to us both in general and on a specific basis.","William I. Acheson - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up call. Lisa, I mean, in this quarter, did we kind of see the same trend of just move-outs you were expecting basically not happening? Was that also part of the occupancy gain this quarter?","Lisa Palmer","Yes. And I think Brian would love to share actually how we did perform move-outs. So I'm going to let Brian answer that.","Brian M. Smith","If you look at our move-outs, they are about average for a typical quarter. But if you break it down a little bit more, I think you'll see some very positive underlying strength. 170,000 of those -- square feet of those move-outs were for anchor tenants who are temporarily -- have temporarily moved out while we do redevelopments or they've moved out entirely while we bring in a new one. For example, in Texas, we terminated the Randall's lease on our Woodway Center. We'll be bringing in Whole Foods. That's showing up as a move-out. So if you strip those out, we only have 230,000 square feet of move-outs, which is, by far, the lowest amount of move-outs we've ever registered in a quarter. And then if you focus just on the small shops, it was the second lowest amount of move-outs we've ever had for shop tenants. So overall, that average number doesn't tell the whole picture. I think the whole picture is really positive.","Lisa Palmer","And as I've answered on the last question, that is what is driving the outperformance for the half -- first half of the year, which has been causing the raise for the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the same-store discussion. I'm sorry to beat that one. But just want to tie the numbers. You talked about 1.25%, 1.5% coming from rent steps. I guess, about -- from what I understand from your comments, about 150 basis points from timing on recoveries. And then...","Lisa Palmer","Recoveries, percentage rent and other income, all of them together.","Brian M. Smith","About 120.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So it leaves us with about 200 basis points, which is likely -- primarily from occupancy. What's the increase in occupancy that's taken place? So not in the leased occupancy report but in the command store rent-paying occupancy, what's the increase that's taken place there over the last year?","Brian M. Smith","Bear with us one second, Cedrik. Okay. We're about 130 basis points of effective rent-paying occupancy growth.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so does that contribute to the whole 200 basis points? Or is there a little more that came from, say, redevelopment as well?","Lisa Palmer","Redevelopment was just a small contribution for the first half of the year. Same-property NOI growth without redevelopment is 5%. So most of it is just coming from -- the amount -- the contribution to same property growth from occupancy change really does depend on the mix and on the average rents. But call it 130 basis points, if you take kind of our -- if you take a midpoint of $25 kind of average rent, that does contribute to full 200 basis points.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in regards to the rent negotiating process right now, where are you able to push most? Is it on the base rent? Is it on your ability to reduce tenant inducements and CapEx? Or is it on the amount of reimbursements that you can charge your tenants?","Brian M. Smith","Cedrik, really, it's all those. We're obviously pushing rents, as you can see, from our new rent growth numbers. Where we still -- remember, we're renewing or re-leasing 2008 spaces now. So where we do have renewals that were above market, what we're seeing is we're getting lower growth -- rent growth, but we are getting much better steps going forward. We're also getting -- able to negotiate percentage rent better than we used to from the anchors at artificial growth breakpoints lower than would normally be the case. Concessions for the most part are just not even an issue. The only place where the tenants right now are really pushing back would be on control of the space. The anchors want to make sure that they protect their sales through exclusives and things like that. But other than that, pretty much, the negotiations have turned totally in our favor.","Martin E. Stein","Yes, the prior year recovery is an indication of higher reimbursements that we're achieving from the tenants.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Looking, I guess, at the guidance for Q3 FFO, it looks like it's expected to be, I think, it's $0.61 to $0.63. Can you reconcile the $0.67 and what causes the drop in Q2?","Lisa Palmer","Yes. Again, I'd start with the fact that we completed our reconciliations in the second quarter, and that's about $0.02. And then the rest is really timing of dispositions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Quentin Velleley from Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you just speak broadly on the development pipeline? If you include the Miami project, you're getting close to $300 million. Your starts are up to $125 million to about $200 million this year. How should we think about the level of development you are comfortable with? And where ultimately could the pipeline move to?","Brian M. Smith","Sure. With Fontainebleau, we're at $128 million of starts for developments and redevelopments, which is where the low end of the range is. We feel really good that this year, we've got -- we'll get up somewhere near the high end. We've got $49 million worth of high probability ground-up developments, which we rate, in part, high probability because we're confident they're going to happen. We control the land, we have anchor tenant leases signed, but you never know. Something, I suppose, could happen. And we've got another $13 million of high probability redevelopments. So that's about $190 million. And then we've got another development that we think we're going to get, which -- that's not as certain. So that would take us up to -- slightly above $200 million high end of the guidance range. I think going forward, you can expect that we would do somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million to $200 million of ground-up development, depending on the size of the projects. If we have a bunch of Grand Ridge Plazas or Fontainebleaus, that number is going to be large. Redevelopments and expansions, renovations, I would think that would be in the $50 million to $100 million range. So I think somewhere in the $150 million to $300 million range.","Martin E. Stein","With a good portion of that being redevelopments and expansions.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just going back to Jeff's question on the new leases into -- in the second quarter. The TI CapEx was up about $10, and it sounded like there was 1 lease that drove that increase. Can you give us a sense of what TIs would have been on the new leases if you excluded that 1 lease?","Brian M. Smith","There were actually about 4 leases that stand out, Quentin. I mentioned the daycare center. That was, I think, about $78 a foot. It was a big number. And then we had PetSmart leases. I mentioned that use -- whether it's PETCO, any of the pet supply guys, because they have fish tanks, they have a lot of electrical in there, they're going to have big TIs. And then we had Corner Bakery and a -- what was the other one? I think it was a salon, wasn't it? Yes. The salon. So I don't -- we could probably get back to you as to what the number would be. I don't have it.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. I mean, I guess it would be very much in line with historical averages.","Brian M. Smith","Yes. Because we're only slightly above the historical averages this quarter. I think it would probably take you right down to it, maybe slightly below.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question on the leasing activity sort of broadening out and seeing better activity across the board there. I mean, can you just share what the percentage of leases this quarter had roll-ups and how that compares to recent quarters?","Martin E. Stein","You mean increased rents?","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","Martin E. Stein","The percentage of it was like 75%.","Brian M. Smith","Well, yes. It was like -- in terms of positive rent growth, it was about 75%.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And how does that compare to sort of recent trends?","Brian M. Smith","On the long-term trend compared to -- starting 2 years ago, it's much better. It was about 25% of our leases had positive rent growth. Now it's about 75%. So quarter-to-quarter may bounce around a little bit, but I think it's slightly lower than it was last quarter. But, again, long-term trend, we're seeing more and more and more leases with positive rent growth.","Lisa Palmer","And, again, attributing some of that to some of the space that has been vacant for quite a long time.","Brian M. Smith","Actually, the 73% is wrong. It was 60% last quarter, 48% the quarter before. So over the last 3 quarters for the spaces vacant less than 12 months, it's been getting stronger.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question, just going back to the commentary about the cap rate environment. And you haven't seen it yet in the B assets in terms of cap rates going up but could -- reasonably could go up. Does that cause you to want to pull forward any other dispositions? I know you raised the guidance for some visibility on some deals. But any desire to pull forward some deals?","Martin E. Stein","We'll continue to be opportunistic and continue to look at our portfolio. And we've made significant progress on those assets that we prioritize for sale, and we're about to start that process right now. And, I guess, Brian indicated, there were 2 assets where we had meaningful leasing progress, one of which we replaced the anchor and we pulled those forward. So that's the kind of decisions that we'll make. I mean, the team had already targeted these for sale for a while, and we -- but they want -- we wanted to wait until we had resolved an anchor issue. And we did in the past quarter. And it looks like we're either under contract or about to go on a contract on 2 centers that we targeted for sale.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You guys are kind of leading the pack in terms of number of new developments you're doing, and usually, what we hear is -- from the others, from your competitors in the public world is that the rents just don't make sense at this point. What are you guys seeing, I guess, that is leading to -- it looks like a pretty good acceleration in development?","Brian M. Smith","I think -- we had, what? $150 million of ground-up starts last year, Rich. It's not meaningfully more. I just don't agree with that. I think what you've seen is, and we continue to see, is the place where it does pencil is in the better demographic areas where there's much more purchasing power, a combination of average household income and population density. That's where the retailers can generate the sales, and therefore, they're willing to pay the kind of rents that we need. So in terms of why I think we're getting more than our share, some of it is market demand, but like I said, it really is in those better areas. Some of it is financial strength because in those areas, you've got to -- you've got to have some real staying power. I think if you look at our Juanita Tate development, that thing has been -- we've been working on entitlements for 19 years. And Dublin, which is coming down the pike for next year, you're facing lawsuits, lots of money. I think one of the things is that we kept good people during the downturn because it takes years to get these projects through the pipeline to find them, to entitle them. I think some of it is just success breeds success. It gives you credibility with sellers, particularly joint venture partners when they can see how much you've done. We're working on, I mentioned, 12 Whole Foods developments or redevelopments. Yesterday, we were talking to a landowner in a great area who wants to do a development with Whole Foods, and he knows that we've done probably more than anybody. And then I think a lot of it is a skill set. Avon is a property that we're going to close on later this year and start in Chicago, and I think that one -- if you'd ask me about a year ago, I wouldn't have put any money on that we'd actually persevere in getting our entitlements. But the team did an unbelievable job on that one. And I think, finally, it's relationships. We've got a property that we're going to be starting next year in an area that is a true work, live, play environment, again, a Whole Foods development. And that one, there are relationships with the owners of that company and Regency that go way back. One of them is Hap's fraternity brother. So I think the combination of those things, really, is what's helping us succeed.","Martin E. Stein","And I will say, even though we are seeing a pickup in the amount of new developments occurring, it's still well below historic averages. So there's a limited amount of opportunity there. But we -- our focus is extremely sharpened. We, so to speak, have learned our lessons. We're developing those centers that makes sense for the long term, with great anchors in great locations, primarily in-fill or in planned unit developments when it's suburban. And secondly, I think -- and we've been talking about kind of $100 million to $200 million or in the $150 million range. The pickup that we're seeing is more on the development and redevelopment side. And hopefully, I think we've taken that from, say, $10 million to $15 million in renovations a year to hopefully will be in the $25 million to $50 million and maybe even more than that on a go-forward basis or on an annual start basis.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. Great Answer. Then on the acquisition side of things, is there any interest from your partners, your co-investment partners in selling their shares or in you approaching them to buy their shares?","Martin E. Stein","I think the opportunities there from our standpoint are pretty limited from what we understand. For the most part, our partners have -- other than the fund, which we -- which is under contract for sale, I think the opportunities there from Oregon and CalSTRS, and First Washington and CalPERS are pretty limited. You never know.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about -- if you've seen -- you guys have mentioned the strong retail demand, and it's reflected in your occupancy. Has that translated into your secondary assets or markets at all?","Brian M. Smith","Yes. One of the things that we are seeing this quarter, we mentioned a little bit on the call, is just how broad the demand is getting. I mean, some of our weaker markets like Michigan, some of our best leasing activity this quarter happened up there. We did about 12 -- I think we signed 8,000 square feet of leases in Fenton, our project in Fenton, and 4,000, I think, have been signed since then. Our State Street project up there, the inline space is 100% leased. In the housing-dependent markets, we've got, for the first time, about 6 properties that have hit 100% leased that struggled during the downturn. So I think we're seeing it in weaker spaces within the center. I'll just give you another example there. We have a BJ's up in Massachusetts. And they went out, and we found a replacement tenant to take about 2\/3 of the space, leaving about 30,000 square feet in the back. We actually got somebody to take that backspace. So there's lots of examples of improvement in housing-dependent markets. Weaker markets, Arizona is seeing a lot more activity. The rents are still soft, but you're seeing much more activity than we ever did before.","Martin E. Stein","Let me just remind you, we have 3 centers in Arizona. Now we sold one and down 2 in Michigan. So it's a very limited amount of our space and even becoming more so.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","But still, your occupancy growth that you've been reporting, is that still predominantly your better markets, better assets? Or has that actually, from a financial standpoint, shifted?","Brian M. Smith","That's what the majority of our space is, so yes, that's where it's all coming from.","Martin E. Stein","But it's across the board. And as Brian mentioned, we're seeing it in all markets.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And second question. I understand that class A, B+ assets haven't changed much in terms of cap rate. But given your, I guess, significant development or redevelopment pipeline, have you guys internally changed the way you view IRRs or, I guess, more specifically, exit cap rates? And have those changed to reflect in some way the change in treasury rates?","Martin E. Stein","We're still -- from a development standpoint, depending on where the development is located, where the market is, et cetera, we're looking for returns in the 7.5% to 8.5% range. And from an acquisition standpoint, we're looking for total returns. That's growth, plus going in return in excess of 8%, and at least having growth that's going to be in excess of 2.5% so that the properties we're buying is going to be accretive to our long-term NOI growth rate.","Lisa Palmer","And both of those scenarios that Hap described would have IRRs at or slightly above our weighted average cost of capital.","Martin E. Stein","Particularly developments.","Lisa Palmer","Yes, the developments would be much above, acquisitions at or slightly above.","Operator","Our last question comes from Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a quick question on the dispositions. I see Anthem Marketplace, you guys got pretty good price on that, 5 9. Is there some upside that you might be leaving on the table there? Or what's the disposition thesis, I guess, on that asset?","Brian M. Smith","I saw the press release that the buyer thinks there's upside. We wouldn't have sold it if we thought there was. We had an anchor tenant, The Grocer [ph]. The sales were weak, they were not trending right and we thought that was -- represents some significant risk for us. That particular property is, I think, at the outer reach of the market, if you will. And frankly, I think it's not really that well-positioned compared to some properties in the market. So beauty is in the eye of the beholder and, for us, it represented risk and no upside, but...","Martin E. Stein","We hope the buyer does well, like we always have, but we have no regrets about the sale. And as indicated on the 2 properties that we're now bringing to market, we waited until we were able to do a substantial amount of leasing before we sold. We're always making those evaluations. But look, we've sold a lot of property, and we hope every one of our buyers does extremely well with their investments.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And then following up on Juanita Tate. I think you guys mentioned it earlier, but can you talk a little bit about how that development sort of plays out in terms of the sweet spot of what you guys like to develop and own? And I think the household income number there is much lower than what you guys typically do. Is this just sort of a vestige of what you guys have been working on for the last 19 years like you mentioned? Or is this something that we could see more of in the future?","Martin E. Stein","Yes. I mean, the key thing there is when you look at the purchasing power there, I mean, what we shoot for is an excess of $200,000. That's average household income, plus population density. And there are, I think, 450,000 people, Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Yes.","Martin E. Stein","And even though the household income is typically below our $100,000 average, the purchasing power there is substantial. We've got a great grocer who's going to do very, very good. It is -- it does happen to be a presale because that's part of the deal, but we would be happy to own that asset long-term. It's got a Starbucks Coffee in there. I mean, the lineup of side shop retailers is excellent.","Brian M. Smith","Yes, I mean, you got CVS there, Panda, Starbucks, Little Caesars, Chase Bank, yogurt, dental. It is lower income, but I'll tell you what, not only does it have the population Hap talked about, but if you look at the Hispanic grocers in the area, there has not been a center built in there in 15 years because of the obvious high barriers. They all do about $800 a square foot, and not one of them that you can point to has good real estate fundamentals. Usually, they're not on the main street. They don't have good access. They don't have good visibility. They've got really bad physical property. And the other thing is, in those Hispanic areas, we have not changed our strategy, but I don't think you can ignore the demographics. It's not only the fastest-growing part of the population, but they spend so much more on groceries. The average Hispanic household spends 46% more on groceries than the general population per week, and they visit the grocery store 3x as often. So I think that is more where the priority is to spend money. And with the anchors we got there attracting the best retailers, that's also true in Fontainebleau.","Martin E. Stein","Getting back to a prior question because I indicated 19 years, I think it was Richard's question, I mean, having the team, the capabilities and the persistence and the dedication, this is a key part of our business. And if and when we do it right, we create substantial value. A lot of hard work.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Lisa Palmer","Prior to turning it back over to Hap, I'd like to close the loop on the TI question, excluding the 2 anomalies. So if you exclude the daycare center that Brian talked about, as well as the PetSmart, the TI for new deals would be $5.31.","Brian M. Smith","Yes, I think $6.75 is about where it usually averages.","Martin E. Stein","Thank you. We appreciate your participation in the call. Everyone, have a great day. I know it's a busy day, and we thank you for your attention.","Operator","That does conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation."],"18278":["Regency Centers Corporation (NASDAQ:REG) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call February 13, 2020 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Laura Clark - Investor Relations","Lisa Palmer - President and Chief Executive Officer","Mike Mas - Chief Financial Officer","Mac Chandler - Chief Investment Officer","Jim Thompson - Chief Operating Officer","Chris Leavitt - Senior Vice President and Treasurer","Conference Call Participants","Christine McElroy - Citigroup","Greg McGinniss - Scotiabank","Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank","Marissa Delikoura - BMO Capital Markets","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America","Rich Hill - Morgan Stanley","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Mike Mueller - JPMorgan","Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust","Linda Tsai - Jefferies","Chris Lucas - Capital One Securities","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Laura Clark","Good morning and welcome to Regency\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Lisa Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mas, Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Chief Investment Officer; Jim Thompson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.","On today\u2019s call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.","Today, we will be utilizing a slide presentation for a portion of the call. You can view the slide presentation through the webcast link or in the presentation section of our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone. I will start with a recap of 2019 and a few thoughts on 2020 and the future outlook before Jim, Mac and Mike walk you through in much more detail. Overall, in \u201819, we had a good year. Specifically, some of the key accomplishments from our talented team for the year were grew core operating earnings per share by 4.3%, which exceeded the top end of our initial guidance from a year ago. We ended the year at 95% leased. This represents the seventh consecutive year at 95% or better; started over $250 million in development and redevelopment projects; completed several developments that are great adds to our portfolio. We made substantial progress on our in-process projects and we have clear visibility to our future pipeline. Capitalized on unique acquisition opportunities, enhancing our portfolio quality through the additions of approximately $275 million of well-located, high growth properties most notably The Pruneyard and these acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of more than $200 million of lower growth assets.","We further improved Regency\u2019s already impressive balance sheet, solidifying our funding needs through 2020. We demonstrated our continued commitment to best-in-class environmental, social and governance practices. The list of those accomplishments is way too long to list all here, but I would like to highlight just a few. Earning the GRESB Green Star recognition for a fifth consecutive year, being recognized as one of the leading organizations in the country for top employee engagement scores, receiving the highest governance quality score from ISS, and finally, being recognized in Newsweek\u2019s inaugural America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies 2020 list as one of the 10 most responsible companies in the real estate and housing sector.","While we are really proud of these accomplishments, we acknowledge that disappointingly we did not exceed expectations in 2019, both ours and yours, specifically for same-property NOI growth. As we have discussed, leasing velocity in the first half of last year as well as store closures and bankruptcies drove us to the lower end of our same-property NOI growth range. But it is really important to note that we finished the year strong with full year leasing volumes that met our original expectations.","Looking to the future, as we indicated last quarter, we expect flat to slightly positive same-property NOI and earnings growth for 2020. However, we do believe this muted growth is temporary as despite the unique challenges of 2020, Regency is operating in a reasonably favorable environment for higher quality neighborhood and community shopping centers. Better operators in many categories remain focused on the importance of physical locations that provide our customers with a combination of convenience, service, value and experience. This is supported by sustained healthy demand for our centers with a deep leasing pipeline. We believe that the 10th demand we are experiencing from better retailers, restaurants and service providers, together with the progress on our redevelopment pipeline, will translate into future NOI growth beyond 2020, in line with our strategic objectives. The bottom line is that 2020 is below our standards on both an absolute and relative basis. But as I look to 2021 and beyond, I\u2019m confident that we will soon be meeting our objectives of 3% plus same-property NOI growth and 4% plus earnings growth. Regency\u2019s quality portfolio, value-add asset management and development capabilities, strong balance sheet, an exceptional team, truly position us to achieve these objectives and return to performance that will again be among the sector leaders. Jim?","Jim Thompson","Thanks, Lisa. Same-property NOI growth for the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, allowing us to finish the full year at 2.1%. Leasing ended the year with a very strong finish that met expectations for the full year. In fact, our Q4 new leasing production was the highest single quarter activity in the past 3 years and we anticipate this positive leasing momentum to continue through 2020. Our same-property portfolio was 95% leased, with shops at over 91%. While Regency maintains one of the highest shop occupancy levels in the sector, we did experience a decline of 30 basis points in Q4 driven by the expected move out of our remaining dressbarn locations. Our teams have been diligently working on backfilling these locations and currently have active negotiations or signed leases on all the recaptured spaces.","We achieved solid rent spreads of over 11% in the fourth quarter, which contribute to full year spreads of 8.5%. Importantly, this solid rent growth was on top of the average annual rent steps of over 2%. We achieved on more than 80% of leases we executed in 2019, even though we continue to experience healthy demand and deep leasing pipeline, weaker operators continue to struggle. In 2019, bankruptcies and store closures impacted same-property NOI growth by 80 basis points with Sears Kmart, accounting for roughly half of that result. We know the tenant failure has been and will always be a part of the retail business. And while it creates short-term disruptions to NOI, it allows us the opportunity to upgrade and refresh our merchandising quality and generate opportunities for us to unlock value. In regards to our Barneys location in Manhattan, the tenant is still in possession of the space, but has given notice that they will be vacating at the end of this month. As previously noted, this bankruptcy will have an impact of approximately 40 basis points on our 2020 same-property NOI growth. Our team is focused on the plan that maximizes value as quickly as possible, whether it be selling the property, re-leasing the space or redeveloping the asset.","Moving to 2020, we anticipate a total same-property NOI impact up to 140 basis points from bankruptcies and store closures. This includes a typical 60 bps from Barneys, IPIC and Sears, and up to an additional 80 basis points of known and unknown bankruptcy-related move-outs. Please also note that our bad debt is expected to remain in line with the past several years. While we realized store closures continued to earn a disproportionate number of headlines, we are excited to be working with thriving grocers and retailers around the country that are expanding in open-air shopping centers, including grocers, such as Publix, Wegmans, H.E.B. and Trader Joe\u2019s as well as an elevated number of retailers like Sephora, West Elm and Athleta. These prospering retailers recognize that our high-quality neighborhood and community centers provide what is critical for their success in today\u2019s retail landscape. Mac?","Mac Chandler","Thanks, Jim. During the year, we started more than $250 million of value-add developments and redevelopments as we continue to make substantial progress towards meeting our strategic objective to start and complete $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion of projects over the next 5 years. During the fourth quarter, we completed four impressive ground-up developments, including Ballard Blocks in Seattle, The Village at Riverstone in Houston, Pinecrest Place in Miami and Mellody Farm in suburban Chicago. These four projects speak to our development breadth and are a reflection of our talented professionals and unequaled platform.","Returns on these projects are in line with projections. The centers are over 95% leased and tenants are performing well, with many exceeding their initial sales projections. For the full year, we completed approximately $230 million of developments and redevelopments at a stabilized yield in excess of 7%. Our major redevelopments are steadily advancing per plan, including our pipeline of future opportunities. I\u2019d like to provide an update on several of these key projects.","Let\u2019s start with our office building redevelopment at Market Common in Arlington. This transformative project is more than 30% constructed as steel framing is complete. We have an executed lease with our luxury fitness operator to take 2 floors of the building and are negotiating with several users for many of the remaining spaces. We anticipate construction completion later this year with the first tenants opening in 2021.","Moving on to The Abbot located in the heart of Harvard Square in Cambridge. This project started in 2019. Construction is progressing smoothly, and we are approximately 20% complete. We have tremendous interest in our ground floor retail space and are working with a variety of users for the upper floors as well. We expect delivery late this year with the first tenants opening in 2021. Next is our Serramonte Center located just 3.5 miles south of San Francisco. We are excited to announce in the fourth quarter, we started on the first of our three-phase redevelopment. This first phase consists of the addition of a new Regal theater integrated with the insurer of the mall, a relocated fitness club, several new outparcel restaurants and a new hotel in a ground lease. The second phase of the project commenced in January and includes a long overdue modernization of the mall\u2019s interior that should complete prior to this year\u2019s holiday season and is already enhancing our leasing velocity. The third phase is the redevelopment of the JCPenney box, which we get back in June is arguably our best space. We are evaluating several scenarios to re-tenant and reconfigure the space, which is estimated to start in 2021. As we have discussed previously, approximately $1.5 million of NOI will be coming offline at Serramonte in 2020 as we execute this multi-Phase 3 development.","Moving to some of our near-term redevelopments, first, Westbard Square, formerly known as Westwood, located in Bethesda. We anticipate starting the first phase of this compelling mixed-use project later this year. As we\u2019ve previously disclosed, approximately $1 million of NOI will be coming offline in 2020 and an additional $2 million in subsequent years as we demo a portion of the current center in order to relocate our grocer. The project will also include 100,000 square feet of retail, 200 apartments, 100 units of assisted living and approximately 100 for sale townhomes. We will be partnering and co-investing with several leading developers for the non-retail components of this project. The new Giant supermarket in Phase 1 retail should open in 2022, and the Phase 2 multifamily ground floor retail should follow in 2023.","Lastly, Costa Verde, this dense infill property is located in the vibrant UTC market of San Diego, across from Westfield UTC mall and a new trolley station opening in 2022. This mixed-use redevelopment will include new retail, office and hospitality, and we are in discussions to joint venture the endeavor with the best-in-class office REIT. We anticipate starting the project in 2021. Accordingly, as we prepare for demolition, approximately $1 million of NOI is expected to come offline this year and an additional $3 million in 2021. Initial occupancy is projected to occur approximately 3 years after construction begins. These are just a few of the exciting projects our teams intend to commence and deliver over the next several years that will support our long-term objective of 3% plus same-property NOI growth. Our 8 major redevelopment projects, both in process and near term, are expected to generate approximately 45 million of incremental NOI in the years to come, representing almost $1 billion of incremental capitalized value. I look forward to providing you with further updates as these projects advance. Mike?","Mike Mas","Thanks, Mac and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to focus my comments on our 2020 outlook by walking through our same-property NOI and earnings guidance. I think the visuals will help with this discussion. So let\u2019s start on Slide 1 and I encourage those that can\u2019t follow the live presentation, its package on our website, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find the materials to be helpful. This first slide is a quick reminder of the components that make up our 3% plus same-property NOI, long-term growth objective. First, our embedded contractual rent increases continued to generate about 1.25% of growth annually.","Next, rental rate increases were another 75 to 100 basis points of growth comes from rent spreads in the mid to high single digits, which is consistent with our recent historical averages. And lastly, we need to consider changes in rent paying occupancy as this impacts base rent as well as recovery income, together with growth from our redevelopment activity, which has averaged a positive contribution of 75 basis points over the last several years. With that backdrop, I would like to walk through 2020 to better understand the outlook of flat to slightly positive same-property NOI growth that was previewed on our last call and confirmed with our formal guidance today.","Let\u2019s move to Slide 2, which outlines how growth is impacted by certain key assumptions this year. Contractual embedded rent steps and the contribution from rent spreads are in line with our long-term objectives. This leaves changes in rent paying occupancy and expectations around redevelopment contributions as the key drivers of our flat or better guidance. As we\u2019ve discussed on past calls, rent paying occupancy is impacted by 3 key sets of assumptions: first, fallout from tenant bankruptcies or store closures; second, timing expectations around our redevelopment activity; and lastly, our downtime estimates embedded in our forecast due to the timing and volume of leasing activity. First, from a bankruptcy perspective, we will certainly feel the impact of the unique material failures of Barneys, IPIC and Sears. In addition, as we have in the past, we have included provisions for actual and potential bankruptcy activity to include tenants such as dressbarn, Avenue and Pier 1 as well as other unknowns. In total, these could cause a decline in rent paying occupancy of approximately 75 basis points, which translates to the drag on same-property growth of up to 1.4%.","Next to redevelopment, as we have discussed on previous calls, we know that contributions to NOI growth can be uneven from year-to-year, especially given the size and character of our current projects. While we have been successful in completing projects and bringing incremental NOI online, at the same time, we are taking approximately $3.5 million of NOI offline in 2020, including at projects such as Serramonte and Westbard Square to position those projects for future growth and value creation. As a result, we are essentially projecting a net 0 contribution from redevelopment activity when you consider both the ins and the outs. The final component of rent paying occupancy is related to the timing and volume of leasing activity. In 2020, outside of bankruptcy driven move-outs and redevelopments, we are planning for up to a 15 basis point decline in average rent paying occupancy caused by the timing of our leasing activity, both execution and on rent commencement, which translates into an approximate 30 basis point impact on growth. Lastly, we expect a drag about to 30 basis points for other items, which include percentage rent and other property level income and expenses.","A couple of final comments on same-property growth, first, thinking about the next couple of quarters, we are projecting a negative growth rate in the first half of 2020 driven by the timing of prior year bankruptcy closures. And second and this is most important, as we look beyond 2020, we are encouraged by our strong leasing results and the progress we are making on our redevelopments. And as Lisa explained, this visibility gives us confidence in our ability to return to our strategic objective of 3% or better same-property NOI growth over the long-term, including taking a big step toward that goal in 2021.","Let\u2019s now move to Slide 3, which is a roll forward of our 2020 earnings guidance, where I will just \u2013 well, I will touch on just a few items. Our 2020 NAREIT FFO per share guidance range is $3.90 to $3.93. The contribution from the total NOI growth is expected to be minimal, with growth essentially only coming from ground-up development completions offset by performance of our non-same-property assets. And quickly, on our non-same-property pool, beginning in 2020, and as indicated on a previous call, we have moved Costa Verde into our non-same-property pool due to the scale of the project and major disruption in NOI of over $4 million that will occur over the next 2 years as we actively de-lease the asset. Transparency is an inherent value of Regency and in that spirit, we felt like this project, given its size, would materially distort the performance metrics of our remaining portfolio, both as NOI comes offline and also when NOI of about $18 million comes back online following completion. You can find property level information to appropriately model the impact of Costa Verde, together with additional disclosure around other changes in the property pools in our supplemental.","Please also remember that we sold approximately $130 million of equity last September on a forward basis through our ATM. We can settle this trade at any time through the third quarter, and proceeds were targeted to fund our outsized development spend this year, while keeping our leverage in check, which is a good time to note that we are now providing guidance on development spend, together with development starts and anticipate spending the $300 million area this year. Finally, non-cash items, which primarily include straight-line rent and above below market rent, are expected to decrease by approximately $7 million. As a reminder, in 2019, we recognized significant income related to the acceleration of below market rent balances following move-outs of a few anchor leases. This has increased the rate of deceleration on this line item.","And lastly, while we are only providing NAREIT FFO guidance, we will continue to measure and report the performance of our business using core operating earnings, which eliminate certain non-recurring and non-cash items. We anticipate core operating earnings growth per share to be flat to slightly positive in 2020, but we remain confident in our ability to return to 4% plus earnings growth over the long-term. As we look forward, the team is extremely focused on achieving our objectives, and we all remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver earnings growth, dividend growth and in turn, total shareholder return that is at or near the top of the sector. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Christine McElroy from Citigroup. Your line is now live.","Christine McElroy","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Lisa and Mike, you both mentioned in your prepared remarks about commenting on sort of getting back to that 3% same-store NOI, 4% FFO growth in 2021 and beyond. I think a lot of us are sort of looking to 2021 now given the flattish growth expectations in 2020. And Mike you sort of laid out those components. I am wondering if you could sort of help us bridge that gap from the flat in 2020 just to a more elevated pace in same-store in 2021, you have got the what\u2019s likely to be the 125 of contractual rent growth, the 75 basis point contribution from rent spreads, but then how does \u2013 how should we be thinking about the redevelopment contribution in 2021 given all the moving pieces and also the recovery in rent paying occupancy from the bankruptcies and move-outs that you\u2019re experiencing this year?","Lisa Palmer","Hey, Christy, it\u2019s Lisa. Good morning. I think you just answered the question with your question.","Christine McElroy","Well, it\u2019s really more the breakout of those last two, right, it\u2019s sort of occupancy versus redevelopment.","Lisa Palmer","Yes, because it really \u2013 so you start with we do have \u2013 the team has done a great job continuing to get contractual rent steps. Our leasing spreads are really healthy, right. So we are starting at 2%. And then we do have a lot of visibility as we have said in our \u2013 as we have said in our prepared remarks, as you have heard us say prior to the redevelopment contribution coming back in 2021, more like what it had been historically and that 75 basis point range perhaps even more certainly looking even better in 2022. But I am not giving formal 2021 guidance or certainly not 2022, we are going to execute on 2020 first and make sure that we meet those expectations. With regards to the rent paying occupancy, that\u2019s always going to be an unknown. But as we have said, 2020 really is \u2013 it was a rare, I think, Hap\u2019s words last quarter were a rare confluence of events to have two really large bankruptcies in Barneys and IPIC and add Sears on top of that. We just don\u2019t see that replicating in the future, because of the magnitude of those spaces. So, rent paying occupancy is certainly an unknown more than 12 months from now, so is economic uncertainty, but we feel really good about contractual rent steps, lease spreads and redevelopment contribution.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And then just as I think about sources and use of capital, you are looking at the $300 million of development and redevelopment spend which we appreciate that guidance. You have got $170 million of free cash flow that you have talked about, which generally would fund most of that on a leverage-neutral basis, but you are also sort of over-equitizing with the $130 million of forward equity. So I am wondering why the sort of additional $125 million of net dispositions on top of that, which is causing a dilutive impact to your FFO and sort of where does all that capital raising leave you from a leverage perspective at year end?","Mike Mas","Hey, Christy, it\u2019s Mike. Appreciate the question. The dispo guidance really is a carryover from \u201819. So this all in effect, goes back to our funding plan for The Pruneyard acquisition. So what I would say to balance out the sources and uses, which you nailed right there is that we are planning to reduce our overall debt level in 2020 by about $100 million to $110 million.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And that\u2019s sort of causing the lower interest expense guidance, there is...","Mike Mas","Yes, the lower interest is being driven by that as well as some accretive refinancings, we are going to do within the joint ventures in 2020 together with the accretive refinancings we executed on in \u201819 through the bond market.","Christine McElroy","Okay, thank you.","Mike Mas","Thanks, Christy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is now live.","Greg McGinniss","Hey, good morning. This is Greg on with Nick. I just want to talk about rent spreads a little bit, I mean very strong in Q4, healthier spreads we have seen this year in both new leases and renewals. Could you talk about some of the deals that you guys were able to complete this quarter to help boost those metrics and what you anticipate seeing from spreads in 2020?","Jim Thompson","Yes, Greg. This is Jim. As you noted, we had a real strong fourth quarter and it was really pretty heavy on the anchor side. Every quarter we look at the mix and we were heavy on anchors this quarter and we have some really good and pretty strong anchor deals. Publix, LA Fitness and Roosevelt, Edge Fitness, backbone of Kmart, all very, very accretive deals and help to increase that new percent leased or the spreads on new as well as the King Kullen grocery mark-to-market on the renewal side. So that was pushing the spreads pretty strong this quarter. But overall, I think we still target that mid to high single-digit, 8.5%, that meets our objective long-term and that equates to about a 15.9% straight line rent growth and both of those metrics are where we would like to be.","Greg McGinniss","Great. Thanks. And then just hoping to grab some clarity on transactions as well, so first on that is do you count \u2013 use incremental purchases to Town & Country into acquisition guidance, so basically, not much left to do this year and then on the dispositions, only $100 million at this point left?","Mike Mas","Hey, Greg, yes, that is somewhat of a technicality in our guidance. So, we have been \u2013 the initial entry into Town & Country, we did show as an acquisition, I think that was in \u201818. We have staged some acquisition \u2013 additional shares in the property throughout \u201819 and then this is in effect kind of our final piece hopefully not. And hopefully, we will find a way to buy them even more of this asset, but we are not including that in acquisitions guidance in 2020. In effect, I am thinking about that as added development or redevelopment spend at Town & Country. So, we do have a project \u2013 we have a project under contract in Southern California actually that we are excited about, honestly, probably too early to talk about that deal, but we look forward to making progress on our due diligence and potentially closing on that in the early part of 2020.","Greg McGinniss","Okay, thanks. And just a quick follow-up on transactions, can you just give us an update in terms of obviously, there is that one that you are talking about there. But in terms of other product that you are seeing in the market right now, have increasing CapEx needs start to bring more maybe high-quality mom-and-pop owned assets to the market and then what\u2019s the impact been on cap rates as well?","Mac Chandler","Greg, this is Mac. We are still seeing very \u2013 sort of very few of the types of properties that we typically buy on the market. So, that scarcity has really kept cap rates very low. Cap rates haven\u2019t moved in quite a while. The types of progress we are looking for are not only ones in the submarkets and traders that we do well in and have long-term growth potential, but also where we can use our platform and our expertise to really it\u2019s either core plus or a value add or somewhere we can really find some long-term growth beyond just a core acquisition. Not seeing a lot of those, but we are in the market all the time and just by nature of our 22 markets we see everything that comes to market.","Greg McGinniss","Great. Thank for the clarity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Derek Johnston","Hi, good morning everyone. So the Barneys is unique, but you did lower the carry value closer to market, has there been much interest in this space? I mean, are you evaluating it as a possible disposition or are you committed to weather the downtime in CapEx and is the associated redevelopment project baked into guidance?","Mac Chandler","Derek, this is Mac. I would be happy to answer that. We are looking at really three scenarios. Definitely sale, we are considering that and we are in the marketplace to see if that is \u2013 could transact it when we are looking to redevelop it in either a multi-tenant scenario or single tenant scenario. So we are in the marketplace too as well. So, all are very viable options and we are not going to limit ourselves to one of them. And as we get more clarity, we will be sure to communicate that.","Lisa Palmer","I think the most important thing as we are evaluating the options is how can we maximize value, really and time matters as well when you are thinking about returns to us as well as returns to our shareholders. So, how can we maximize value in really the shortest amount of time? And that\u2019s how we are thinking about it.","Derek Johnston","Okay, thank you. And just you mentioned the Market Common in Arlington, just wondering how discussions with prospective tenants for the office component are progressing? Office tenants tend to make decisions relatively early. And with yield compression being an issue that\u2019s being discussed out there, is the 9% yield still attainable on this project?","Mac Chandler","Derek, this is Mac again. We believe so. We have \u2013 having signed now Equinox, that\u2019s really a big boost to the product and the tenant tours that we have had have gone very well, very favorable, now that you can get actually up to the upper floors and see the tremendous views back there, which you couldn\u2019t until we got the frame completed. We have had great interest. Now it takes time to convert interest to LOIs into leases, but we feel good about where we are on the prospects and we will continue to communicate that as we start to absorb.","Derek Johnston","Okay, great. And just one real quickly on escalators, I think they were north of 2% towards the end of last year for new and renewed leases, is this holding firm in the current environment on new leases that you guys are writing?","Jim Thompson","Yes, Derek, Jim, again. We continue to have very good success in embedding that 2% increase in over 80% of our leases. So, we feel like we can continue to follow that tack.","Derek Johnston","Okay. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Marissa Delikoura","Good morning. This is Marissa on for Jeremy. I just wanted to go a little bit more in-depth on acquisitions. Specifically, what sort of upside dynamics are you looking for to keep paying a mid-4% cap rate in the current environment? And also that how is the IRR, you are underwriting changed if at all, in the last 12 to 18 months?","Mac Chandler","Hi, Marissa, it\u2019s Mac again here. Really, the upside, we underwrite a 10-year term just like almost everyone else does. And in order to get that IRR in the mid-6s, sometimes upper mid-6s, sometimes 7, they are paying the product tech you need really strong compounded growth and we get that through contractual bumps. Sometimes there is mark-to-market leases they are under market today. And then often in the \u2013 sorry, the second 10-year period, there is even more upside on some of this. That could be through densification. It could be through an anchor lease that finally comes due, that doesn\u2019t show up in our 10-year and those are the kinds of things we look for. We also look for improving demographics, neighborhoods, where demographs are trending up and in the right direction, so you might not see that in the leases that are signed today, but we think we can upgrade, not only rents, but the merchandising and in the physical plant to as well. Ours haven\u2019t changed materially for what we are looking for. We certainly are \u2013 we scrutinize our underwriting very carefully and we think that\u2019s obviously embedded in our underwritten IRR so not a material change to that.","Lisa Palmer","I think I just would add, if you think about \u2013 I mean Mac\u2019s exactly right if you think about where we have been successful in the properties that we have acquired really over the last 3 to 5 years. It\u2019s where we are able to bring our talent and our expertise, whether it be very proactive asset management, as Mac mentioned, or even our redevelopment and development capabilities. That\u2019s when we are really able to compete with the other buyers that are out there in the market. If it\u2019s just a straight down the fairway core shopping center, we haven\u2019t been quite as successful. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to turn these low to mid-4 cap rates into IRRs, sometimes north of 7% as Mac said.","Marissa Delikoura","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Your line is now live.","Craig Schmidt","I was wondering if you guys expect a pickup in small shop occupancy by year-end \u201820, particularly given the strong anchor leasing you\u2019re able to do in the fourth quarter, which you can sort of leverage against some small shops?","Jim Thompson","Craig, Jim here. Yes, I think with the momentum that we are seeing, we feel like we can pick up some ground. We\u2019ve talked about it. We\u2019ve had a high, I think, at 93% leased at one point. So I\u2019m not saying we could get back there, but I do think we\u2019ve got some runway, and I think we\u2019re going to pick up some around this year.","Mike Mas","Yes. Let me add some color there, too. I completely agree with Jim, what we are seeing in our forecast is that we will make up some ground on a spot basis and anticipate percent leased at the end of the year potentially increasing from this point. But importantly, and as presented in the materials, we are anticipating our ramp in occupancy to be down in 2020. And that\u2019s just representing that trough in leasing that that is a result of all of our leasing activity, signing new leases, commencing new leases as well as move-out activity.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. Thank you. And then assuming there isn\u2019t an outright sale, how long may the Barneys redevelopment to lease to different types of tenants, maybe, I mean, how long may make that \u2013 maybe that take?","Mac Chandler","Well, it certainly \u2013 if you went to a single tenant basis, it\u2019d be relatively quick, but a multi-tenant scenario, a reasonable estimate would be probably 2.5 years.","Mike Mas","Yes, and let me just add from a disclosure standpoint, Craig. As we refine that decision and move forward between sale and redevelopment, if redevelopment is the path we take, we\u2019ll certainly add that disclosure to our supplement and you\u2019ll get a better picture of timing.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Rich Hill","Hey good morning guys. We discussed last quarter timing of leases and move-out. And you sort of alluded to this at the beginning in the prepared remarks, but I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more updates on how move-outs have been trending so far?","Jim Thompson","From a volume perspective in \u201819 and \u201820 and I am going to limit these comments to the \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing in our shop space because I think that is where some of this \u2013 I think in the anchor space, it can be pretty volatile for the given reasons in those known identified tenants of Barneys and IPIC, etcetera. But on shops, we are anticipating a consistent level of move-outs year-over-year \u201819 and \u201820, and that number is in the million square foot range, plus or minus. And we don\u2019t see that kind of volume changing. If you think about that over a 4-, 5-, 6-year period, that level of volume is up on the margin, but we\u2019re replacing that with new leasing activity as well. We had \u2013 we signed over 7 million square feet of leases, and that\u2019s obviously including anchors. But the pipelines, as we look at our leasing activity remain full, and we are replacing the tenants that we\u2019re losing to move-outs. And I would say, we are upgrading the merchandising mix and the quality. And while we already have a very high-quality tenant roster, we are making improvement on the meaningful margin with every one of these new leasing transactions.","Rich Hill","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And Lisa, just to thank you for the bridge on the NOI, that\u2019s very, very helpful. So that\u2019s it for me.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you.","Mike Mas","I have to say, credit goes to Laura Clark on that. We find it to be a really helpful tool, and we appreciate that you all are finding it to be the same.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Wes Golladay","Hey good morning everyone. Just quick question on dispositions, every year, Regency has a strategy to shut the bottom tier of the portfolio, but when I look at the 5.5% cap rate this year for the planned dispositions. Is that more opportunistic sales and where are cap rates now for you \u2013 the bottom tier of your portfolio?","Mac Chandler","Wes, this is Mac here. A typical normal year is about a 6.5% cap rate. This year, 2020, we\u2019re guiding to a little bit lower. It\u2019s really because of 2 assets. There is two shopping centers that we are selling, one we\u2019ve already sold, and they are basically being sold to non-retail users. One is going to convert the property to a condominium development, that\u2019s the one in Florida. And the other one is a office user that\u2019s going to buy the property and scrape it. So there isn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve whittled down the income in those properties and that\u2019s \u2013 makes the cap rate go down. But in general, a typical is sort of the 6.5% cap, that\u2019s typically what we\u2019re selling and those are non-strategic assets in non-strategic markets and typically have lower growth profiles.","Wes Golladay","Great, thank you and thanks for the good quarter.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. So it\u2019s just \u2013 generally, we\u2019re not changing the kind of the identified kind of disposition pool, if you will.","Wes Golladay","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you our next question is coming from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.","Mike Mueller","Yes, hi. A quick question on the potential \u2013 the 75 basis points of occupancy headwind for 2020, how much, if any, of that was already reflected in year-end, 93% level?","Mike Mas","In the percent commenced?","Mike Mueller","Yes. Is anything in there already or is it that 75 basis point is all incremental starting on January 1?","Mike Mas","No. Some of it was in the percent commenced at year-end, like, for example, IPIC had already moved out. So to get you a precise number, Mike, I\u2019d have to come back to you offline. But it\u2019s not all incremental to percent commenced at year-end. Again, just for clarity, this is average rent paying occupancy. The 75 basis points you\u2019re citing is average rent paying occupancy year-over-year. So there could be some tag over from year end.","Mike Mueller","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. That was it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vince Tibone from Green Street Advisors. Your line is now live.","Vince Tibone","Hi good morning. I have a few questions on the Serramonte redevelopment. I\u2019m just curious given the stabilized yields or on the project are pretty skinny, and malls are obviously not your core property type. Did you consider selling the asset over starting that project, I\u2019d be curious to hear your thoughts on that?","Mac Chandler","Sure, Vince. I\u2019ll take this one. This is Mac. The yields are a little lower than what we typically see. And that\u2019s for a couple of reasons. The first is we elected to relocate the gym that operates there today. It\u2019s a very well performing gym. We thought it was worth it to move them out to a pad and replace them with a new theater. That\u2019s also going to add extra energy, the mall traffic to the interior of the mall that will help all tenants, and we think the gym will operate even better actually on a stand-alone. The yield also includes this modernization to the interior of the mall, which hasn\u2019t been done in a long time. And the benefit we see over that actually takes a long time to realize because we are very well leased. But as tenants turn, we are already seeing better tenants offering better rent and tenants that have always loved the location, but they were a little hesitant because the interior of the mall is a little outdated, and this will really help to that. So you\u2019ll start to see that benefit over the long term. And then the third phase is to JCPenney, which will take some time. We have got a lot of different options that we\u2019re still evaluating. We still are very bullish on the mall property. The location is terrific, and we\u2019re very comfortable operating it. We have some history now to it, and we really like the prospects long term.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. And I would just reiterate that. It is a really high-quality shopping center. Yes, it\u2019s a mall we don\u2019t own any other malls. But there\u2019s still a lot of value to be harvested from it as well. And we can really apply \u2013 we\u2019ve got and we\u2019ve got an exceptional team out there. And we\u2019re, again, applying our talents to that asset and really creating value. And in some sense, I know you\u2019ve had the opportunity to visit it, it almost is a community shopping center for Daly City. It\u2019s an exceptional asset.","Vince Tibone","Now it makes sense. That\u2019s really helpful. Just one quick follow-up on that, I am just curious, do you have to pay JCPenney to recapture that box or how did you end up getting control of that mid this year?","Mac Chandler","Yes, we had to make a \u2013 there is a very small payment to JCPenney. And that\u2019s what was driving that kind of rapid increase in our write-off of non-cash below market rents, starting last fourth quarter. JCPenney will be out, I think, end of May.","Vince Tibone","Right. Got it. So you bought the lease, but you always own the box, just to make sure I clarify that.","Mac Chandler","That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. And that whole \u2013 that entire property, we own everything, there\u2019s nothing \u2013 there is no separate pieces and we think that also gives you lots of optionality over the years.","Vince Tibone","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is now live.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks all. Good morning. So in the 2020 guidance, you have 140 basis points accounting for rent paying occupancy declines. And in your commentary there, you said 75 basis points from the known move-outs from Barneys, IPIC, Sears and some others. So can I take that to mean that 65 basis points is for unknown future events?","Mike Mas","I want to breakdown what you said there, Ki Bin, and just make sure we\u2019re all talking about the right numbers here because I think we were crossing over between rent paying occupancy declines and impact to same-property growth. So we are forecasting 75 basis points of rent pay and occupancy decline related to bankruptcy activity and an additional 15 basis points of rent paying occupancy decline due to the timing of other leasing activity. That translates to an impact on same-property growth. That impact on same-property growth is 140 basis points from the bankruptcy category, right, and then another 30 basis points from the leasing activity category. So I think \u2013 and then further breaking down that 140 basis points same-property growth impact, there is two categories, that we\u2019ve kind of segmented these three tenants that are materially driving our numbers: Barneys, IPIC and Sears is 60 basis points, and then everything else is 80 basis points. So let\u2019s keep digging in here, Ki Bin. It\u2019s a good question. We want to make sure we got through here. Of the 80 basis points, and that compares historically to a range of \u2013 in recent history, 10 to 80 basis points, around the upper end of that, roughly half of that is identified and that\u2019s the Pier 1s and the other tenants, dressbarn that we identified on the prepared remarks. And the other \u2013 the 30 to 40 basis points would be more speculative assumption based that we have in our plan. And that is just supported by our \u2013 just looking at the environment that we\u2019re in, considering what we experienced in 2019, we thought it was an appropriate level to carrying a plan.","Ki Bin Kim","And you think that the 40 basis point, do you feel comfortable with that, given what you have rolling over, what you know about your tenants?","Mike Mas","Yes, we feel comfortable with that, Ki Bin.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And how often are you guys doing preemptive rent restructurings with some trouble tenants before they go BK?","Jim Thompson","Ki Bin, this is Jim. We\u2019re in dialogue, as you can imagine, in today\u2019s environment, we get a lot of knocks on the door from tenant to asking the question. But our general position, I think I\u2019ve said this in the past, our general position is, we like our real estate. We feel very comfortable with our real estate. Sometimes sick tenants \u2013 it\u2019s better to take your real estate back and re-merchandise. So we play a pretty hard game when it comes to rent reductions and those kind of requests. Some instances, we will evaluate and determine that working with a tenant on a short-term basis with the landlord we capture might make the most sense, but in general, we play pretty hard on rent reduction.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you.","Lisa Palmer","On the changes \u2013 and the proactive asset management of upgrading the merchandising, we do that all the time. I mean it\u2019s just part of the business. And we do \u2013 and if I may say so, \u2013 I\u2019m not patting myself on the back. I\u2019m patting them same on their back. They do a really good job of it and have for a really long time.","Jim Thompson","We are \u2013 just to tag on that. We are very proactive take the dressbarns, for instance. We have 10 locations, and we just got them back Q4. And basically, all 10 are spoken for, so we\u2019re proactively leasing these things that we think have an opportunity to recapture. So that\u2019s part of the reason we can be strong in the negotiation because we know the real estate, we know what our opportunity pool set looks like.","Ki Bin Kim","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Please go ahead.","Linda Tsai","Tenant allowances on new leases were up a little in the past two quarters, 32 a foot in 3Q and 39 in 4Q versus 24 to 25 the prior quarters. What\u2019s driving these increases and will this remain elevated in the coming quarters?","Jim Thompson","Linda, it\u2019s Jim. As I indicated, the mix this year \u2013 this quarter was really anchor driven. So that was one of the reasons. Obviously, we continue to see increases in construction costs in general across the board, but it was really mostly the mix, and they were all LA Fitness, Talbots, Marshalls, Edge Fitness, great tenants, really good merchandising backfills. But at the end of the day, when we step back and look at our capital spend, we think that number is somewhere between 10% to 10.5% of NOI at the end of the day and taking out the quarter-over-quarter movements, we think that we\u2019ll continue to operate in that 10% to 10.5% NOI spend.","Linda Tsai","And then Amazon is opening a low-cost grocery store format in 2020 as an alternative to Whole Foods and Amazon Go. Will your properties see any of these openings? And if so, any store details you are comfortable sharing?","Lisa Palmer","Just as we answered that question last quarter, we are unable to talk about anything at this point.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Your line is now live.","Chris Lucas","Yes good morning everyone. Just a follow-up on Serramonte, Macy\u2019s had disclosed a store realignment programs, shrinking the footprint again. Have you guys had any conversations with them about your store there at Serramonte?","Mac Chandler","Chris, this is Mac. We talk to them all the time, and especially recently as part of this redevelopment. But they have given us no indication that they\u2019re unhappy with the store or they haven\u2019t requested rent relief or anything like that, so, no, new news in that front.","Chris Lucas","Any thoughts about being more proactive in terms of trying to buy them out?","Mac Chandler","We are always looking for opportunities just like that, just like we accomplished with JCPenney on that same property. So that\u2019s always an option that we explore.","Chris Lucas","Okay. And then we\u2019ve seen a couple of regional grocers file or \u2013 and\/or close stores first part of this year, Fairway, Earth Fare, Lucky\u2019s, you\u2019ve got a little bit of exposure to Earth Fare and Lucky\u2019s. Just curious as to how you\u2019re thinking about the sort of regional grocery player at this point in the cycle and how you are thinking about sort of your tenancy in that vein going forward?","Lisa Palmer","Chris, we really haven\u2019t changed our point of view. Generally speaking, as you\u2019ve heard us speak quarter-after-quarter, we really want to make sure that we\u2019re aligning ourselves with the better operators, with strong balance sheets, and with the ability to reinvest back in their business. So certainly, smaller operators and especially those with higher leverage, are facing more of an uphill battle. No question. And we continually are looking at that. It doesn\u2019t mean that all regional, smaller grocers are not going to be able to survive and thrive in this environment, but they have to have the ability to reinvest back in the business in the in-store experience as well as technology, delivery, everything that\u2019s happening in the world of grocery. It\u2019s an ultra competitive retail segment and has been for a really long time. And those better operators that have the ability to be flexible, nimble and actually innovate are the ones that are going to continue to succeed in the future. It\u2019s always disappointing to see any retailer sell, it impacts people\u2019s lives, but it is part of the business, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve dealt with for as long as we\u2019ve been a retail shopping center company.","Chris Lucas","Great, thank you. And that\u2019s all I have this morning.","Operator","Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Lisa for any further or closing comments.","Lisa Palmer","Just want to thank you all for your time. We\u2019ll see some of you, I think, in the next month or so and a very quick happy birthday to Madison, Greg and Amy. Thank you all.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"18270":["Regency Centers Corporation (NASDAQ:REG) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call February  9, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Laura Clark - VP, Capital Markets","Hap Stein - Chairman & CEO","Lisa Palmer - President & CFO","Mac Chandler - EVP, Investments","Jim Thompson - EVP, Operations","Chris Leavitt - SVP and Treasurer","Analysts","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Katy McConnell - Citigroup","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets","Jeff - Bank of America","Brian - RBC Capital Markets","Gary Jameson - UBS","Vince Tibone - Green Street Advisors","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Collin Mings - Raymond James","Chris Lucas - Capital One Securities","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Regency Centers' Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.","At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd like to turn the conference over to your host Laura Clark. Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Clark","Good morning and welcome to Regency\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements.","On today\u2019s call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.","Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.","It was great seeing many of you in New York at our 2018 Investor Day and we sincerely appreciate the time you spent with us. Since not much has changed since then, we'll be brief today. For those of you that were not able to attend or listen to the live webcast, please reference the replay and presentation on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Laura. 2017 was truly a remarkable year for Regency, as our people continue to demonstrate that they are the best professionals in the business. I'm extremely proud of Regency's 2017 accomplishments and how well-positioned we are to continue to achieve our strategic objectives.","To begin, in spite of the challenges in retail real estate, the team was able to push the same property portfolio to an impressive 96.3% leased and achieved same property NOI growth of 3.6%, which was the sixth consecutive year of about 3.5%.","This places Regency at the top of the shopping center sector for both of these metrics. Even though store closures accelerated and expansions of some retailers were more deliberate, we are continuing to experience healthy demand from successful operators.","During the year, our team continued to identify and start outstanding developments and redevelopments at compelling yields, bringing our in-process projects to over $0.5 billion. We also further fortified Regency's financial position and in times of market volatility like today, this is a very poignant reminder of why your strong balance sheet remains a critical component of our strategy.","In addition, we successfully completed the merger with Equity One, which has met or exceeded our expectations. The merger not only made us a larger company, but a better company and that's the most important thing.","To further enhance the quality and NOI growth of our portfolio, we sold a number of lower growth assets and purchased premier centers with superior NOI growth prospects some of which were highlighted at Investor Day.","It is worth noting that given the existing quality of our portfolio, Regency's capital recycling strategy is flexible and very modest at an average of 1% to 2% of asset footings. Yesterday we announced the implementation of a share repurchase program. This provides further flexibility to execute our capital recycling plan when pricing is compelling.","The impact on leverage should be essentially neutral due to the modest size of the program and similar to acquisitions we will be finding the share repurchases with the sale of lower growth assets.","Regency's combination of accomplishments was truly unequaled as evidenced by our superior shareholder returns over the last one, three and five-year periods. As you can imagine, our successes in 2017 in over the last five years had been extremely gratifying.","That said, given the ever-changing and challenging environment in which we operate, we fully realize that we can't afford to rest on our laurels. Our commitment to staying relevant and to being best in class will enable our deep and talented team to continue to capitalize on our unequaled combination of strategic advantages to execute our strategy and to grow shareholder value. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap and good morning, everyone. I want to start by echoing Laura's comments on Investor Day. Thank you, all for taking the time to join us whether in person or through the webcast. We are thankful for your support of Regency and hope you found the time spend valuable.","2017 demonstrated another strong year of performance as Hap said. Full year results were driven by strong base rent growth of 3.5%, a testament to our premier portfolio. And looking at 2018, there have been no changes to the previously provided NAREIT FFO and operating FFO guidance ranges.","As a reminder from Investor Day, operating FFO eliminates nonrecurring items as well as certain non-cash accounting adjustments. In our view, this metric better reflects the operating performance of our business and demonstrates our ability to grow cash earnings.","While we will continue to discuss operating FFO with you, we do feel it is important to emphasize that NAREIT FFO is currently the better metric for comparability across the REIT sector, given the standard definition. Therefore, we are asking the analysts community to report NAREIT FFO for consensus purposes going forward.","As we've discussed, we believe our unequaled combination of strategic advantages will enable us to consistently deliver same property NOI growth of 3% and operating FFO growth of 5% to 7% over the long-term. With 2017 operating FFO growth of 9% and our projecting growth this year, our two-year compounded earnings growth will meet this objective.","Our 2018 same property NOI growth guidance also remains unchanged. At Investor Day, I mentioned that this guidance incorporates some kind of fallout from move outs, store closures and bankruptcies. Since that time, there have been several store closure announcements including Toys are Us and our exposure continues to be minimal. Announcements to-date were incorporated in our guidance.","I would like to reiterate that given what we know today, we still expect to finish in the upper half of our 2.25% to 3.25% range, which would represent maintaining occupancy in the 96% area.","With Regency\u2019s prospects to grow operating FFO and free cash flow and given our low payout ratio, we increased our dividend, which would represent nearly 6% growth for the full year.","As Hap said, 2017 was a remarkable year for Regency with the successful merger and integration of Equity One and another year of impressive results. I can't say it enough; how proud I am of our team over this past year.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question is from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Could you -- in your press release, you guys mentioned some of the heavier anchor leasing driving some volatility in TIs and perhaps rent spreads. Could you provide little more color on that? And if there's anything -- anymore similar items like that in the horizon?","Jim Thompson","Ki, this is Jim. I'll answer that. As you mentioned, Q4 was relatively small sample size to begin with, but we did have high anchor activity, 6% of that activity was in the anchor side, which is about double what we normally expect to see.","That equates really to nine transactions on the anchor side. And just to kind of give you a flavor for the quality of those transactions we had to HomeGoods, [Addicts], Ultra and a Michael's.","We did have one outlier in Louisiana, which was a negative 59% rent growth. Backfilling a very difficult space and the best news in all of that is that, that asset is now ready for disposition. On spreads, when I step back and look at full year -- in the full year context, we were 8% overall. If you breakdown new deals from shop space, it was a 10% growth and new deal anchor was 12%.","When you net out the Hobby Lobby deal from early in the year, we talked about in the Backfill Sports Authority. So, in general, I think rent spreads look pretty good overall. Looking at moderating TI, again driven primarily due to that high anchor leasing activity. Anchors typically require a little higher TI. But in this particular subset, we had some interesting white box work that needed to be performed as well.","But overall, I would tell you that the quality of the re-tenanting is first and foremost in our minds and we will continue to deploy capital astutely to ensure we get the best-in-class retailers to re-merchandise our centers.","Lisa Palmer","Just to add a little bit of color, our outlook hasn\u2019t changed. You've heard us say this when we announced the merger at Investor Day that one of the compelling factors in the Equity One merger was a lot of the inherent mark-to-market of near term expiring anchor leases. And we still -- we still see that over the next two to three years.","Hap Stein","And if you combine those with the contractual rent increases that we\u2019re being able to generate as Lisa said, I think that we\u2019re well positioned to achieve our strategic objective of 3% plus same property NOI growth over the long term.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And the second question, I appreciate the share repurchase announcement. But if the environment -- the cost of capital environment kind of stays this way, does that change your thinking about underwriting at all or buying anything at all? Even though it\u2019s along your $50 million, does that change at all at a sub 5 cap?","Hap Stein","I would say, like the start of capital allocation and recycling plan is as follows; and we've been real consistent about this. We start with free cash flow. We sell 1% to 2% of lower growth centers and we reinvest that capital into compelling and outstanding development opportunities and acquisitions with superior NOI growth prospects.","And we've added what we think is the flexibility to invest with the stock buyback announcement, another compelling investment opportunity and that is to potentially buyback our stock and when it makes sense to invest in stock and repurchase shares in the stock, we'll do that.","It could be a very compelling investment opportunity and we're going to do all this in a way that's going to essentially be leverage neutral because I think more than anything else, in a volatile environment, maintaining a strong balance sheet is critically important.","Lisa Palmer","And I'd just emphasize and Hap started with this in terms of being very consistent about our capital recycling strategy. It is an important part of our strategy and we do believe that our outperformance and our operating metrics and our NOI isn\u2019t by accident.","And it is important for us to fortify that NOI growth to continually enhance our portfolio. It's something we've done for the past 21 years and we will continue to do that.","Jim Thompson","And we've done it on an incremental basis to where we don't have to do it on a significant basis. And on that incremental basis, it's paid dividends from NOI growth standpoint and from a portfolio quality standpoint.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Christy McElroy from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Katy McConnell","Good morning. This is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Given many of your peers are pulling back on acquisitions in this environment, can you talk a little bit about your willingness to continue to be a buyer today? And can you also talk about any changes you're seeing in market pricing and the buyer pools that are coming to the table today?","Hap Stein","I will start with the cap allocation. As I said, I think we've been pretty clear about this, is when it makes sense to sell our assets and reinvest those proceeds into acquisitions, we'll do that. But we now have the flexibility of rather than doing that it may be more compelling investment to buy our shopping centers.","If you look at our implied cap rate today, somewhere north of 6% of the quality of our portfolio, that seems very, very interesting to us. And that's part of the reason that we decided to put in place a stock buyback program and I'll turn it over to Mac to respond to what may be happening in the market for shopping centers.","Mac Chandler","Sure thing. Really what we're seeing is, starting with the A quality centers, the types of centers that we're looking to acquire are still tremendous amount of demand for centers in -- with productive dominant grocers in the best markets.","And in part there is really very little supply coming to the market in that we saw that in '17 and probably we'll see that again in '18. So that scarcity is also driving the demand there for the highest quality centers.","In the B category, sort of the B shopping centers, transactions are still clearing, but buyers are little more skeptical and little bit of softening there in pricing. Buyers are pricing in some risk, whether that's real or perceived more so than a year ago.","And then further down the scale, when you get down to power centers, some further softening there and I'd say fewer buyers in that product type out there.","Katy McConnell","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Good morning, Mac. Just following up on your comments on the shifting pricing environment, especially for the non-core low growth stuff. Any chance you can better quantify how much it's really moved in the past call it 60 to 90 days?","Mac Chandler","Jeremy, it's always a tough question to answer because it's so dependent on the grocer, the market even down to the intersection. And I think, what I would say is as you get -- as you get closer to the larger centers $50 million and above, probably the gap is more so than the smaller less than $50 million centers.","So, I don't have a very specific answer but 50 to 75 basis points over not 60 to 90 days, but over say six months, but it's one of those questions that tough to be very specific, we see different shades of demand and transactions in different markets.","Jeremy Metz","No, that's helpful. And then you guys mentioned getting a couple of those toys leases back. Once you get those back, would you look to release those as there is possibly great time, and then just once the mark-to-market on those today in your current configuration?","Hap Stein","Jeremy, we expect to get all our five toys. We expect to get two of them back. Quite frankly toys reached out for a reduction, which we declined and we rather control our real estate and upgrade our merchandising. On one of those locations, we are engaged with a attendant for reletting.","The other asset is in Boston, well merchandised center, so we'll look at breaking boxes up. I think the Boston space is a pretty good size box. So, we'll look at all opportunities. What we're looking for is again best-in-class merchants and we'll do we think an astute job of trying to select that backfill opportunity at the right market rate.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks. Probably it's pretty significant mark-to-market out there?","Hap Stein","As you can expect the three-week -- the three we didn't get back, we think there's a significant opportunity the ones that they rejected were the higher rent deals. I think we're 1450 up like 1438 in rent. So, I suspect there may be a little moderation, but it depends on how we end up breaking up boxes or going full refill.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And last question for me Hap. I know we're only about a month removed from your Investor Day, so not a lot of time has obviously passed. I was wondering if you feel any different today with regards to the retail environment close tax reform? Are you feeling more encouraged today or it is generally same as you did a few weeks ago.","Hap Stein","I think it's too early to tell. Obviously, what we've seen is the way the tax reform is I think it feels like there's more growth in the economy, but we're also saying more volatility in the capital markets, now it's going to play out, remains to be seen, but we continue to see robust demand from the better operators, which I think is good.","We didn't say the demand has picked up. It certainly has slackened off. We're 96.3% leased, almost 92.5% in shop space. So, we're starting from a pretty strong position and so underlying fundamentals of the business appear to be extremely healthy.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks for the time.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Jeremy.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jeff","Hi this is Jeff [Benton] for Craig this morning. Just wanted to go back to market transactions for a second. If you look at the Cap rate that you have in your guidance assumptions of 7.25% can you give us an indication of how wide that range could be?","Hap Stein","Mac, you want to answer that question?","Mac Chandler","Sure thing. Jeff, some of it really depends on an asset-by-asset selection. I'll give you an example, when you look at what we sold in 2017, what affected our aggregate cap rate greatly was Westwood Towers and that was really an apartment building tower within our Westwood project in which the lessee had a fixed option to buy the property at a fixed price and so that cap rate actually skewed quite a bit the aggregate just cap rate there.","So, when it comes to 2018 it will depend so much -- somewhat on the product mix. So probably too soon to say exactly what the range is going to be but we're seeing good activity on these -- on the properties that we want to sell. It did shift a little bit.","As the year goes on, we constantly are adjusting to what we take to market and what clears. So, can't get much more clear at this point. It really is an asset-by-asset selection and they eventual all roll up and that's why we give that plus or minus guidance there.","Jeff","No, that's fair. And can you remind us which geographical regions you want to remain in and growing versus shrink?","Mac Chandler","Sure, and Mac can follow back up on this, but we went through over this at Investor Day in detail and you might -- it might be worthwhile to go back, but we did a -- we worked with Costar to do an extensive market study to look at underlying demographics in the various markets to look at supply constraints and to look at opportunities to have a meaningful platform.","And the good news is that 95% of our capital is now deployed in the markets where we want to be long-term and that includes gateway markets, that includes stem markets, that includes growth markets and its a in our mind, it's an 18-hour setting like Atlanta and Dallas.","So we've got a wonderful canvas on which to invest in. We did identify, we have identified two markets where it may make sense for us to add a presence too. We're going to be evaluating that in the months to come, but we've got -- the target markets we're in right now where we have a presence where had enough to say grace over if we can find opportunities and ability to build a platform in those other two markets, great. If not, we're going to be fine.","Lisa Palmer","And the other 5% isn't necessarily concentrated in any one market that we're going to be exiting the market per se. When we talk about our capital recycling strategy and our property sale as Hap mentioned, we're targeting our lower growth assets. So, it's an asset by asset selection rather than a market selection.","Hap Stein","Correct, and again it's important to note because a number of those 5% that are in outside of what you might call are core markets, many of those are still really good shopping centers. I think offhand a public center in Tallahassee Florida where public performance is extraordinary and the center is close to 100% leased and we have a number of assets like that, that we can still effectively manage and are still good long-term assets, but they're not in the markets that we identify from a target standpoint.","Is there anything you want to that Mac?","Mac Chandler","No, I think that covers it. We haven't made any public announcement of us exiting one specific market, nothing like that. It's really an asset by asset selection as mentioned.","Jeff","All right. Thank you. And congrats on a great year.","Hap Stein","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian [Kaufman] from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brian","Hi. So just kind of building on the geographical analysis, can you talk about where you're seeing the most demand by region? And then also can you talk about the hardest space to lease whether it's by geography, size or location in the center?","Hap Stein","Jim?","Jim Thompson","We're seeing good solid demand really across the country. I couldn\u2019t really rifle shot any particular weakness or outstanding performance, but across the Board I would say, our demand is there. Within the shopping center there's always -- there's always boxes that are unusual in size and that's when we get creative and create the right box whether we tear down the back portion to create a box that is relevant in today's perspective.","But generally, I think we can get pretty creative to make sure that we create the right size boxes for what the market demands today. The other part of our which we went over at Investor Day which we call our DNA analysis and where we had a market study that identified the markets we want to be in.","We also did a study of what are the -- where are the corners that we want to be in the trade areas that have the right demographics, right purchasing power average household income, plus population density, the right education level, those factors and supply constraints. And so, our capital is deployed in premier shopping centers that are in great locations throughout the country.","Brian","That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.","Hap Stein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.","Gary Jameson","Good afternoon. This is Gary Jameson with Nick. Just looking at the Hewlett Crossing purchased a bit smaller than usual, but in very dense areas. Should we expect redevelopment opportunity there also with expensive pricing for A quality assets, are acquisitions generally going to centered around redevelopment opportunities?","Hap Stein","Mac?","Mac Chandler","Yeah happy to take that one. In that particular Hewlett project, we're expecting a modest redevelopment that it's not a large scale one that the property and performance work very today. It's needs a little bit of a refresh but not a full blown, one by any stretch.","It is a smaller asset, but we like it. It's got great growth. It's in the neighborhood. We think it's got great competitive advantages over the long term. It's very little product in that market. It's got parking, which other street retail doesn\u2019t have. So, we like that a lot.","I'd also say that, we love acquisitions where there is a major redevelopment component on it because we compete really well. Some of the institutions don't have the platform that we have and even our peers don\u2019t have the platform that we do.","So, we love opportunities like that. Town and country that we discussed at Investor Day is a great example of that and that's where the family that owns it really recognized our platform and our ability to transform the property and that was a significant factor for them when they brought us into their partnership. So, we relish those opportunities to use our platform to our advantage.","Hap Stein","And reiterating on that is from an investment in capital allocation standpoint, priority one, our value add redevelopments and developments and then outstanding acquisitions with superior NOI growth prospects. But value add redevelopments and developments are priority one from where we're going to prioritize the investment of capital.","Gary Jameson","You mentioned Town and Country, is that still looking like it's probably going to be a year out from now?","Hap Stein","Yes, still hoping with that schedule.","Gary Jameson","Okay. And during the Investor Day you highlighted Toys and Sears as the potential occupancy risks and were the two toys rejected in line with your expectations and what are your thoughts on potential closures from the five Sears and Kmart leases?","Lisa Palmer","I'll just take that from just -- higher level and how it's incorporated into our guidance. And Jim is welcome to add some specific color if he\u2019d like. But just reiterating again, the 100-basis point range in our same property NOI guidance of 2.25 to 3.25 does incorporate store closures, move outs, bankruptcies.","And the fact that we say that we're comfortable with, we're still comfortable with the high end -- the upper end of that range, which equates to about 96% leased and the fact that we\u2019ve already, we know we've gotten two toys boxes, we\u2019d tell you that yes that was incorporated into our guidance.","And the lower end of the range we think is reasonably conservative, but not necessarily what we're expecting in terms of how many of those we might get back. And again, so it's incorporated. In 2017 bankruptcies impacted our same property NOI growth by 20 basis points and our guidance for 2018 incorporates more than that.","Gary Jameson","Thank you, Lisa, appreciate that. Just final question for me, regarding the potential buyback, is this more likely that if you dispose $150 million in assets and there's not an equivalent level of acquisitions that might be funded or is if there's the potential for more disposition sales than that money might be spent on the buyback?","Hap Stein","I don't want to keep giving you the same answer but I will, is that our plan is free cash flow of about $160 million. Dispositions to enhance the quality of the portfolio and our NOI growth rate of 1%, 2% of lower quality asset a year and then we'll reinvest that capital in development first and secondly acquisitions.","And now we have the flexibility to substitute in investments in a great portfolio of great NOI growth prospects at compelling pricing and that's Regency\u2019s start and having that flexibility does remind me of a book that one of our Directors, Dave O'Connor mentioned recently that he wants to write at some point in his life which is optionality, is the key to life.","And I think that applies -- that flexibility and optionality applies and we have that optionality now. And I think that's important given the volatility in the market and it could be a compelling use of our capital.","Gary Jameson","Great. Thank you and I agree with the optionality comment as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Vince Tibone from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Vince Tibone","Hey guys. I was hoping to drill down a little bit more on the occupancy guidance, are you able to provide a little bit more color between anchor and small shop in terms of where you think some of the bankruptcy and store closure risk reside, is it all in the anchor space or is there -- do you see occupancy maybe falling a little bit on the shop side as well?","Lisa Palmer","Move outs and store closure happen across all the spectrum -- the full spectrum of store sizes. And don't expect it to be much different than what we've experienced in the past.","So, it really is -- it is almost kind of pro-rata and how you think about what makes up our portfolio. So, we are projecting that lower end of that occupancy guidance is a combination of shop loss as well as some anchor loss.","Hap Stein","But it's important to note as Lisa said earlier in answer to a question, that in the prepared remarks that we hope and we think there's a reasonably good chance we could end the year in the 96% leased standpoint, which would mean we maintain occupancy across the spectrum of anchors and shop space.","Vince Tibone","Okay. Great thanks. And then one more just on, I know it's early, but any specific change in tenant behavior you've noticed since the passage of the Tax Reform Bill?","Jim Thompson","This is Jim. I would say no. You read different articles about some excitement from small business owners, but really, I've not seen any indication of that at this point.","Vince Tibone","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s all I have.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. Obviously with bond yields up and stock prices down, cost of capital has changed. And I'm just curious, if you guys have changed your unlevered IRR hurdles for kind of both acquisitions and developments?","Hap Stein","In a sense yes, but number one from a development standpoint, our returns on invested capital and our IRR returns are well in excess of whatever kind of cost of capital that you might attribute to that. So that's number one.","And secondly, I think it does start with you got a $160 million of free cash flow. We're going to sell 1% to 2% of assets to enhance on a long-term basis the quality of the portfolio and NOI growth and its where do you reinvest that capital?","You can reinvest that capital in acquisitions with superior NOI growth prospects or now do you reinvest that capital into buying in our stock? And I think what we're saying is, is we see some visibility to where it may make compelling sense rather than buying acquisitions to buy -- to repurchase our shares.","Steve Sakwa","I guess it makes sense that the unlevered IRR on the stock is better than an unlevered IRR on a Class A asset I guess, you can find in the market today.","Hap Stein","I think there's a good chance that, that might be the case.","Lisa Palmer","But do want to remind you also that, it doesn't appear that we're contradicting what we're saying. We do have an asset under contract and we will on -- we're excited about that opportunity.","Hap Stein","And the other thing that I think we need to keep in mind is that you cannot continue to be in the market. We may be in a situation where we don't buy because we reinvesting the available capital. And as I\u2019ve said, key thing is we're going to essentially do this on a leverage neutral basis.","We may be in the market and we\u2019ll stay in the market because it is a volatile market and that may change also. So, we're going to take the capital from the sales and invest that as astutely as it makes sense.","Lisa Palmer","And the acquisition that we have on the contract is the northeast opportunity that we've talked about that we also sell our forward equity offering in December to fund that.","Hap Stein","And that was $70 plus per share.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess Lisa I mean you sort of touched on this a bit, so as it relates to just kind of your tenant watch list and things that have fallen out, I realize there's still a little bit of time until maybe the bankruptcy at least early window in the year maybe closes or we get a little bit more finality on that.","But just how are you feeling about the things that were on your shadow pipeline or shadow close list or kind of watch list today versus say a month or six weeks ago?","Lisa Palmer","Our outlook really hasn't changed since then. Toys did happen and it was within our expectations, which is why we still feel really comfortable at the upper end of our range for both same property NOI as well as occupancy.","And obviously there\u2019s others that will come this year and we're expecting that some will come this year. And our outlook has not changed from a month ago.","But as you said Steve, it's still early. Sports Authority did surprise a lot of people with the fact that they gave all of them back. And their best surprise could happen which is why we have incorporated more conservatism into the lower end of our range.","Hap Stein","And I would say Steve, it's a timing issue because long term we're going to be able to refill the boxes even the ones that we haven't closed, whatever the flag may be and more often than not, it will be to a better retailer at better rents not all the time.","But more often that will be those things and long-term because of the quality of the portfolio, because of the embedded mark-to-market opportunities and the contractual rent growth that we're getting, we expect to be able to generate 3% plus NOI growth and that is part of our strategic plan.","That mean it's guarantee, that mean there may not be little bit of short term pain if some of the stuff accelerates from a timing standpoint, but those tenants that are on the watch list have been on the watch list and if it happens, it's more spread out, we'll be at the upper end of the range this year, but long term that growth rate will be in the 3% percent range.","Lisa Palmer","And if I may reiterate one more time because I enjoy saying it, our exposure is low and that is not an accident. And we really do believe that is a result of our strategy and the consistent discipline that we have exercised in executing that strategy with a very modest amount of sales annually that enables us to keep that NOI growth a very quality NOI stream.","Hap Stein","A cumulative impact is meaningful and if I can follow on, it's also worth noting that we have released well over 95% of the recent bankruptcy spaces that we've gotten back in store closures that we've gone back, which speaks to the quality of the portfolio.","Lisa Palmer","And if can say it....","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.","Hap Stein","I wish we could say that was it for us. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","And our next question Collin Mings from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Thanks. Good morning. Just one question for me, just as far as development and redevelopment activities and the platform you touched on, just as you continue to bring additional projects into the mix, can you maybe just update us on what you\u2019re seeing on the cost side?","Again, we\u2019re obviously seeing some labor pressure in terms of wages things like that. And just how that's impacting maybe which projects are moving forward with us at this point.","Hap Stein","Sure, Collin. I would be happy to answer that. We're seeing the same cost increases that you mentioned, pretty much everyone is. I think we budgeted for them accordingly. So, we haven't been -- haven't had any tremendous surprises. And if you look at our pipeline that's in process, we've really been able to manage your costs and our returns very well.","As you look further down the pipeline, you may see some returns drop a little bit, but when we evaluate whether we want to go forward with those, we look at long term growth, we look at quality and we look at the very encouraging spreads to our development returns versus acquisitions.","So, every project stands on its own. Are we going to get let a small reduction in return? Teller project that we believe in long term, probably not, but we're going to let --- we look very hard at every one of those.","So, you'll see as we have more starts throughout the year, our returns in aggregate are pretty consistent with past years. What you will see is probably a bigger shift in the mix between redevelopments versus developments.","It's probably closer to 50\/50 this year. And in past years, it's been more maybe 70\/30 development to redevelopment. So that's one of the compelling reasons why we like the Equity One merger this embedded pipeline of redevelopment opportunities and we're very encouraged over the next five years plus as we start some of these projects.","Collin Mings","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Hap Stein","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Good morning, everybody. Just two quick ones for me I think. On the Toys, on the three remaining toys that you have, were there any changes to the lease terms as it relates to either lease duration, rents or expense reimbursements?","Hap Stein","No, we did not enter into any dialogue on modification leases. And as I indicated, we would cherish to get our real estate back on the other three.","Chris Lucas","Okay. Thank you. And then I guess maybe more -- a bigger picture context question, I think maybe three years ago on one of your calls, the tenant fallout was essentially historically low.","And I guess I'm trying to understand, in the current environment how would you rate the level of tenant fall out compared to a longer timeframe? Or is this a normalized level? Is this an elevated level? Or is this below average over a 20-year period?","Lisa Palmer","If I look really long term, it's still below the long-term average. But over the --with this increased closures and bankruptcies over the past year, it did tick up a little bit. And we are again forecasting it to be slightly higher than last year's levels in terms of as a percentage of your GLA.","But long term, at least for Regency that trend was declining and it stayed low and has stayed low and I think that that is a result of the quality of our portfolio. And the fact that we really have, I mean if you go back to mid-2000s and compare that portfolio what we own then to what we own today, we've significantly enhanced the quality of our portfolio and the quality of our tenant and merchandising mix.","Hap Stein","Just further little bit color on that. We are not immune to the disruptions in the store closures that are out there and we don't want to -- anything we say is, so we're not going to be immune to that.","We do think that the quality of portfolio and the focus of our accounts and operations team and is reinforced by the recycling, further insulates us from some of that that's occurring out there -- that will continue to occur. And that's what our expectation is, is the normal part of the business","Chris Lucas","Great. Thank you. Appreciate your time this morning.","Hap Stein","Thank you very much, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Regency and wish that you have a wonderful weekend. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"18128":["Regency Centers Corporation (NASDAQ:REG) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call October 29, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Mike Mas - SVP of Capital Markets","Hap Stein - Chairman and CEO","Lisa Palmer - CFO","Brian Smith - President and COO","Chris Leavitt - SVP and Treasurer","Analysts","Christy McElroy - CitiBank","Jay Carlington - Green Street Adviser","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Michael Mueller - JP Morgan","Chris Lucas - Capital One Securities","Operator","Greetings and welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets.","Mike Mas","Good morning, and welcome to Regency\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call.","Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","We also request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our results continue to be extremely gratifying. We\u2019re achieving Regency\u2019s key strategic goals and objectives. First we\u2019re sustaining a long term same property NOI growth in excess of our goal. As evidenced by excellent visibility into a fourth straight year of 4% growth.","Second our development team continues to source high quality shopping centers for development and redevelopment allowing us to deliver an average of $200 million of great projects annually.","Third, we are strengthening an already conservative balance sheet to disciplined match funding of investments and efficient accessing of multiple sources of capital. At the same time we\u2019re enhancing the intrinsic quality of our portfolio which is by all relevant measures one of the best in the sector. Ultimately the combined results of these strategies are consistently compounding core funds from operations and net asset value by 5% to 7% annually. As important Regency is well positioned to continue to consistently deliver on these key objectives in the future. Lisa.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you Hap and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our results this quarter with core FFO per share of $0.76 representing a 7% increase over the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date same property NOI growth excluding termination fees was 4.5% with base rate continuing to be the largest contributing factor as move-outs remain as historically low levels and we experienced gains in commenced occupancy. Through the first three quarters NOI growth has exceeded our expectations, although it is projected to moderate slightly during the fourth quarter as we face higher comps especially in the other income line item. We\u2019ve raised our guidance accordingly and we now expect full year same property NOI growth to be in the range to 4% to 4.3%.","Moving now to capital markets activity, I would like to spend just a few minutes updating you on the status of our forward equity offering. As a reminder we completed the offering in January on a forward sale basis. This allowed us to best match the proceeds with the intended use. As discussed at the time of the offering and on subsequent earnings calls, we identified three uses for the proceeds. First, the acquisition of University Commons in Boca Raton, Florida.","Second, repaying $100 million of near term debt maturities to further enhance our balance sheet. And finally, prefunding a portion of our ongoing development and redevelopment pipelines. We closed on University Commons in September and yesterday we notified the holders of our bonds maturing in the summer of 2017 that we will be redeeming a $100 million or 25% of that issuance at the end of November. Given the certainty of timing we\u2019re now planning to fully settle the forward at that time.","As a result of this early repayment, we\u2019ll incur make-all premium of approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter. This will be added back for purposes of [indiscernible] in core FFO. Driving for well laded maturity profile and managing interest rate risks, our both key balance objectives, it will provide us with more financial agility.","Today\u2019s capital markets backdrop and elevated maturities in 2017 support the partial retention as the most cost effective debt repayment alternative at this time. And further, we expect our estimated net debt to EBITDA to improve to 5.3 following the settlement.","In summary these capital markets activities combined with the continued strong results of the same property portfolio as well as some straight line rate increases driven by the exceptional leasing of our development properties resulted an increase to the midpoint of our guidance range for core FFO per share of $0.04 to a new range of $3 to $3.03. Brian?","Brian Smith","Thank you Lisa and good morning everyone. 2015 is shaping up to be another successful year by all key measures. On our same property basis the operating portfolio planned a 96% lease to quarter end. The largest growth continues to be in small shops which rose to 91.5%. Demand for quality space remains high well shop space move-outs as a percent of leased space continues to surpass historic lows. Despite the trend in move-outs translated into retention rate that exceed historical averages which is another measured portfolio health. Retention rate was very strong in 80% for the operating portfolio year-to-date again well above our long term average.","The momentum from the strong leasing trends gives me confidence from our portfolios ability to achieve additional occupancy gains as we continue to benefit from robust demand from retailers of the restaurants which \u2013 by low levels of new supply. The favorable leasing environment affords us to leveraged execute leases with higher starting rents and embedded rent steps. Rent growth by new leases signed during the quarter was nearly 19% while we continue to attain an average of nearly 2.5% annual growth embedded in the vast majority of our deals.","Our consistent occupancy gains and pricing power produce same property NOI growth in excess of 4% for five consecutive quarters and lease explained have enabled us to raise our earnings guidance for the current year. This positive trends also give us confidence in our ability to sustain long term NOI growth of 3% or higher.","Turning now to acquisitions, we continue to be able to find exceptional shopping centers with superior growth prospects. At least to mention as many of you are already aware, we closed on our most recent acquisition University Commons last month. University Commons is a 180,000 square foot center located on the major east-west quarter in an densely populated market of Boca Raton. It also benefits from a significant day time population from the nearby Florida Atlantic University. The center features a top performing foods as well as best in [indiscernible] for national retailers including [indiscernible]. With current rents at 25% below market there is a sizeable opportunity for this property to add to our long term NOI growth profile.","Focusing now at our ground-up development this quarter we completed our Persimmon Place project in the Bay Area. This 150,000 square foot center took only 20 months from the start of construction to completion and had 99% leased incremented. We\u2019ve already received overwhelming positive feedback from our line up a fresh tenant to share, they\u2019re performing well beyond their expectations. The exceptional quality and performance of this project demonstrate the accurate, best in class development team and has already led the new development opportunities.","After the close of the quarter we purchased three acres of land adjacent to our end processes line market in Dallas for second phase of this already successful alters into project. CityLine phase 2 which is 100% leased even before breaking ground will have an 22,000 square feet to the 80,000 square foot center already under construction. We\u2019re projecting a return of 8.6% on invested capital for the second phase.","Looking briefly on dispositions during the quarter we sold Glen Gate in Mariano\u2019s anchored shopping center in Chicago for $50 million for a cap rate of 5.1%. Consistent with our match funding strategy Glen Gate was identified as a potential disposition for the funding of the acquisitions given it\u2019s lower than average growth profile well also enabling us to reduce our exposure to Roundys. As evidenced by the increased guide range for acquisitions, we do have a good visibility into compelling acquisition opportunity in the north east at a comparable cap rate to Glen Gate sale.","Lastly I would like to touch on [Hagen] in light of their recent announcements. The six locations represent a minimum amount of base rent in our portfolio and with restock and gross debts our potential exposure is less than 13 base points. The good news is we\u2019re confident in the desirability of our real estate and our ability to enhance the quality of earnings accounts. With average base rents in the single digit there is potential to unlike substantial growth and redevelopment opportunities. In addition the leases are guaranteed by [indiscernible].","Thanks for listening, we\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operation Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy with CitiBank, please proceed with your question.","Christine McElroy","Hi, good morning guys. Lisa to follow up on your comment, in November do you expect to settle this form out of the equity offering and then did the sale of Glen Gate to help fund the Boca deal impact to your decision to go via the settlements?","Lisa Palmer","Yes. As you know that cash is fundable, we did complete our bond offering in the middle of August and where we closed on University Commons in September. And the Glen Gate sale did happen, but even with that said we still intend to fully settle the full amount at the end of November. And the Glen Gate proceeds have been earmarked for the increased acquisitions in the guidance that we gave.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And then Brian, just looking at your acquisition guidance beyond the Boca deal, sorry if I missed this, is there another deal that you are close to that maybe you have under contract at this point I notice that it\u2019s now up to $80 million to $90 million, I didn't know if there was an $18 million deal you are working on?","Brian Smith","We do. We have got \u2013 we have a couple of properties under contract in the North East. We are in the process of due diligence right now and we would \u2013 we haven't determined yet if they are going to close because the due diligence that we do have a couple under contract.","Lisa Palmer","And one is a little more certain than the other which is the one that we have included in the upper end of the guidance.","Christine McElroy","Where in the North East?","Lisa Palmer","That's on the long island. And the other one is in the Boston area. ","Christine McElroy","Great, thank you. ","Brian Smith","Thanks Christine.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Carlington with Green Street Adviser. Please proceed with your question. ","Jay Carlington","Thank you. Lisa or maybe Brian, I am just kind of wondering how difficult is it to forecast the redevelopment contribution at the beginning of the year?","Lisa Palmer","What we do is that basically the answer \u2013 right at this time now we are looking at all of our potential redevelopments that may begin over the next 12 months. In many cases you are going to need something else to happen though. We usually have pretty good visibility a year in advance. So, we have a pretty good understanding of what\u2019s going to happen. However, there could always be delays. It could be that you are negotiating with an anchor that's already in there right maybe for an expense, tear down, rebuild, and that is \u2013 there is always some uncertainty to that timing. But roughly we have pretty good visibility into the next 12 months. ","Brian Smith","This is just the start to and when the anchor decides we want to open and sometimes that changes. We got the permitting but then we also have approval that are also required by the other anchored and that can take a longest amount of time.","Jay Carlington","Okay and maybe a quick follow-up to that I guess, how does your year-to-date redevelopment contribution compared to kind of what you are thinking at the beginning of the year?","Lisa Palmer","I think we are pretty much right on target.","Jay Carlington","And Brian, did put a question here, kind of want to get your thoughts on, if you think the markets observing the recent wave of bankruptcy that we\u2019re seeing in and the store closures and maybe some of the mergers that are coming down the pipe that may result in other store closures?","Brian Smith","I haven\u2019t seen much concern about the store closures impacting us, we don\u2019t have that many big boxes and the kind of assets that we\u2019ve got, we\u2019ve got \u2013 I think of our vacant big boxes half of them we\u2019ve activity on. The bigger issue in terms of the bankruptcies and the mergers so forth is, what it means for developments going forward it means, right now all the activity and developments coming from the grocers and largely from the specialty grocers, but they have all got their 16 pipelines full, they\u2019ve got their 17 pipelines full and then you got all the [Hagens] on the west coast where people were wondering what\u2019s going to happen there and still have \u2013 down in Chicago, you got the AMPs that are out there, you still have some recommends.","So, it\u2019s more, can we get any development going, I\u2019d say the flip side of that the good side of that is the grocers are only taking the top deals given those pipelines are full and given the excess inventory out there. So, if you got one, then it\u2019s really, really good projects.","Lisa Palmer","Jay, I want to go back to your first question, I think something that\u2019s really interesting about the contribution of redevelopments. The ones that are already in process, we\u2019ve really good systems in place to understand what that contribution is going to be. It\u2019s those that we haven\u2019t started yet that we may or may not start in the current year that we\u2019re trying to project and could be \u2013 property is not considered a redevelopment until we put it in the supplemental in our disclosure as a redevelopment and a great example of that is the center that we have in South Florida near the Adventure Mall that we have been allowing tenants leases to expire so it\u2019s not very well occupied because we\u2019re getting right into a full scale redevelopment there and that is right in our same property pool. It is not considered a redevelopment even though I believe the asset is 70 some percent brand. So that one is most difficult.","Jay Carlington","Got it that\u2019s very helpful, thank you guys.","Brian Smith","Thanks Jay.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group, please proceed with your question.","Jim Sullivan","Just kind of a big picture question Hap, the internal growth here has been exceptionally strong and with cap rates in the acquisition market being as low as there, I guess when we think about the value creation margin with your both ground-up developments as well as redevelopment set back grant that margin is probably as high as do you ever seen it. I\u2019m curious and this sort of goes on \u2013 follows what Lisa just said, but the redevelopment opportunities in the portfolio were seen to be very value accretive, and I wonder if you think about those as a source of growth on the one hand as opposed to what I\u2019ll value add acquisitions. Do you see scope for more growth and either both of those given how profitable they\u2019re \u2013 value accretive they are given the margins?","Hap Stein","Well, there is no barriers of our capital then a redevelopment of the existing portfolio because what we are doing is we are enhancing typically and already good center making a great center, we are getting an attractive return on capital and we are going to increase our growth profile on a go forward basis. So that's \u2013 that is priority one. Priority two would be we still believe that ground up development in the exceptional cases that Brian indicated still make sense and we can do that hit margins. Well not as good as they were coming out of the downturn. We are not as good today but they are still very compelling and we are building great shopping centers that are going to be great addition to our portfolio in the long term basis.","And then thirdly, from an acquisition standpoint, what we are doing there is we are incrementally increasing our growth rate. We don't consider that to be an immediate value creation but we are selling like in the case of Glen Gate a low growth asset in addition to that we are reducing our exposure to round these and reinvestment that capital at roughly comparable cap rates into the shopping centers that's going to generate much more growth longer term.","Jim Sullivan","And I am curious in terms of, as you think about that acquisition market cap rates of course have come down and stayed low for some time now. And there seems to be a significant number of potential buyers out there who want to stable project, well located with long term leases and place. Just how competitive is the acquisition market for the value added acquisitions something where there is some hear on or some issues that maybe that long term stable coupon type buyers now really looking at it or looking for maybe as a scale set to redevelop?","Hap Stein","I think Brian can add color to this. I think market is still is very competitive. But from an acquisition standpoint an acquisition with upside potential would be our top priority. And one of the properties that we are working on in the North East has that both \u2013","Brian Smith","We basically have two and one that we are trying to get contract. So we have got three of those we are working on its competitive. I mean all the acquisitions are competitive. We are seeing in the a), grocery market is what we thought our cap rates from Florida four and three quarters we had to compete [indiscernible] going in the low four and whereas I thought the IRRs were then around six and we are seeing 6 to 6 in the quarter we are not seeing couple of properties grow a remiss by a wide margin where pension funds are sold per 5.5 to 5.3 quarters on leverage side. It's competitive in the As and it's competitive in the value add. ","Jim Sullivan","Okay, great, thank you. ","Brian Smith","Thank you Jim. ","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. Brian given the six locations from [Hagen] would there still be grocer and if they are what are some of the names you like to replace them with?","Brian Smith","Well, there would be grocers for all six properties we\u2019ve got interest, in fact on five of them we have at least two, I am sorry five of the properties have at least three interested parties and there is two interested for all six and some of the names that they are out there stocking, you got smart and final and we have also got [Galsons] and we love [Galsons], in particular there are \u2013 they are more compatible I think with their high end demographics but you got target [inaudible] interested there is whole -- North West [Winco] is interested. [Lazy Acres] which is part of \u2013 farms so pretty much a whole host of good names.","Craig Schmidt","Great. ","Brian Smith","And the offers that are coming in are also remains to be seen whether we can get control of these leases are whether they\u2019ll \u2013 by somebody else at auction one of the grocers but the offers that we are seeing are just really, really strong I mean you talked about $4 rents going to $28. ","Craig Schmidt","Wow! And then I notice for ABR you have got 17% restaurants given the consumer demand for this type of product, would you be willing to raise that exposure?","Brian Smith","I think we love to have as many great restaurants as we can get. The problem is that we are restricted, in some cases we are restricted by the grocers who have prepared food they want to sell and the biggest issue would be the parking and city code how much restaurants you can do.","Craig Schmidt","Great. Thank you.","Brian Smith","Thanks Craig. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Moore","Hi. Good morning guys. Last quarter you mentioned that you were looking at about $650 million of potential development is that still the case?","Brian Smith","It is. We are working on $650 million in 2015 and 2016, we are getting near the year end I think we are going to \u2013 you\u2019ve seen our guidance I think we will end up it's a very high end of that guidance and then next year it's going to be a strong year. More guidance to come but I wouldn't be surprised if we were in the $250 million to $300 million range and so therefore we would be averaging around that $200 million a year that we talked about lumpy but on average we are going to hit it.","Rich Moore","Okay. So do you Brian still feel that within the last quarter you said you felt that the current environment was the best environment you have ever seen for tenants and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of, I don't know maybe uncertainty in some of the other reports this quarter, do you still feel like it's the best quarter you have ever seen \u2013 the best environment you have ever seen for leasing and for your business? ","Brian Smith","I do think it's still the best environment just given the fact that there is so little development going on that the retailers are doing well. I mean when I look at our portfolio I see nothing that's showing any reason for concern I mean the leasing environment is strong, that there is no let up in momentum when it comes to the new leasing, tenants are not moving out. We have had the second highest year of renewals in our quarter renewals and the lowest quarter of move-outs. All those trends continue really, really strong. The only thing that I would say is that whether it's talking to brokers out in the market if you go to the regionalized CSC, you go to ULI I think everybody is and if you talk to our own tenants they are just cautious. They are taking a long time to open. They are being very, very careful about opening new stores and that\u2019s part of why I think it's a really good environment because nobody is getting caught up in the exuberant. And they can't really point anything but it's just that market is nothing to worry about little bit you hear that the traffic is down but conversions of sales are up. So, it's just that I think it's a healthy caution out there. But it's not translating to anything we\u2019re seeing in our current metrics or in our pipeline.","Hap Stein","Just reiterate that last point that Brian made, is I think this healthy caution on the part of retailers and restaurants and tenants in general is a very healthy trend because you are not sitting there, they are making it appears to be very rational decision and on the last cycle sometimes maybe we should have scratched our head and said, what the tenants doing doesn't make sense or why are they doing that now they are cautioned and they are \u2013 when they do move forward it does make sense so I feel good about that.","Rich Moore","Okay, good. Thanks guys. The other thing is I wanted to ask you second \u2013 it was a [Liddell] on two German grocers are you running into those guys and kind of what you think of them?","Brian Smith","We are putting all the \u2013 in one of our centers a back filling them and then up in North Carolina [Liddell] is going across the street from one of our developments. I don't know anything about [Liddell] I hear what they are talking about that we heard about that from Fresh Needs on the West coast that didn't pan out so I just reserve comment on that one. All the I would say by and large I think they are obviously good retailers and they drive a lot of traffic but they typically are going to go and demographics are different from our portfolio.","Rich Moore","Okay, good, great. Thanks very much.","Hap Stein","Thanks Rich. ","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Mueller","Couple of questions on the Boca acquisition I mean, should we think of that as just stabilized core acquisition or is there something significant that you kind of do with it overtime?","Brian Smith","Well yes, I mean we have a saying around here that we would like to invest in properties where bad news becomes good news and this is the ultimate center like that I mean the bad news here is that the tenants are generating mall like sales, I think they are averaging about $850 a foot across the entire center. It is now the number one whole foods in our portfolio. [indiscernible] if the sales are absolutely at the top of their chain. Same with [indiscernible] and beyond. We get calls through brokers, competitors, head of real estate congratulating us. So the growth you see there, it's about 3% is contractual over the next ten years but after that we are going to see a lot of growth and it's any of these retailers \u2013 whoever should go out the rents across the board are about $1.6 million below market. So if you could just bring that up to market, which we will get to do obviously eventually I mean there is a huge pop in value.","Michael Mueller","Okay and then you talked about contractual growth. Can you just walk through I know you have been trying to push bumps a little bit harder get more frequent bumps in leases, get higher escalators, can you just kind of walk through how that whole process has been trending in the past couple of years? ","Brian Smith","Sure. If you look at our \u2013 we have been focusing on this for two and three years \u2013 we\u2019ve been focusing forever, but the focus on the midterm steps is relatively new. So our portfolio on the deal specific basis so just the leases that contain round steps averages about 1.6% if you look at what we average for the last three quarters it's about 2.3%, so 70 basis points higher. That's pretty significant and then if you translate that into all leases including those that don't have steps but remember we are getting this now from about 90% of our tenants. The growth in the portfolio is about 1.2% and we have been averaging over the last five or six quarters about 2% so really, really healthy midterm increases.","Hap Stein","And you have to take time that percentage increase but I think we are projecting with the next three to five years we got to be another 30 or 40 basis points in that.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Evercore, please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning guys. As you guys kind of look in the next year and I know that you haven't provided any kind of official guidance could any kind of this proactive re-tenant or re-bunch merchandising efforts that impact NOI growth like some of the other REITs or sort of start to mention 4Q next year, could that impact growth I am just trying to get a sense of how should we think about growth rate for next year?","Lisa Palmer","As we have communicated in the past we believe that we can generate 3% plus same property NOI on the sustainable basis given the quality of our portfolio along with some of our re-tenanting and redevelopment activities and we hope that that would get us to the 3.5% range. I will remind you that this year if we stay north of 4% which is looking extremely likely at this point that that will be our fourth consecutive year of 4% and as you know, for our product type that's difficult to achieve and so something that we are really proud of. When you think about the contribution of redevelopments and Jay was asking this earlier it is going to vary and it's going to depend on how many properties that we are actually redeveloping at one time and we have given general direction that we would expect that that spent could be $20 million to $50 million and so at any given year redevelopments could be a positive contribution of 50 basis points roughly to 100 basis points. And so if you think about our contractual rent steps that Brian just talked about plus our rent growth that gets you to about 2.5% and then the redevelopment activities would add $50 to $100 so that's your 3% to 3.5%.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it and just curious on your thoughts about [Howard] square assets that one of your peers announced this morning as an acquisition. I know you guys likely looked at it considering your interest in sort of increasing exposure to the North East?","Brian Smith","I am not aware of it.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. It was one of your peers announced that acquisition I was just curious. Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities, please proceed with your question.","Chris Lucas","Good morning. Just wanted to see if there has been any change in the cycle or getting leases completed, in other words have tenants been accelerating the process or they have been slowing down given where we are in the cycle?","Brian Smith","I think it\u2019s slowing down. If you look at our down time it was above this quarter, so largely that's because we are leasing space and they can last longer. I think if you look at the vacant two to three years we did 49% of our leasing was in that category whereas just the prior quarter just 34% so that accounts for some of it. But I think overall it's taking longer because everybody is just battling. It's kind of what happens talking about they are going to be really careful about not doing a bad deal. We are fighting for all those things that just take a lot of time and we are striving to get not only the economics like fighting for the initial rent growth or the bumps in there but things like termination rights, relocation rights, so we can do renovations and redevelopments. We are fighting those kinds of things. So a lot of it\u2019s a negotiation and then just getting the stuff through the cities is taking an awful lot of time. Having said that if you look at our development that\u2019s working on right now I mean lots of rep, as we parked out and we expected it to, we talked about Persimmon on the call but that thing in 20 months is 99% leased and now we have started CityLine phase two and we haven't broken ground it's 100% lease. And I think the first phase is 98%. So, we are getting things done very rapidly. We are finding robust demand. We are working on a project in Huston and we hope to announce next two or three months and that one maybe three months away from closing and we have activity on 93% of the space. So, while they are cautious and while there is many things to slow down the process and it is taking longer, it\u2019s still pretty robust. ","Chris Lucas","I guess the follow up then Brian would be and you mentioned that Huston and so maybe I will call that out, but are you seeing the decision making processes that being impacted by market or is it very specific to location?","Brian Smith","I don't think it's that specific to location. I think the locations we have people are excited about it's just getting the leases signed. It's difficult we have that situations where retailers will change their hurdles and they will have to go back to their committee and again you get through that it's a good thing because they are being cautious but I think that's more across the board rather site specific.","Chris Lucas","Okay. great. Thank you very much. ","Hap Stein","Thanks Chris. ","Operator","The next question is from [indiscernible] with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. Brian I was just wondering if you could quantify the move-outs in the quarter relative to your expectations and then maybe I will just start to think about 2016 is there any reason to think that move-outs will normalize or do you expect that they will continue to be these historical levels?","Brian Smith","Well we haven't been very good at predicting that. It is pleasantly surprised us \u2013 surprised last two years. What we do is we do two things and try to estimate them. We start with the field and go space by space, who is struggling, who do you think is going to be moving out, who told you they\u2019re going to move out and we start there and then what we do here Jacksonville, we make an adjustment and what we do is we look at the trend of move-outs not absolute but as a percentage of occupied space. And then stuff happen. That trend has been on a downward slope since 2010 but also a bit accelerating so in 2014 it was 1.6% of occupied space, so in 2015 we budget 1.7 and year-to-date it's 1.4. So I don't see anything right now that would, well it's getting so low you would think that if it just flattened out at this it would be great because our move-outs for this full year are going to be about a million square feet less than it were in the 2008 \u2013 2010 time frame so at some point they can\u2019t keep going low. But I don't see anything that's going to cause that trend up.","Lisa Palmer","I will add that I mean Brian hit it right on it's just really difficult we are \u2013 we have been talking about this internally because we really have continued to overestimate what we have thought move-outs would be and it might offset by chasing all downhill. So in 2010 or 2009 with the highest, but even 2010 is a little bit more of a normal year the number was 2.4% and it fell to 1.6% of occupied space basically of people moving out and we thought we were being reasonably conservative if you will by budgeting 1.7. So thinking that move-outs would stabilize the quality of our portfolio has significantly improved. The tenants help has significantly improved and all that is contributing to and this continues to improve and we don't know when it will stabilize and obviously at some point it's going to go the other way. And so, we are trying to being as reasonably conservative but realistic.","Brian Smith","Virtue of cycle is a good thing. ","Unidentified Analyst","And then maybe just one more question following up on Texas I can see the leased rate is up versus last quarter but I guess I am just curious what you are hearing from retailers about there is sales in that market and if you are seeing any change in future demand there? Thank you.","Brian Smith","Sure. So what we are hearing is kind of what I mentioned before for those in the portfolio everybody is happy. Nobody is moving out. The renewals are up again. But they know there is going to be a slow down at some point. But if you look at the new demand our pipeline is stronger now than it was even a couple of quarters ago and again what we measured that as a percentage of vacant space. I will talk about new leasing so if you look at this year it looks like we are going to lease about 71% - 72% of our vacant space. If you compare that to the average in last five years, the average last five years about 75% so it continue to do a lot of new leasing not so much on absolute basis but we continue to lease a smaller and smaller amount of vacancies. And if you look at our pipeline it was over the last four quarters about 46% of vacant space and this quarter it's 54% so tenants start moving out we are continuing to do a lot new leasing and the pipeline behind it remains strong.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. great. Thank you. ","Hap Stein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good morning.","Brian Smith","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","So, a question for you first on construction labor, I wonder if you are seeing any labor related bottleneck in your development activities. I asked because the number of home builders in particular who share your market footprint largely have noted these labor related bottlenecks I am curious if you are seeing anything on that front?","Brian Smith","You see those on the smaller projects. I mean overall we have not experienced the problem. We are aware of where cost are trending and we budget for them. But you are right, whereas material costs are pretty benign that labor is increasing I think what\u2019s driving that is the construction spending and spends of 2008 and you are seeing worker shortage is growing. The unemployment for September was 7 year low and employment was 6 six year high and the interesting thing is if you look at the actual wage increases year-over-year it was the highest since 1986. And we are seeing across the country especially in the Mid West the associated general contractors reporting significant labor shortages. So that's translating this past year about 5% increase and 4.5% increase in total cost but you see that as high as 10% or even higher on small projects where basically the contractors don't want to work on it if you want them to pay them enough then they will work on it but for a large projects we haven't seen that. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and just the few clarification. So first of all it sounds like you are not taking that issue yet but then I just want to clarify the numbers if you\u2019re discussing and those are purely labor cost doesn't reflect materials or land rate?","Brian Smith","Yes that's correct. That's just labor and then the materials I mean if you look at cement, concrete, that's pretty much like I said 3% -4%, precast is 2% to 3% glass is stable, the only material were we are seeing \u2013 we\u2019ve been given notice that you can start to see increases would be on steel and this was about three months ago they said they expect 10% increase in steel prices. But overall material prices are pretty benign.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Appreciate that and then Lisa for you, sorry if I missed this but a clarification on the partial notes redemption. The $100 million I guess redeem next month. Just curious want to make sure that one these costs are baked into the current guidance and then also any current \u2013 any update on current thinking on the remaining $300 million of note that will be outstanding pro forma?","Lisa Palmer","First yes, the make all is in our existing guidance and we will \u2013 it would be, there have to be some unusual reason why we would not just let the notes go to maturity and then refinance them at that time because I will remind that you that we have a forward starting swap in place for $250 million of that issuance so at a minimum we certainly expect to refinance at least $250 million.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you. ","Hap Stein","Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. ","A - Hap Stein","We appreciate your time. And want you to have a great remainder of the week. Great Halloween and great weekend.

Welcome to Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the conference over to Laura Clark. Ms. Clark, you may now begin.","Laura Clark","Good morning and welcome to Regency's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.","On today's call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.","Before turning the call over to Hap, I want to mention our upcoming Raleigh market showcase event in early October. This event will feature our high quality properties including recent developments, redevelopment and acquisitions as well as our local market team. We hope that many of you will be able to join us, and I'm happy to provide more details to those of you who would like to attend. Hap?","Hap Stein","Thanks Laura. Good morning everyone. Before discussing our results and outlook for the remainder of the year and for the future, I'd like to highlight that executive changes we announced yesterday.","I'm extremely excited that Lisa Palmer will become President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 1st, 2020, and at that time, I will transition to Executive Chairman.","On August 12th, Mike Mas will become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Jim Thompson and Mac Chandler will be appointed Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer to better recognize their roles within the company. This succession is the result of a well-considered plan that Regency has been crafting for the last several years and we have no hesitation that this transition will be seamless.","I'm deeply gratified to work with the best professionals in the business. Regency's people are the cornerstone of the company and our values and may have worked together to build a truly wonderful company.","Lisa is the embodiment of Regency's culture and success. Over the last several years, Lisa and I have been partners in the direction of Regency, making decisions together every step of the way through Regency's vision, strategy, and consistent execution. And it's through this partnership I know that our understanding of the business, our ability to execute on our strategy, our experience in the capital markets as well as our devotion to our special culture position her to continue to build on Regency's past success.","And with the support of the executive team and of our people, we'll continue our focus on being the preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of shopping centers.","Now to the quarter, Lisa, Jim, Mac, and Mike will discuss in more detail how we're operating in and in our view is a recently favorable environment which is reflected in the underlying fundamentals. This includes a portfolio that is over 95% leased, net growth in high single-digits and bad debt at prior year's healthy levels.","That said, the delayed timing of new leasing in the first half of the year as well as not exceeding our assumptions for move-outs resulted in a decline in rent paying occupancy. This has impacted the second quarter as well as the back half of the year. As a result, we now expect to finish towards the lower end of our same-property NOI growth range, which doesn't meet our high expectations.","However, in spite of moderately lower NOI growth in 2019, this year, we continue to generate substantial free cash flow translating into meaningful growth in core earnings and AFFO.","Most important of all, I'm confident in our unequaled combination of strategic advantages including the quality of our portfolio, our development capabilities, the strength of our balance sheet and our high -- highly engaged team has and will continue to position Regency to be a leader in the shopping center sector and generate total returns of 8% to 10%.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Regency's future Chief Executive Officer, Lisa Palmer.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank Hap and the Board for this tremendous opportunity. We are truly fortunate to have had such an impactful leader of our company and for our employees.","Hap and our senior leadership team with the guidance of an exceptional Board -- in the company for a seamless transition. As Hap said, we've worked so closely together along with Mike, Jim and Mac, and our entire team is ready and excited to continue to build on Regency's past success and move the company forward as we realize our vision and achieve our key objectives.","Moving to the quarter, I'd like to highlight a few things as our team continued to execute on our strategy. Our high quality portfolio remains at a healthy 95% leased and our leasing pipeline is deep. We started exciting new development and redevelopment projects including Culver City market in the, which Mac will talk about in just felt a bit.","We further enhanced the quality of our portfolio through the acquisition of a premier shopping centers in Silicon Valley, and with our balance sheet strength, we are able to fund the acquisition on an essentially non-dilutive leverage neutral basis.","Our conservative balance sheet at approximately $170 million of free cash flow, which is after capitals and dividends, continue to provide substantial financial flexibility and access to capital through future cycles.","We recently published our annual Corporate Responsibility Report which highlights our commitment to our people, our communities, our best-in-class ethics and corporate governance and environmental stewardship. And importantly, we now expect core operating earnings to grow 3% to 4% for the year and AFFO by over 6%.","Our portfolio continues to benefit from the successful retailers that are expanding their physical presence. Our high volume grocers are driving substantial foot traffic as brick-and-mortar locations remain a critical component to their strategy and at the center of their success.","These best-in-class grocers are attracting desirable shop retailers and restaurants as they continue to commit resources to customer service, the store experience, value, and technology initiatives.","And in spite of the well-publicized headwinds from the retail sector, we remain confident that our high quality portfolio will outperform over the long term and meet our strategic objective to average same-property NOI growth of 3%, which is supported by organic growth as well as positive contributions from our attractive pipeline of redevelopment opportunities. The continued execution of our proven strategy has positioned Regency extremely well to achieve these objectives.","Mac? Sorry. I'm going hand it over to Jim.","Jim Thompson","Thanks Lisa. Same-property NOI growth in the first half of the year of 2.1% was supported by base rent growth, of 2.5%. The quality, appearance and location of our properties as well as our Fresh Look merchandising continued to elicit good demand. This is evidenced by new and renewal leasing volume in the first half of this year which exceeded the first half in 2018.","Move-outs and bad debt that remained near prior year levels are both indicative of a healthy tenant base. We are astutely managing our leasing capitals and achieving high single-digit leasing spreads and executing on embedded rent increases, both of which are contributing to straight line rent growth of 16% for the trailing four quarters.","That said, relevant retailers as well as Regency continue to be diligent and deliberate in lease negotiations as well as site and merchandising selection, which contributed to delays and lease timing in the first half of the year.","In addition, timing associated with permitting and the construction process in markets where the retail environment is striving continue to cause delays. We're also executing on our proactive asset management to fortify our merchandising mix as well as our same-property NOI growth over the long-term. I'd like to share a few notable examples that occurred this quarter.","At our Riverside Square Center in Chicago, we proactively captured a space from a regional gym operator and upgraded that merchandising with Blink Fitness, a premium quality, value-based fitness concept that is a subsidiary of Equinox. Blink took a total of 15,000 square feet at a rent that was over 20% accretive to the former operator.","Also in Sheridan Plaza in South Florida, we declined Bed, Bath & Beyond's request to renew and reduce rent. We captured that space and are executing on a new lease with Burlington at 130% rent spread. These examples as well as many others demonstrate that we are being thoughtful and making the right long-term decisions even when resulting in downtime.","In regards to potential future bankruptcy filings and store rationalization, we are diligently monitoring launch list retailers. Our local teams have been actively marketing many of these spaces, and given the desirability of our real estate, there are a number of backfill prospects we're working with. Should we get these spaces back, we expect to upgrade the merchandising often at higher rents.","The recent news around the potential for Barney's to file bankruptcy was new information and there's much uncertainty around the eventual outcome. Importantly, despite their corporate struggles, we feel good about the long-term prospects of this unique location in Chelsea.","All that said, while the bankruptcies and store closures continue to dominate the headlines, expanding categories like off-price, fitness, restaurants, entertainment, and grocery users are making up for these closures and presenting merchandising upgrades and redevelopment opportunities, leaving us feeling good about the state of our business. Mac? ","Mac Chandler","Thanks Jim. Our capital allocation strategy, which clearly differentiates Regency's business model starts with $170 million of annual free cash flow after capitals and dividends. This enables us to fully self-fund our development and redevelopment objective, start and deliver $1.25 billion over five years on an extremely favorable and cost-effective basis.","In the second quarter, we started our terrific ground-up development in Culver City, arguably the most sought-after market in Southern California. This dense and build project will be anchored by Urbanspace, one of the leading market hall operators as well as several local restaurants and retailers. The area of Culver marketplace is extremely compelling, with more than 275,000 people with average household incomes of over $125,000.","We also started four redevelopments this quarter, the largest being our mixed use project in Cambridge, known as The Abbott. We're extremely excited about this exceptional opportunity and its value creation. The Abbott is the most prominent location in Harvard Square, benefits from tremendous foot traffic and world-class demographics.","Our in-process developments and redevelopments are performing well. The projects are nearly 90% leased and committed with the expected yields that remain comfortably well above cap rates for comparable Class A properties.","Our in-process redevelopments as well as select future redevelopment opportunities are on track to contribute over $40 million of incremental NOI. One such example is our Westwood Shopping Center in Bethesda. Now, that we have secured our entitlements, we continue to advance our plans and look forward to discussing more details later this year.","As we've previously communicated, a key component of our investment strategy is portfolio quality enhancement through the acquisition of premier assets. On July 1st, we did just this with our acquisition of The Pruneyard, a 258,000 square foot center in the heart of Silicon Valley. This iconic center anchored by Trader Joe's and Marshalls sits in close proximity to the West Valley's most affluent neighborhoods and technology employers and is merchandize to superb local retailers and restaurants.","Adjacent to The Pruneyard are three office towers and a hotel, which were not part of transaction, but do contribute to our significant foot traffic. The Pruneyard is expected to generate a 3.5% NOI CAGR and an IRR in excess of 6.5%. This is yet another example of a strategic acquisition that serves to fortify our NOI growth.","Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we plan to fund the transaction will lower growth dispositions combined with debt in an unsecured market, both of which are reflected in our guidance upgrades. Mike? ","Mike Mas","Thank you, Mac. I'd like to provide some color on our reaffirmed same-property NOI growth and updated earnings guidance. First, we are maintaining our initial 2019 same-property NOI growth guidance range of 2% to 2.5%, which is centered around varying degrees of new renewal and move-out activity.","As we've discussed this morning, net leasing activity that occurred over the first half of the year and, more importantly, the timing of that activity has led to our current expectation for same-property NOI growth to end the year closer to the lower end of this range.","And for added clarity, please also note that our reaffirmed range does not incorporate any potential loss from Barney's as that situation remains very fluid. And as Jim mentioned, there is much uncertainty around the eventual outcome. Our annual rent exposure to Barney's is approximately $4.9 million, same-property NOI growth could be impacted by up to a maximum of 25 basis points this year.","As we have previously communicated, coming into this year, our 2019 same-property NOI growth range falls below our 3% strategic objective, primarily due to the long-awaited Sears bankruptcy, together with the muted contribution from redevelopment deliveries.","However, as we consider the high quality of our portfolio and look forward to the visible redevelopment opportunities in our pipeline, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our objective to average same-property growth of 3% over the next five years.","Turning to FFO, the Barney's credit situation resulted in an unexpected non-cash expense of approximately $0.02 per share from the reserve of the tenant's straight line receivable. This non-cash charge will be offset by a number of other positive impacts for the full year including more favorable G&A and a slight push in timing of our planned disposition, which in total allowed us to tighten our efforts while keeping the midpoint constant at $3.83 per share.","As a reminder, we like to use core operating earnings as a better metric to measure performance for Regency as it eliminates certain non-recurring and non-cash items and more closely reflects cash earnings and our ability to grow the dividend.","In the second quarter, we grew core operating earnings by 4.6% after adjusting for the lease accounting change. And given the positive impacts of lower G&A and new disposition timing, we now expect to grow core operating earnings per share for the full year by 3% to 4%. You may recall that this range was wider with the floor of 2% when we initially offered guidance.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Christine McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Christine Tulloch","Hey, good morning everyone. Just first Michael and Katie, and I just wanted to offer our congratulations to Lisa and the rest of the team. Obviously, part of the longer term plan, but well deserved. And Hap, we'll definitely miss you in the fray, but we know you'll still be around.","Just to follow-up, Mike, on some of the Barney's stuff. I know it's not in the same-store range yet for 2019, but does this potentially derail -- I know it's only 30 basis points, but you have a plan to sort of get back to that 3% same-store NOI growth rate by 2020. Does that -- does this and sort of the timing issues in 2019 potentially impact that?","And with regard to that specific store, it's not a normal holding for you. I know the focus for them has been more on their Midtown store rent, but how would you feel about having to re-lease that space versus where that market is today?","Mike Mas","Thank you, Christine. I appreciate the question. I'll leave the re-tenanting to Jim, but let me first address your question around our NOI growth, and I think what you're asking the future profile.","I'm not going to give 2020 guidance at this point in time. We're just not prepared for that. But I would say that, listen, Barney's, Sears, Toys before that, this is part of the business. Always have been. We're going to have retailers who fail and we'll continue to have retailers who fail. This is a large rent for us and a 0.25 point impact for this year and under a lot of assumptions, maybe 0.25 point next year as well.","That being said, it's just two to -- it's a 2.25, 2.5 business organically, again assuming that we're going to have tenant fallout. Again the real reason we're at these levels this year is the lack of and the muted contribution from redevelopment deliveries, and we've been very vocal and have communicated with them in the past. The exciting part is we see redevelopment pipeline continue to make progress, and Mac and I have color on that.","You saw us start The Abbot. You saw us -- we're making great progress on Westwood. Market common is underway. All of these are why we believe our future NOI very clear that our five year average from this point forward will be back in that 3% range, which is consistent with our objective.","With respect to Barney's, I'll let Jim comment on the re-leasing.","Jim Thompson","Chris, you're right. It is a bit of a -- property for our portfolio. But ever since the merger, we felt that, that underlying real estate and Chelsea address had really long-term potential for future opportunity. Let's back up a little bit, but in fact, we had unsolicited offers to buy that asset in the past. Trader continues to improve.","And at the end of the day, yes, we think there is value at play should we get the real estate back. Obviously, there's tremendous amount of uncertainty as to what will happen during this discussion of bankruptcy, but our team is evaluating options as we speak. So, more to come as we learn more.","Christine Tulloch","Okay. Thanks. And then understanding you've raised your disposition expectation to help fund -- but do you have anything under contract for sale today? Sorry if I missed that, Mac, in your comments. And was the downward revision to the distribution cap rate a function of the mix and what you're selling or sort of better execution for what you expected?","Mac Chandler","Thanks Christy. Nothing under contract, although we're negotiating three different purchase contracts to identify the buyer. And then we have three other properties that we've taken out to the market, so they're virtually on The Street. So, initial interest on those -- we feel good about it.","And then the reason we've lowered our cap rate on the disposition is we've gotten a little bit better pricing than we expected. And if you look at what we sold today, keep in mind, too, we've had -- about a third of those assets are Louisiana properties that sold for roughly 10 caps. So, if we average that in there, gives you a good indication of the quality of our properties and the pricing that we've been able to realize.","Christine Tulloch","Thanks so much.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Christy and appreciate your nice comments, greatly appreciate.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, good morning and congrats on all the appointees. I'll echo Christy's comment there. You mentioned.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you before Hap had the chance to jump me. So, thanks, Jeremy, thank you.","Jeremy Metz","So, in the opening remarks you mentioned the lowering of the same-store NOI range is the delay in timing for some rent payments. I'm just wondering any more color you can give on that in terms of what you're driving some of that relative to the expectation.","And you did mention the permitting and the construction delays, but I don't really think that's necessarily new. We heard about this process strategy last year, so I would assume some of that was built on the expectations. But any more color on that?","Hap Stein","Let me start, and again, we'll clean up on here in a little bit. Again, I appreciate you bringing it up. So, we are focused and our team's eyes are pointing towards the lower end of the range right now. And it's really due primarily to the timing of our net leasing activity that we experienced over the first six months.","So, the way I'd like to describe it in other words is we're expecting our average rent paying occupancy to be a little bit lower for a little bit longer this year, and that is lower than what we had hoped for. However, it is more consistent with the assumption that we had in place supporting the lower end of our range. So, now the question is we look at the year.","Importantly, we remain very comfortable with the assumptions on both ends at this point in time, although our eyes are pointing toward the bottom. At this point in time of the year, it's more about move-outs assumptions obviously. And with respect to that, more positive results on that front as well as net increase in timing of our expenses what you give us to outperform. So we'll focus on that.","But again, it's really timing, tenant demand is healthy, and Jim will speak to that. Volumes have been very good. They're roughly in line with our expectations and they're roughly in line with prior years.","Jim Thompson","Yes, Jeremy, I'll just piggyback a little bit on that. The volumes have been strong. Pipeline is solid. When you look at our shops, we're at 91.5% on the small shops space today. We consistently been in the 91% to 93% range, which has been quite frankly at or near at the top of our sector.","So, we're still optimistic and bullish on the tenant demand. We think the continued execution of our redevelopment, remerchandising opportunities and efforts will continue to keep this in that 91% to 93% range. And personally, I'm bullish that we can move towards the higher end of that range as we execute on these redevelopments and remerchandising.","Jeremy Metz","Helpful. Thanks. And then second for me just in terms of The Pruneyard acquisition, should we think about this just more as a stabilized type of acquisition, or is there any value-add or notable upside potential there that you can be sitting on? And just sticking with aiding further in the pipeline on the acquisition, you can maybe can get to the goal line here.","Mac Chandler","Sure Jeremy this is Mac. I think in the short-term, you can expect this to be, as we've discussed, various property with great CAGR at 3.5%. 10-year CAGR is going to pick up kind of quickly because there's about five tenants are in buildout that haven't commenced rent that should happen over the next nine months.","Further out, maybe 10 -- more than 10 years out, there's a couple of other boxes that will roll the market and there could be some really interesting opportunities here, the sports basement box, sets itself up. You can do a lot of different things with that. Don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but it is one of the reasons we'd like the property long-term, there's tremendous demand for office, multifamily, just the kind of demand that we look for.","As to other acquisitions, we already guided and we're getting really close on. There are couple of properties that were looking at, that are acquisitions that would have a redevelopment focus and we really prefer those properties that use our team, our platform, and our capital, and those two midsized projects that hopefully we can give you a little bit more color on next quarter.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks. Appreciate.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Hill","Hey good morning guys. Lisa or Mike, I want to come back to The Pruneyard and think about how much of the benefited was to FFO. Recognize you kept the FFO guide consistent at a tighter range despite the $0.02 onetime non-cash in straight-line rent charge. So, that mean we should think about The Pruneyard as maybe a $0.02 benefit that offset that? ","Lisa Palmer","Now, Rich, in my prepared remarks I think I commented that we're doing this essentially on a non-dilutive -- although I didn't say pretty good but essentially earnings neutral. It was the fact that going in cap rates in the mid-4s and we're going to be funding that partially with disposition and we're seeing our disposition guidance we're able to offset the cost of that this position as well as the cost debt. So, it's essentially earnings neutral.","If you just remind everyone just strategically why these acquisitions make sense, it's an important part of our capital allocation strategy to continue to fortify that NOI growth to acquire premier assets. And we've talked about it in the past. It's no accident that we've been able to maintain and lead our sector with above same-property NOI growth.","And we think the continued enhancement of the quality of the portfolio -- we don't need to, but we're very opportunistic in doing so, I think that's an important part of our strategy.","Richard Hill","That makes perfect sense. Thanks guys.","Mike Mas","Real quick on FFO. The offset to a non-cash charge was, as we indicated in the call, better G&A expectations as well as a slight timing enhancement to our dispositions.","Richard Hill","Got it. Okay, that's all from me. And congrats to everyone on the call as well.","Hap Stein","Thanks Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Schmidt","Yes. Also I'd like to jump on and give congratulations to all those promoted in the executive leadership change, and it's great to see talent developed within the company. So, again, congratulations.","I wondered if we could discuss just a little bit the allocation of capital of redevelopments versus acquisitions and maybe talk about what was more compelling reason to buy The Pruneyard, was it the asset quality or its upside opportunity.","Hap Stein","I think that the number one use of our capital, $170 million of free cash flow, is to fund our development and redevelopment program. And the majority of those investments today are redevelopments.","And then I would say in the second priority becomes value-add acquisitions like Mac implied that we're looking at right know when there's a meaningful upside. And in the third category will be core acquisitions -- high quality acquisitions with superior growth prospects like The Pruneyard and 3.5% project NOI growth plus a potential upside beyond that.","And we're funding those through the sale of assets. And as Lisa mentioned, given our right now and we think we can do it on essentially on earnings and balance sheet neutral basis with superior NOI growth going forward and\/or value add opportunities going forward.","Craig Schmidt","Great. Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Samir Khanal","Good morning everyone. So, just switching gears a little bit on grocers. I know just curious to get your views on Albertsons. It sounds like they're starting to move in the right direction. They're addressing leverage. Curious as to see what you're seeing on the ground again the exposure they have.","Lisa Palmer","I'll take that one, Samir. Just for the past couple of years really, three years potentially, even we've seen continual improvement in the actual store operations of Albertsons, better sales sometimes anecdotally they're reporting, but generally better operations.","And as they went through some management changes, and we know their management pretty well, especially their last CEO, and under that very short period of time, right after that kind of failed RiteAid merger, they really pivoted on improving the balance sheet as well and they made tremendous improvements in their balance sheet and further improvements in their operations and even their margins.","If you were to go read some research reports, you'll see that Albertsons actually has some of the healthiest EBITDA margins in the sector. So, that's Albertsons and that's how -- so we're comfortable with the direction in which they are headed.","But even more importantly, the quality, we really like our real estate and the quality of the grocers, the individual stores of Albertsons that we have in our centers are above average, and the real estate itself is well above average. So, we like our position with Albertsons, but we do recognize the potential risks of that.","Samir Khanal","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Hawthorne","Hi. I equity wanted to mention the big uplift from anchor expirations. How much of that is left to go?","Hap Stein","We appreciate the question, Brian, and if you recall from our last Investor Day, we started what we call the legacy leases, and those are a combination of both legacy portfolios of anchor leases that are coming due.","A lot of that remains and that all will be supported by this five-year plan that we feel good about and our ability to generate organic NOI growth in that 2.25% and 2.5% range and we're supplementing that with redevelopment opportunities. Some of those legacy leases are what triggered these redevelopment opportunities.","Brian Hawthorne","Okay. And then on -- it seems like 90% leased. When do those tenants start paying the rent? And I guess when do you get to that kind of stabilized yield? Or when do you expect to get there?","Mac Chandler","Sure, Brian. This is Mac. Roughly 93% lease was committed and with last quarter, we leased more than 35,000 square feet including the -- was really one of our last sort of pivotal stations.","Most of the tenants are open, operating, doing well, reporting sales in excess of the projections. So, I think by year-end, we should be stabilized lease spaces. If you get a chance, we encourage you to get out there and take a look at it. It's doing well and we're very pleased with that.","Hap Stein","The center looks fabulous. And not only the place you mentioned there, but also the merchandising is exceptional.","Brian Hawthorne","When you say by year-end reached a stabilized yield, that means like by December? Or do you mean by fourth quarter, you'll be at the 6.8 yield? I think that's what it was.","Mac Chandler","Well, difference between December and the fourth quarter is pretty finite. I would just assume by year end at this point.","Brian Hawthorne","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","The next questions from the line of Vince Tibone with Greenstreet. Please proceed with your question.","Vince Tibone","First off, congratulations from me as well. My first question is how do you think about your cost of capital today? Based on guidance changes, it appears you prefer dispositions over assumed equity to fund acquisitions. I'm curious is there like a certain stock price for you to assume equity to fund external growth?","Hap Stein","Well, number one, as we've said before, we start with $170 million of free cash flow after dividends, after CapEx and the number one priority of that is to fund developments and redevelopments.","And then beyond that, you look at how we can make a trade, whether it's -- we're selling property to buy back stock that we've done in the past or selling property to fund acquisitions as we are doing with The Pruneyard, sometimes using debt. And at times in the past when we thought when the trade made sense, we issued equity.","Vince Tibone","Got it. That makes sense. My next is kind of your acquisition strategy going forward. Do you think Regency could buy more large ticket items? There seemed to be significantly fewer potential buyers, let's say $100-plus million centers versus small dollar centers?","And then I was just curious, are there any markets or regions that you think are particularly attractive today and you're actively looking to increase our exposure?","Lisa Palmer","I'll -- color on the markets. But I'll just reiterate what Hap said in terms of the use of our capital and the fact that we are -- we're opportunistic. And then to the extent that we're able to identify and have the ability to acquire shopping centers with a value-add component or with above-average growth and we're able to fund it on an essentially leverage-neutral basis and then earnings-efficient basis, we'll continue to do that.","We think it's an important part of our strategy. But I'd also reiterate we don't need to. When we talk about our organic business model, it's same-property NOI growth, it's our development and redevelopment that are funded by the $170 million of free cash flow and it's the strength of our balance sheet and our talented team. Acquisitions are generally additive to that.","Hap Stein","Yes, I don't -- we are always in the market looking for the most compelling opportunities. You can see what we bought in the past and we've been buying in the coast. We bought a great center in Florida a number of years ago. We bought a great center in Raleigh.","So, it's dependent on also the dynamics of the market, the intersection, the demographics and the health of the tenants. We look at carefully the rent load as compared to centers. So, could we buy another large acquisition again? I would say it just depends, but it would have to be compelling. We look for those factors that we discussed.","Vince Tibone","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","The next question's from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Mueller","Thanks. And obviously congratulations from our whole team here as well. So I guess first for The Pruneyard higher same-store NOI growth CAGR. Can you tell a little bit about what the mark to market is? Or is it coming from outsized comps, the combination of it? And are the bumps comparable to your portfolio or even above those levels?","Hap Stein","Sure Michael. Much of the growth in there is due to embedded rent steps, and the tenants -- at least that we're inheriting the strong bumps have been better than what we have been able to get typical of our overall portfolio. But it's not surprising given the strength of the center of the strength of the market and the demographics.","So tenants signed up for higher bumps because they expect to fully realize higher profits over time given tremendous trade areas. So, there's a little bit of -- a little bit of mark to market there is in every center. But there isn't, for example, one big box that's coming back in year six that's driving the model. It's not one of those situations, it's very much lease-to-lease.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay. And I know the watch list was brought up earlier. What portion of your ABR does the current watch list make up in aggregate?","Hap Stein","It's a good question. I'll give you a longish answer. We use a pretty extensive watch list internally and we like to beef it up. We like the teams to be aware of where we see issues, which can be financial. So that's more than the traditional bankruptcy risk that you see. That list frankly, has absent Barney's, we've put them aside, has actually shrunk over time really from Sears and actual real-life bankruptcies occurring.","The second part of it was we use just store closures, store rationalization list, and this is where we'll include concepts that we feel may be oversaturated. Importantly, in that environment, Regency historically performs better. We find when fleets are rationalized, it is very often that their locations within our centers are higher performers, upper tier, upper half of their portfolios, and we just do better in that regard.","And then lastly, we'd like to include -- otherwise healthy financial risk -- financial tenants that for whatever reason are maybe stub their toe and a good example of that will be Chipotle in the past with the food quality issue that they came across.","So, we do include them on our internal list. The percent of our overall rent has been -- it's well under 2%. We're probably in that 1.5% range, and that's really across those three categories, Mike. So, it's pretty broad.","Michael Mueller","Okay, that was it. Thank you.","Michael Mueller","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Tsai","Hi, let me add my congratulations to everyone. Lisa and Mike, you guys make a great team. I know Sears had a 40 basis point impact on the same-property in the quarter. What kind of impact do you expect on 3Q and 4Q and maybe just shed some update on the re-leasing of those boxes?","Hap Stein","Sure. Let me take the impact question and Jim will handle the re-leasing. We're expecting all bankruptcies included in the second half of the year, it's in that 30 basis point range as an impact on the same-property NOI growth primarily to base rent.","Jim Thompson","I'm going to start our [Indiscernible] center which are our largest use is. That's a very good center that we own there. And it's in part -- it's in Austin, terrific market, just north of the city. It's also anchored by H-E-B that's over $100 million in sales. So, it's got great tenant performance and great foot traffic.","The existing box has great bones, great structural integrity, great ceiling heights, great column layouts, and it really sets it up well for an adaptive reuse. So, we've been studying these plans. We haven't picked a definitive angle that we're doing. But obviously, the likely approach is we're going to convert into accretive offers, a strong demand for tenants looking for space just like that.","It can take a little bit of time, but because we've been using the existing box, it doesn\u2019t take discretionary entitlements. So, more to come on that one. But I would say we'll be able to start that construction next year and deliver to tenants about 12 months following the commencement of construction.","Hap Stein","The last Kmart we have is in Gainesville, Florida and we are at LRI, with the market-leading grocer for that particular box, and I would suspect that we will have a little more clarity in the next six months on the direction of that and probably an 18 to 24 months of deliverable.","Linda Tsai","Thanks. And then maybe just addressing the comment that retailers that are closing stores, but it tends to happens less at Regency given your higher quality centers. In terms of Dress Barn and GNC, how much exposure do you have there? And how do you feel about those rent versus market?","Hap Stein","Our exposure for Dress Barn, we only have eight locations and it's about 10 basis points, Linda. And then GNC it was in the 20 basis point range. Jim can comment further. This is kind of regular way business for us, but we feel really good about the retaining opportunities.","Jim Thompson","Yes, there's nothing new there. We're happy to have spreads back. We've been watching obviously both of them for a while. And we really -- like I said, we think we've got an opportunity to upgrade our merchandising at the end of the day.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Linda.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I will turn the floor back to Hap Stein for closing remarks.","Hap Stein","Once again, we thank every one of you for your interest in Regency and give me one more call and I look forward to that, and we really enjoyed the relationships with our investment communities. It's been special. We've had -- feel good work with a good team. It's been extremely successful. More often than not, the story is easy to tell. So, I thank you all very much, and everybody have a great weekend. Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Clark","Good morning, and welcome to Regency's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.","On today's call, we may discuss forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.","Before turning the call over to Hap, I want to touch on the earnings and accounting disclosure changes effective this quarter. These include updates to NAREIT FFO and the treatment of gains on sale and impairments of land, as well as accounting changes from the adoption of the new leasing standard, and are summarized in our earnings release and quarterly supplemental. We hope that these details will facilitate this accounting and reporting transition.","Hap?","Hap Stein","Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone.","As you'll hear from Jim, Mac and Lisa, we feel good about this quarter's performance, operating fundamentals and the outlook for the business. We remain confident that Regency is extremely well positioned to successfully navigate threats and prosper from opportunities, by intentionally managing and leasing our high-quality portfolio and executing on our value-add development and redevelopment program, and self-funding capital allocation strategy, all while maintaining our strong and conservative balance sheet.","Before turning it over to Jim, I'd like to touch on why we really like having grocers at 80% of our centers. This begins with the fact that the grocers in our portfolio include the top operators in the country and are producing sales that average $650 per square foot and benefit from low occupancy cost.","At the same time, the grocery business has always been highly competitive and is evolving at an even more accelerated pace. Still having a physical store located close to the customer in the best centers, has and remains the centerpiece of their business model.","Importantly, it is the store that provides the best opportunity for the grocer to win the customer through a compelling combination of service, experience and value. Several examples include Publix's impressive top and bottom line growth, results from the focus on paramount importance of their employees who are critical to creating a pleasant shopping experience. Opening new stores and renovating existing ones remains a critical component of this strategy. It is also worth noting that Publix continues to be one of the top buyers of shopping centers.","Kroger has a heightened focus on integrating technology and strategic partnerships to better service their existing customers and create new ones. Their ClickList, Restock Kroger and alliances with Ocado and Walgreens are among the more notable initiatives. Grocers like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Sprout's, HEB and Wegmans achieve extremely high levels of in-store sales, as a result of the compelling and often unique shopping experiences. And each is expanding their store base with no change to the size of the store footprints.","Albertsons\/Safeway is investing well over $1 billion annually in the core business. They're likewise focused on the customer experience, including re-merchandising with more organic and gourmet offerings, as well as using technology to support multi-channel customer satisfaction. Importantly, Albertsons again, experienced improved financial performance in 2018, with consecutive sales and EBITDA growth, better margins and a $1.5 billion reduction in debt.","Furthermore, Regency's Albertsons locations are in highly desirable trade areas, where the center benefits from its competitive position. The majority are in West Coast markets where the Albertsons\/Safeway banner is the market leader. The bottom line is that our grocery anchors are proven operators that are evolving for their customers and generating significant daily traffic to our centers, including the added convenience of buy online, pickup in store.","Jim?","Jim Thompson","Thanks Hap.","Performance in operating fundamentals were solid in the first quarter with nearly 3% NOI growth in the same property portfolio, driven entirely by base rent. Our tenants are healthy, demonstrated by historically high collection rates, which translates into very low bad debt. Rent growth is stabilized in the high single-digits, and we continue to have a lot of success incorporating mid-term rent steps into our leases, which is a key component of our strategic objective to average 3% same property NOI growth.","Our same property portfolio still sits at a strong 95% leased. The sequential decline this quarter was primarily due by the closure of two Sears locations, but we are very excited about the redevelopment opportunities to upgrade the merchandising mix and overall appeal of the centers.","Our shop space is 91.5% leased, which I want to note is among the highest in the sector. This quarter, shop occupancy was impacted by a couple of things. First, an expected seasonal trend of slightly higher move-outs as is typical in the first quarter. Second, lease execution timing is taking longer as tenants remain discerning and deliberate in their leasing decisions.","And lastly, we continue to execute on our proactive asset management and center repositioning, which includes recapture shop space in conjunction with our redevelopment assets, which is causing a negative impact of 50 basis points to our shop space percent leased this quarter. And we continue to take an aggressive approach to upgrade the quality of the merchandising, especially at those properties acquired in the merger.","All that said, many successful local, regional and national retailers continue to look for new locations in high-quality centers and the depth and velocity of our leasing pipeline remains healthy. We feel good about the level of tenant interest, where we are seeing demand across all regions within expanding REIT categories like off-price, fitness, restaurants, entertainment and grocery users for both anchor and side shop spaces. We believe tenants are making thoughtful business decisions as they commit to opening new stores.","Looking forward, we believe as the year progresses, occupancy will increase as our team executes on our redevelopments and re-anchoring opportunities, supported by this robust pipeline of tenant interest.","Mac?","Mac Chandler","Thanks Jim.","We had another successful quarter executing on our capital allocation strategy. This starts with the $170 million of annual free cash flow after capital and dividends, enabling us to fully fund our development and redevelopments on extremely favorable cost-effective basis.","This clearly differentiates Regency's business model. The inherent quality of our portfolio and the free cash flow, allows us to be selective with capital recycling as we identify compelling investment opportunities that can be executed on a basis that are tax efficient and mitigates adverse impacts to earnings.","In the first quarter, we sold seven shopping centers for a total of $137 million. As we previously communicated, this sales activity funded prior-year share repurchases, as well as investments in the high-growth premier acquisitions. A prime example is Melrose Market, an exceptional center near downtown Seattle acquired in the first quarter with excellent growth prospects.","Also during the quarter, we acquired an additional interest in Town and Country Los Angeles. Our total interest is now approximately 20% and we have the opportunity to increase this to 35% and possibly even more. We cannot be more excited about the value creation opportunities for this shopping center, anchored by Whole Foods and CVS, and located across from one of the top-performing malls in the country, The Grove.","Redevelopment of this asset, which is expected to start in late 2020 or early '21, will include 80,000 square feet of new retail in place of the former K-Mart box, plus 325 mid-rise apartments to be developed by Holland Partners on a 99-year ground lease. The vibrancy, tenancy and density of this site is an incredibly attractive addition to our portfolio.","This quarter, to provide more visibility into these types of future opportunities, we've added new supplemental disclosure regarding select operating properties with near-term redevelopment opportunities. This includes the Abbot in Cambridge, which started subsequent to quarter-end; Westwood in Bethesda; and Costa Verde in San Diego. We hope this new disclosure provides more transparency into the depth of our pipeline and the incremental value that will be generated as we execute our plan.","Our developments and redevelopments are performing well at nearly 90% leased with strong leasing momentum and yielding a blended 7.5% return and margins that remain well above cap rates for comparable high-quality shopping centers. On top of our in-process projects, we have a pipeline of future development and redevelopment opportunities that should enable us to meet our objective at $1.25 billion in starts and deliveries over the next five years and create significant value.","Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Mac and good morning, everyone.","2019 is off to another good start with first quarter results in line with our expectations. I'd like to begin with additional color around our same property NOI and earnings guidance. We are maintaining same property NOI guidance in the range of 2% to 2.5%, and while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I think it's important to note that we expect next quarter to come in below 2%, primarily due to the two Sears closures and timing of reconciliations.","As we have previously communicated, our 2019 same property guidance range does fall below our 3% strategic objective due to the closure of these Sears locations, as well as a muted contribution from redevelopment. However, we feel confident in our ability to achieve our 3% objective over the long term.","Turning to earnings, we had two non-recurring items in the first quarter resulting in a negative $0.03 per share impact to NAREIT FFO. The first item was an early redemption charge of $0.06 per share related to the prepayment of our 2021 bonds, following a successful 30-year bond offering executed during the quarter. This offering further enhanced our financial flexibility and increased the duration of our average maturities to over 10 years, while maintaining our weighted average interest rate.","In addition, we incurred a positive non-cash impact of $0.03 per share related to the recognition of below-market rent intangibles for two anchor boxes that we got back during the quarter, where we are upgrading both spaces at a much higher rate. With these two impacts, we have updated our FFO and non-cash guidance accordingly. Excluding these impacts, the midpoint of our FFO guidance is unchanged.","Importantly, in the first quarter, we grew core operating earnings by 3.4%, when adjusted for the lease accounting change and we continue to expect growth for 2019 to be in the 2% to 4% range. As a reminder, core operating earnings eliminate certain non-recurring and non-cash items. We believe this is a better measure of the performance of our business as it more closely reflects cash earnings and our ability to grow the dividend.","Before turning the call over for questions, I would like to reiterate the team's continued execution on our proven strategy through the combination of our strategic advantages. First, our high-quality portfolio and intense asset management combine to position Regency to average same-property NOI growth of 3% over the long term.","Second, our experienced development and redevelopment capabilities will enable us to deliver over $1.25 billion in value-add developments and redevelopments over the next five years. And finally, our blue chip capital structure, which benefits from twin pillars, a conservative and strong balance sheet and the $170 million of free cash flow, supporting a self-funding model and low payout ratio.","This unequal combination of strategic advantages will support our core earnings and dividend growth objectives to average 4% to 6% over the long term, generating total shareholder returns in the 8% to 10% range.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Just with regard to same store NOI, so - it seemed like base rent growth was driving much of that overall same store growth in Q1. Just with occupancy down year-over-year outside of the usual contractual rent growth, could you maybe just sort of walk us through the main drivers of that base rent growth and how you see that trending through the balance of the year?","Lisa Palmer","This is Lisa. We still - the model that we always share really, and - that was also as part of our initial earnings guidance maybe during the year, is still an accurate reflection of that. So 1.3% growth will come from contractual rent steps. And that is obviously in that base rent line item. Then you have another piece of that coming from rent spreads.","And so that's been in the high single-digits. So that will add another, call it, 100 basis points. So that gets you to the 2.3%. And then the Sears impact, we did get two months of Sears income in the first quarter, so that's actually also in that line item. And then going through the rest of the year, that's going to become more of a drag.","Christy McElroy","Right, okay.","Lisa Palmer","So while we had 2.8% for quarter one, that is actually going to decline through the rest of the year.","Christy McElroy","And then, Jim, I just wanted to follow up on your comment about lease execution timing taking longer. Is this sort of more of the theme of what we've been seeing in recent years, or is this sort of a more recent change that you've observed and if it is more recent, why do you think - what do you think is driving that?","Jim Thompson","Christy, I think it's a continuation of the theme we've talked about. I think as retailers mature, it's actually side-shop retailers, the survivors are various state business people, they're very cautious and deliberate about what they do. And as they make those kind of commitments, they're being very deliberate. So we are seeing more of that time to execution than - it's becoming more apparent I think than maybe we used to see it, but it's been out there.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Just wanted to make sure this wasn't something new. Thank you.","Jim Thompson","It's - yeah, it's not a sea change, but it's kind of - incremental.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rich Hill","Lisa, maybe this is a follow-up question for you on modeling. It looked like two line items that we were focused on, other rental income was maybe a little bit lower than we were expecting on annualized basis and then ground rent expense was maybe a little bit higher than we were expecting. I know these things can be lumpy, but I'm curious that there is - this is just timing related, or there's anything that we should be thinking about going forward.","Lisa Palmer","No, when you - if we think about the full year - for the remainder of - the projections for the remainder of the year, the primary line item that's going to drive same property NOI growth is base rent. And there is going to be timing impacts and reconciliations from other income from all of those other line items. But at the end of the year, when you look at the individual line items, the driver will be base rent.","And as I said to Christy, while its 2.9% on my number, so yes 2.8%. While it's 2.9% growth in the first quarter, we're going to see Sears continue to drag. So Sears was only a 10 basis point impact in the first quarter. That's going to be growing to 40 bips for the full year. And then just as we talked about in the beginning of the year, as we talk about in the beginning of every year, the most uncertain part of our business are unplanned move-outs and they are also immediately impactful.","And you saw from our numbers that we had move-outs in the first quarter, which is very typical, as Jim mentioned from a seasonal perspective. We did not have those burn-ups in the past two years, and so we were able to raise that kind of a low rent after the first quarter, which we're not able to do this year, because we did actually experience those move-outs.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","Just given the higher and earlier pace of dispositions, I'm wondering if the intention is to slow the disposition process for the rest of the year or may you raise the target going forward?","Lisa Palmer","Mac and I are looking at each other. So our argument is who's going to answer it. So I'll take it from a guidance perspective and Mac can add color in terms of the market in general. So just a reminder that the dispositions - these early dispositions are really funding last year's share buyback.","So with regards to - I'll let Mac take it from there. But again, just a reminder that the early dispositions are funding the share buyback and when you look at our guidance, you can see what we're expecting for the remainder of the year. However, we're always potentially going to be opportunistic.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Mac.","Mac Chandler","Yes, I don't have a whole lot to add at that point, but I would say that we have executed in accordance with our expectations. We are meeting our prices, cap rates are stable for these assets and I'd say that the buyer pool is a little bit deeper than maybe we've seen in the last quarter or two. So we feel confident about our ability to meet our plan for the rest of the year.","Craig Schmidt","And then just a follow-up on - I wondered how, the push on contractual rents. I know your rent was around 1.3% and you're targeting 1.5%, but how are the retailers reacting to slightly higher contractual bumps?","Hap Stein","We continue, Craig, to have really, really good success in implementing those embedded steps. I think 90% of our shop space around about 2.5% average. Annual rent step and it's - you combine that with our rent growth of 8.8% and that's kind of - as lease outline, that's kind of key to the bedrock of our sustainable NOI growth.","Craig Schmidt","And I mean, is it the quality of the portfolio that's allowing you to push this or it's just something else?","Hap Stein","I think certainly the quality. And it's just a - I mentioned we fight, we fight hard for in the field and we have continued to have good success in doing that.","Craig Schmidt","Okay.","Jim Thompson","And a big part of the time, issue is that we are selective in leasing to and even though you may be getting pushback from the tenants, we're negotiating hard to achieve the kind of the tenants that we want and the terms that we want.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Samir Khanal","So I guess, Lisa, can you remind us how much cushion you have left to account for unexpected vacancies at this time as part of guidance? I think - correct me if I'm wrong, please, but I think initially it was about 100 basis points of credit loss reserve?","Lisa Palmer","So, fact - I'll give you some of the facts first.","Samir Khanal","Yes.","Lisa Palmer","We have known - the significant known bankruptcies impacting 2019 are Sears and Toys \"R\" Us. And the impact in the first quarter was 30 basis points and the full-year impact is going to be 60 basis points. I don't like to think of cushion, if you will, with regards to bankruptcies. And again, I'll just bring it back to the most uncertain part of the business going forward or the move-outs. We have a great leasing pipeline that we have a lot of visibility to.","We certainly have full visibility to all of the redevelopments that are in process and in managing that really well. What we don't know are the unplanned move-outs. So with that, our guidance of 2% to 2.5% is incorporating, what we believe to be a prudent level of move-outs that's really consistent with prior years.","Samir Khanal","And I guess one for Hap. You've done a great job on the leasing front on the shop space over the last few years, but that's a segment that did have an impact for you and your peers as well, sort of in the last downturn. I guess, how do we think about that segment? If we do go into slow down, let's say in the future, whether it's 24 months or 18 months that sort of time frame, what steps are you taking to minimize the impact as you continue to lease space in that segment?","Hap Stein","Well, I would say a couple of things. Number one, and this has continued to happen, as there's been kind of a self-policing or self rationalization in that. The tenants today that survive the downturn in '08 and '09 are better operators and that's been the continued - continued to be the step of this - the case.","In addition to that, we are much more selective through a fresh-look initiative, through credit analysis and who --trying to get the best local, regional and national operators in there. And we feel very good about our lineup of side shop retailers. So does that mean we're going to be totally immune to the next downturn when it occurs? No, but I think we're much better positioned going into whatever the economic conditions may - that we may face in the future.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Derek Johnston","Given your free cash flow, it does enable a healthy pipeline of redevelopment opportunities. And I believe around $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion has been discussed over the next five years. So the question is, how do you think about your development pipeline versus your redevelopment pipeline in terms of priority with capital spend? And is it more of a win where the municipal entitlement shake out or something else?","Mac Chandler","Derek, this is Mac. We look at both opportunities really equally in many ways. They're different in the sense that a development is a ground-up - a development opportunity comes out of the ground, and it's new income for the very first time. We continue to look for those and with our unique platform, we've been successful at finding these opportunities.","For redevelopment, what we like about them is, they're in locations where we already know the trade area, we know it extremely well and we can time those redevelopments to start when market conditions give us the green light.","So, the returns are pretty similar, these days, but we like both sets of opportunities. I would say one is a priority over the other or agnostic. And our teams are very much engaged to find both types of opportunities, but to us they are investments and they have strong returns whether they're incremental returns in a redevelopment or just straight up returns from the ground-up.","Hap Stein","And like as you mentioned, I think the key thing is as you go through the math, $170 million of free cash flow on a - essentially leverage neutral basis is going to fund $250 million, $300 million of annual development starts and deliveries. And so we're very well positioned to fund those developments and redevelopments, which are very compelling on an extremely favorable basis.","Derek Johnston","Just secondly, are you seeing increased traction and true proof-of-concept at this point from digitally native and multi-channel focused retailers? I mean, are we at the point where we can firmly say this isn't a fad or a beta test and the demand uptake should ramp over the next several years?","Jim Thompson","I'm happy to take that one. I don't think it's a fad. I think you're clearly seeing those tenants who have begun to engage more bricks-and-mortar, who came out of the digital native background and you're seeing it more and more. I guess, the question would be, over time is, what's the depth of their store count, how broad, will they go nationally and how many stores will they do per market.","So that strategy is playing itself out and we'll continue to monitor that. But one advantage of these digital native platforms is, they really know their trade areas well through their data and through their - through their research.","And so they actually have told us in many ways, they have greater reliability on a new store than a traditional bricks-and-mortar store and as a result, often they can pay more rent because of the probability of success. So anyway, we see that happening and the depth of that is, is what's to be determined.","Hap Stein","And I have something else to - just to remind ourselves, everybody on the call, if Amazon paid $40 million plus a door for Whole Foods, we will be part of very successful native digital retailer who is expanding very aggressively from a bricks-and-mortar standpoint. So I think that is happening. And I think that these native digital retailers are finding the importance of physical locations.","Lisa Palmer","And because this is something we talk about so often, I just - I think it's important to remember and note that, one, there is no debate among any of the retailers whether they're digitally native or whether they're bricks-and-mortar native. That'd be - the most profitable way to get their goods to their customers, is to have the customers walk in the store; and two, the new customer acquisition costs are much lower also with bricks-and-mortar than they are just digitally. And they've all acknowledged that and recognized that. And I think their strategies are reflecting that as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Donnelly","Maybe this branches up an earlier question, but concerning grocery and your underwriting process there, I'm just curious how you guys are informing yourself on how that landscape is going to evolve in the coming years and what do you feel are going to be the key points of differentiation? I mean, is it a decision that runs more to the site, is it like real estate than the retailer or is a little more nuance than that?","Hap Stein","The answer to you is, the retailer - the answer is yes. The retailer matters and the site matters. And going back to the site is what you want to have is a location where - if bad news happens and we hope it doesn't, it becomes good news from a merchandising and from replacement standpoint and from a rent standpoint.","Like today, I think the good retailers want to be in the better sites and good retailers, including the better grocers, want to be in the better sites where they're going to generate significant traffic. And I think it's kind of a self-rationalization process. But I think that we want to do - as I indicated, we have and been part of our history and our track record of working and partnering with the best-in-class operators that get, that have strong balance sheets and ability to invest in the business, and in effect, pay the rent that we'd like to get in the better locations.","And you look at, whether it's Whole Foods or Publix or HEB or Kroger, Sprout's, these are all strong retailers that are continuing to evolve. They know how to provide customer experience, they know how to differentiate themselves. And I - all those factors are critically important to us because what we want to do is, if they do it, we got the right - if we have the right retailer and you have the right grocery anchor, then we're going to be able to track the better side shop retailers, which is also critical to our business model.","Jeff Donnelly","And maybe just as a follow-up on that, I mean, do you think it's become clear that a lot of the changes or a lot of the concepts that people are exploring, like bigger format, smaller formats, online order and pickup in store, is that you've seen a better model emerge or is that sort of yet to be determined, do you think?","Hap Stein","So here is what's so interesting, is that Kroger's ideal format is 100,000 square feet, HEB is 110,000 square feet to 120,000 square feet, Publix is in the 50,000 square foot range, Whole Foods range is from 40,000 square feet to 60,000 square feet, Trader Joe's is in the 15,000 foot range.","So it varies and I think they've all been able to, in effect, continue to perfect their model. I think it's an evolutionary process, but what's - one of the more interesting things that we've noted is, their formats have not really shrunk, I mean other than to fit into infill locations. So, I think they've all adopted, they've all got strategies from the formatting standpoint Jeff, that they think makes sense and the proof has been in the pudding with their performance.","Jeff Donnelly","If I could, maybe just a question for you, Lisa. It may be a more conceptual question, I guess on leverage. There's some property sectors out there, not retail, but - that have seen their acceptable levels of leverage shift lower in the last 10 years to 20 years as these companies who are public, the fixed income and equity investors become less tolerant to volatility or severity. Regency clearly has a great balance sheet, but retail has had its challenges and we've seen leverage shift lower.","But it's also happened during a time when the economy has been relatively resilient, we haven't really faced recession. Do you - I guess, how do you think about where leverage could go in the future to the extent we have a recession that adds more pressure. Do you foresee a time where the leverage in retail could actually continue to shift lower than it is today?","Lisa Palmer","First off, we're really comfortable with our balance sheet today. We're not just comfortable, we're really proud of it. We've made significant progress on improving and strengthening the balance sheet, whether it be just with the level of debt that we have and also with the tenure of the debt that we have.","With that said, we've been pretty transparent that our target level of net debt to EBITDA today is 5 times, then we're slightly above that. So we're going to continue to try to drive that down through organic growth and opportunistic actions when they're available to us.","We are always monitoring our capacity levels, our commitments to developments, to acquisitions and we ensure that if we ever were to go into the crisis that we had in 2009 when there was zero access to the capital markets for a period of time, that we can actually survive not just - that was for about four months, we could actually for an excess of a year.","So we're going to continue to maintain that and really focus on that. At the same time, I don't like to think of it as pressure in a recession, I'd like to think that we've positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities, because that is the one thing that in hindsight, right hindsight is 2020, had we been in a position then that we are today, there are opportunities that were presented to us that we were not able to capitalize on. And today, we will be able to capitalize on those. And oftentimes, and I've heard Hap say this right, it's - when the blood is in the water is when we won't be able to count.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Wes Golladay","Can you just comment on the tenant interest from the retail side to be part of these mixed-use projects, the live, work, play. Is it growing, any particular category stand out, and do they have a preference for being extra residential or office?","Mac Chandler","I'm happy to answer that - that one. This is Mac here. We are definitely seeing tenants who are interested in these mixed-use locations and in part because of the quality of the locations. These tend to be of higher densities, better incomes, better access to transit. The office component is a very powerful one and our restaurant tenants really react positively to office.","Because I understand they have to be in our project, but if it's across the street or within a quarter of a mile where people can walk, that really is a big boost to restaurant lunch traffic and also evening traffic, and just having people on site apartments help too as well. It certainly helps with just active food court in the evenings.","But one apartment is not enough to make a big difference. You need a sizable amount of density within a walking distance. But it's also the place making that you often find more in a mixed-use environment than you do in a very traditional environment. And that is something else that the retailers would resonate to.","They want environment where the customers choose this location over other ones, because it's a opportunity to shop, and to dine, to linger, to patronize, and we all know that the longer a customer spends on site, the more they are likely to spend. So there's definitely interest there. We are seeing that more and more.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Mueller","Looking at the past four quarters, it looks like your renewal spreads have increased each quarter. At the same time, the new leasing spreads have gone down each quarter. And I know the new spreads will bounce around more, but is there anything we should be looking into as a trend as it relates to the renewal spreads increasing?","Lisa Palmer","It's - like it's primarily just related to mix. We feel that we've really settled in actually with - in terms of a stabilized level of rent spreads on both renewals and you're absolutely right on new. We could have one transaction that can really drive that. And if you have a 40-year lease essentially that rolls and expires, that can have a significant impact on the percentage.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ki Bin Kim of Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","So I wanted to ask you about how you guys balance and how you think about merchandising mix versus rent. And obviously, you are underwriting businesses all the time, but are you - is there a change in that where it's not just underwriting the business to see if it's a good business and it was Internet-resistant, but trying to even gauge just the management teams at those retailers are forward-thinking enough, dynamic and they're thinking enough where they can be relevant and viable for 10 years down the road. So how do you think about all those things?","Hap Stein","Ki Bin, that kind of goes to the core of our fresh-look philosophy. We are really looking for retailers who get it, who do make a difference, do create that special vibe that can drive traffic and help their neighbor tenants. It's a key ingredient to the way we look at our business and the future of the leasing.","We think we do a pretty good job of that and it is kind of an interesting struggle that you always have on rent versus SKUs versus credit and that whole mix has to come together, and you make a decision on who you think is going to add the most value to your shopping center and that's kind of how we go about it.","Ki Bin Kim","So you made a comment earlier that retailers are maybe taking a little bit longer to decide where to go. Do you - on the flip side, do you think landlords like yourselves are also thinking about - a little bit more about who you bring into your centers and is that a bigger consideration?","Hap Stein","I'm not sure I understood that.","Lisa Palmer","I mean, in terms of the - us being more selective, is that really the question?","Ki Bin Kim","Basically.","Lisa Palmer","Jim mentioned it when he first opened the last answer with fresh-look. It's actually nothing new for us. I mean, we've been really focused on it for several - more than several years now, because the - as the retail environment has been changing and with that pace of change really accelerating, we are really - we try to get in front of it and we understand that people have so many choices today and they can - they don't have to come to our shopping centers.","So we need to ensure that we're making our shopping centers a place where they want to come and want to shop, it's convenient and not only is it convenient, but Jim used the word vibe, it's place making. It has to be a good experience.","Our retailers mentioned that our grocers are focusing on the same thing. Once they are inside of the four walls, it has to be a good experience. Because if it's not, they're not going to come. And we really have begun - I mean, we began focusing on that several years ago and being much more selective with the merchandising mix and the retailers and tenants that we're leasing to.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chris Lucas of CapitalOne Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Just a quick one. On tenant follow-up for the quarter, was that in line with expectations better or worse?","Lisa Palmer","I'll repeat the earlier answer. Every year we come into the year and we do expect to have a seasonal decline in occupancy for - I've been in the business for 23 years. And I think for maybe three of those, we haven't had it. So it was in line with our assumptions. We were kind of hoping that maybe we'd outperform that and we did. So we're still really comfortable with our guidance of 2% to 2.5%. And we have - we essentially still have the same assumptions moving forward for the rest of the year in terms of having a consistent level of move-outs that we - similar to what we've experienced in the past two years to three years.","Chris Lucas","And Lisa, on that move-out rate, any themes this year versus prior year's that maybe differentiated this year's outcome?","Lisa Palmer","I'm sorry, Chris, you're a little muffled.","Hap Stein","Themes on move-outs.","Chris Lucas","I'm sorry.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. No, it is obviously something that we looked at really closely and not only just this year, but we also even - we looked at kind of what's the mix of our tenants that are in our centers and also that are moving out of our centers and what we are leasing to. And amazingly, it is consistent. We still have the same percentage of restaurants, soft goods, service and certainly it is actually a little bit surprising to me when we looked at it.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Stein for closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate your time and interest in Regency, and hope that you guys have a wonderful weekend. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Mas. Thank you. You may now begin.","Michael Mas","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Martin E. Stein","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","In 2013, we reached 2 crucial landmarks. First, we increased the percent leased in the operating portfolio to 95.2%. Second, same-property NOI growth was 4% for the second consecutive year. While those accomplishments stand out most in my mind, we also attained gratifying results in other critical facets of our business. We completed the development of 3 terrific shopping centers that are already 96% leased, representing an investment of $160 million and generating an 8.6% return on incremental capital. And we started nearly $150 million of new ground-up developments, where pre-leasing is already ahead of expectations, as well as more than $50 million of redevelopments. We also generated $350 million from the sale of nonstrategic assets and $100 million from ATM equity issuances at an average price about $53 per share. This activity allowed us to invest in the development and redevelopment projects that I just mentioned to acquire exceptional shopping centers in key markets that will be accretive to our long-term NOI growth profile and to further strengthen what was already a very strong balance sheet.","A part of these positive results is the intense focus from our top-notch team of professionals to drive growth in core earnings, NAV and shareholder value by fully employing Regency's 3 inherent strengths: our portfolio, our development program and our balance sheet. When I look at Regency, I see a portfolio that compares positively to our peers by all key metrics. A company with the unique and core competency to create value to the development and redevelopment of exceptional shopping centers in the country's top markets and a balance sheet that clearly measures up to other blue-chip companies across the REIT landscape.","As we discussed during our guidance call in December, the current health of the portfolio and balance sheet enables us to pivot from being a net seller towards placing more emphasis on growing core earnings. While we will continue to sell lower-growth assets, the primary rationale will be as a source to fund investments. Any future acquisitions will continue to be of the highest quality and have superior growth and\/or upside prospects. They will be funded with additional dispositions of identified properties with low growth rates and cap rates that are roughly comparable to those we are buying. Equity could be an alternative source to fund acquisitions and developments, if the price becomes sufficiently favorable in relationship to our view of NAV to justify the high bar that will continue to be set for issuances. The end result of this net investment activity will be an even higher quality portfolio with an enhanced future NOI growth rate. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone.","Core FFO for the year was $2.63 per share, which is at the upper end of the most recent guidance provided in mid-December. FFO per share was $0.03 ahead of guidance due to the delayed closing of our Fairfield, Connecticut properties, which pushes the related transaction costs into 2014.","As Hap said, in 2013, we made significant progress towards the achievement of our strategic objectives, not the least of which was reaching and exceeding 95% leased and achieving same-property NOI growth of 4%. In addition, in terms of the balance sheet, we ended the year with $90 million of cash on hand and no outstanding balance on our $800 million line of credit. Our net debt-to-core EBITDA ratio now stands at less than 6x, and we are comfortably on a path to achieve our targeted ratios through organic growth and core earnings over the next few years.","We also strive for a low-laddered maturity profile and manage interest rate risk when appropriate by locking in long-term rates. We hope to capitalize on what continues to be a borrower's market as we address our April unsecured bond maturities. Included in our current projections is a $250 million bond issuance on which we've already hedged our base rate exposure. Even if there's a modest expansion from today's credit spreads, we'd still be looking at an all-in effective rate of less than 4%. We are also hedged for $250 million of 2015 maturities at just 30 basis points higher.","Looking at 2014, our guidance for operating metrics and financial results remains unchanged from what we presented in December. Core FFO per share is expected to be in the range of $2.66 to $2.72 per share and to be relatively evenly distributed throughout the year.","I'd like to remind everyone that the $100 million of equity issued, combined with net property sales in 2013, impact this year's growth by roughly 5%. In terms of occupancy, with the possibility of a few identified junior anchor and seasonal move-outs, we could see a dip in the first quarter, but we expect to end the year at the high end of our same-property percent leased guidance range.","You will notice changes to both acquisitions and dispositions guidance. The majority of these changes to account for the timing of the closing of the Fairfield, Connecticut properties, which Brian will discuss later. As discussed during our December call, we simply rolled the acquisition from 2013 into 2014. The loan assumption process is almost complete and we anticipate closing on this portfolio in the very near future. We also increased acquisition and disposition guidance, each, by $25 million on the upper end as we've recently gained control of another high NOI growth acquisition opportunity in Austin. We plan to fund that purchase with additional property sales. As Hap said, the cap rates should be roughly comparable for the dispositions that will fund our acquisitions.","Lastly, but importantly, we announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend. Many factors go into the decision to raise the dividend, the most important of which is our view of the positive prospects for future increases in earnings and operating cash flows, balanced by our intent to maintain conservative financial metrics including the payout ratio. Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. As Hap and Lisa both stated, the results for 2013 were strong. The teams have been dogged in their execution of our strategy and the result has been steady and marked improvement in nearly every operating metrics. Same-property percent leased climbed to 95.1% at the end of the fourth quarter. Small shops were nearly 90% leased at year end, representing 150-basis point improvement over 2012. The team built percent leased by signing 5 million square feet of new and renewal leases during the year. In addition, we continue to see a positive trend in move-outs compared to prior years. Combined move-outs in the third and fourth quarters totaled less than 600,000 square feet, making it the first time since 2006 we've seen 2 quarters with move-outs that low. Rent growth for new leases was positive 10.7% in the fourth quarter and an even stronger 17.7% for the year. These accomplishments resulted in 4% same-property NOI growth, excluding term fees, for the second year in a row.","With our high-quality portfolio now above 95% leased, same-property NOI will benefit as pre-leasing converts to rent paying. But in general, occupancy gains will play a lesser role. Therefore, the operation team's emphasis is on taking rent growth back to our historic level of 10% or more.","In addition, the team continues to successfully execute leases that include higher and more frequent contractual rent steps. Rent growth and embedded steps are key components of our formula to meet our objective for future NOI growth.","Moving to development, we completed 3 projects in the fourth quarter. Combined, they are more than 96% leased, with an 8.6% return on incremental capital. What's more, the projects took, on average, only 21 months to stabilize from start of construction. While each of these projects is exceptional, I can't help but continue to spotlight the team's hard work and success at our Grand Ridge Plaza project, a 325,000-square foot center to celebrate its grand opening at 99% leased. It took only 18 months for commencement and construction to complete. The community response following the opening has been overwhelmingly positive. In my 30 years in the development business, it's one of the best projects I've seen.","Our in-process developments are also performing extremely well. The 6 projects, including 2 that have not yet started vertical construction, are 82% leased and committed. During our third quarter call, we discussed our fourth quarter starts, Fresh Market-anchored shops on Riverside in Jacksonville and the Mariano's-anchored Glen Gate in Chicago. These new starts, along with our other projects, are progressing nicely into tracking best-in-class operators, including a new Whole Foods that will be added in our Shops on Main project in suburban Chicago.","We also started 6 redevelopments during the fourth quarter, with total cost of $16 million and a projected return approaching 10%. This brings our total in-process redevelopment pipeline to $53 million across 13 active projects.","Turning to the fourth quarter transactions, we acquired 2 properties, Fellsway Plaza in Boston, which we introduced in the third quarter call, and Holly Park. Holly Park is a 160,000-square foot center with a prime location within Raleigh's Inner Beltline. The center benefits from a strong daytime population and has several anchors, including the highly productive Trader Joe's.","As Lisa mentioned, we're also under contract on a portfolio of 3 properties totaling 315,000 square feet in partnership with the current owner of the centers. The portfolio is located in Fairfield, Connecticut, an affluent community with extraordinary trade barriers [ph] and a 96% market occupancy rate. They are dominant centers, with the 2 downtown properties representing the heart and soul of the town. Regency is acquiring an 80% interest in the portfolio for $120 million.","Similar to Fellsway, the Fairfield partner is a local sharpshooter and we really like the potential to work together on future opportunities. Across-the-board from leasing to development to portfolio enhancement, 2013 was certainly a successful year, and I look forward to that trend continuing into 2014. Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Brian and Lisa. I want to close by mentioning 2 remarkable milestones that we celebrated last year.","2013 was Regency's 50th year in business and its 20th year as a public company. We've grown by a good bit since then, since the company was founded and went public and we are only 1 of only 18 REITs out of the 45 in the class of 1993 that are still around. Most important of all, we are proud of Regency's total annual shareholder return of nearly 12% since our initial public offering, which has outpaced both the REIT and shopping center indices. In the 50 years since the company was founded and the 20 years since we went public, we've made monumental strides in building Regency. Learning as we grow, adapting to change, sharpening our strategy, delivering value and doing what is right. We've done so by always keeping the best interest of our 4 constituencies in mind: our people, our communities, our retail customers and our shareholders. By staying true to these values, I'm confident that our company will flourish for another 50 years.","We thank you for your time and now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kin Bin -- Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about your big markets, Florida, California and Texas? And how those individual markets are performing relative to your portfolio?","Brian M. Smith","Sure. Southern California -- California is really -- continues to be I think a tale of 2 states. You've got Coastal California and you've got non-coastal. Coastal California, which is where virtually all of our assets are, is really on fire. And if you look at Northern California, in particular, I think we are 97% leased there, very strong, and I would say that's pretty much true with Southern California as well. With, again, the non-coastal California, it is improving. But right now, Sacramento and the Central Valley would remain weaker markets, although they have significantly improved. Texas is a large market. Texas is one of the -- all of the markets in Texas are outstanding markets. Austin, Houston leading the way, but Dallas is also strong. And then, Florida, which has lagged, has really started coming on of late. Northern Florida is a little bit weaker than the rest. But all of Florida overall has made great strides over the last several quarters.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And just tied to that, given your commentary about how strong the markets are doing, your occupancy levels, how far do you think the industry is from development really coming back into the picture?","Brian M. Smith","I think we are getting close. We are starting to run into competition like we haven't done before. We competed, for example -- well, I would say that the developments we're starting to see competition on are pretty limited to California, Texas, Washington D.C. But even in those markets, there's been good competition. We went after -- participated in an RFP in Northern California and there were 12 respondents to it. Now a lot of those were small and I think we fare really well on those types of things, but we've lost some properties, some opportunities lately. So we're starting to see developers again for the really good assets take-on risks that they hadn't been willing to do before. We're seeing a lot of hard money put up on day 1 of the contract execution. We're seeing returns, in some cases, spread over what people perceive the exit cap rate to be, so it would -- could be sub 7%. And you're seeing, particularly in Texas, in the really hot market like Houston, people not only saw them for low returns but being willing to close on 30 days without entitlements and anchors. So you're starting to see it. Overall, I know the construction industry is forecasting 10% increase in starts. I don't know if that's true or not, but we are seeing more activity.","Martin E. Stein","A couple of follow-up comments in that regard. Number one, in spite of the additional competition both comments relayed, we still think that we can get our fair share. We're well positioned to do that at -- in the range of 8% returns that we're projecting. Not all are going to be -- achieve that, but we think we can get pretty close to that. Secondly, from a supply standpoint, which I think is equally as important, even though we would expect supply to -- supply right now is less than 1% of the historic stock -- of the stock. That's about 1\/3 of historic standards. And even though supply may increase, and development may increase, I think it will still continue to be well, well below historic standards.","Lisa Palmer","And I'll -- I'd add, I think one of the things that's governing that -- and we recently met with one of our banks, this is a very large lender in the real estate industry, and they're still requiring quite a bit of equity from developers. Regency obviously is very well positioned and has competitive advantage versus some of the private, smaller guys. They're looking -- they're loaning to cost, not to value, and requiring 25% to 50% of equity, depending on that developer's balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Carlington from Green Street Advisors.","Jay Carlington","Great. So just -- you mentioned your occupancy is kind of trending at -- towards the top end of where you're comfortable with, and I guess, there's going to be an increased focus on rent growth. So can you kind of talk about the releasing spreads going forward and -- the blended releasing spreads and how we should be thinking about that type of growth? Are we looking at mid single digits or is it more upside there?","Brian M. Smith","If you look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it can be fairly choppy. But it shows the continual increasing trend over the last many quarters. So we think the environment is very positive, to continue that positive trend. And as I said, there may be some choppy quarters both above and below the trend line really based on anchor tenants. And -- but I think it's driven by strong fundamentals. Not only are we greater than 95% leased with a lot stronger portfolio than we used to have, but Hap pointed out that supply growth remains almost nonexistent and the retailers are getting more aggressive. So it's broad-based. We're seeing it in almost all of our leases, the rent growth. Just -- I think we've only got one target market that experienced negative growth this past year, and it was less than 1%. And the weaker market, as I mentioned also, Florida is starting to pick up. So we believe we can get to our historic level of double digits and continue this positive trend.","Jay Carlington","Okay, great. And maybe just quick follow-up. Can you give us a quick update on what's going on in Chicago with Dominick's? It looks like Whole Foods picked up one of your spots. So what's the outlook look for the rest of the remaining locations you have?","Brian M. Smith","It turned out to be really good for us. We've got -- as you know, there's 6 operating Dominick's that we have up there. Four of the leases were purchased and 1 is very, very close to being finalized. So 5 and 6 will have replacement grocers. Whole Foods, as you mentioned, bought 1, and then Mariano's bought 3. The other one, we are pretty certain to it, but I'd rather not say until we know for sure. And what we will do is -- Whole Foods and one of the Mariano's will be redevelopment. And the Mariano's that's taken the Dominick's will be about 90,000 square feet and will take that rent up significantly. And the other one, the Whole Foods redevelopment, Whole Foods rent will stay flat for the remaining of term that was -- still in that lease, the Dominick's lease, which is about 12 years or so, and then it'll jump up probably 2x. But in the meantime, as part of the redevelopment, Whole Foods will use all of its money, demise the existing store, build themselves brand new, and do a facade renovation and create a 12,000-square foot junior anchor next door to them,which we should be able to re-lease that at significantly higher rent than the underlying Dominick's lease.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Pong from Robert W. Baird.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I know this is looking a little further out, but can you shed light as to how you're thinking about the non core dispositions spigot beyond 2014? I guess, what I'm trying to get at is how we should think about the sources of long-term funding for the bulk of your redevelopment and redevelopment activity?","Lisa Palmer","We will always plan to sell properties to fund our developments. I don't think -- it's not prudent to have a business model that depends on issuance of equity. So our business model is our dispositions. It'll be lower-growth properties, which are the non core. And as the quality of those lower-growth non core properties improves, the spread between what we're selling and what we're developing will actually widen. So instead of selling properties at a 7% cap rate and developing at an 8%, we should get closer to selling to a 6% and developing at it -- or at least a 200 basis point spread even if cap rates move one way or the other. So that's how you should think about it beyond 2014 as a source of funding for our developments. And then to the extent that we have opportunity for great acquisitions, again, we would look first to our pool of properties that we could sell at a comparable cap rate but at a lower growth, so that we're, in essence, enhancing our future growth rate of the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi.","Katy McConnell","This is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Could you talk a little bit about how you see the food component in your centers trending over time? And to what extent you're leasing to more restaurant users, both national, regional as well as local operators?","Brian M. Smith","Sure. We're seeing a lot of leasing with the grocers and a lot of that's going on with your specialty grocers. If you look at just our development and redevelopment work that we're doing right now plus some re-tenanting, we're working with 37 new grocers. So we're seeing a lot of that. The food or -- the restaurants, yes, the restaurants we've got it looks like 113,000 square feet net add this past quarter from the restaurants. And what's going on there is just the restaurants, in many ways, are becoming the new anchors, which you'll hear. And they're not all doing well, but fast casual is white-hot right now. And the reason for that really is just the time becomes such a precious commodity, and so those restaurants are doing well. On the other hand, kind of the traditional family dining, the Macaroni Grill, the Ruby Tuesday and all of those, they are not faring very well. And I think you're going to see some closures in that sector. Anything that has healthy living associated with it in the food group is also hot. So overall, I think you're going to see continued amount of restaurant strength, particularly among the fast casual and the healthy lines. And then the strength in the grocery sector remains, especially grocers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Juan Sanabria here with Craig. Just wanted to ask on the acquisition that seemed like it's slipped, I guess, from the fourth quarter into early this year. Can you tell us a little bit about that asset and kind of the valuation of cap rate you're targeting? You kind of made a comment that going forward the acquisitions and disposition cap rates would be closer in terms of spreads. And if I look at your guidance, you're kind of targeting disposition cap rates of 7% to 7.5%. Should we think that the acquisitions going forward would be at that sort of level or am I -- did I misunderstand?","Lisa Palmer","I'll let Brian talk about the assets. I'll answer the latter part of your question first. My response to Jay is similar, is that you have to think about our dispositions, our funding, our developments. So the disposition cap rate of 7% and 7.5% is funding developments of approximately 8%. To the extent that we -- and Fairfield was really in our guidance of 2013 acquisitions, so that was already prefunded. We have cash sitting on the balance sheet ready to deploy -- to buy that asset. For 2014, any acquisition that we identify, we will then increase the dispositions guidance. And again, as we've said in our prepared remarks, in this case, we identified an asset in Austin, Texas for approximately $25 million, so we increased our acquisitions guidance by $25 million on top of Fairfield, and then our dispositions guidance by $25 million. The assets we will identify for that additional $25 million will have a cap rate comparable to what we will pay for the asset in Austin. So -- and that acquisition guidance is in the 5% range.","Martin E. Stein","So it would either in effect be the same cap rate maybe 50 to 100 basis points higher, but that's...","Lisa Palmer","Comparable.","Martin E. Stein","Very comparable.","Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","[indiscernible]","Martin E. Stein","Zero.","Lisa Palmer","Zero. Yes. We're going to -- the goal is to identify assets with lower growth than our comparable cap rates. We will not have dilution from acquiring assets. It should be accretive. It should be neutral to the current year and accretive to future years because of the higher growth rate.","Brian M. Smith","[indiscernible] I'm sorry. Do you want me to follow up and tell you about the portfolio or did you just want to do another...","Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, please, please.","Brian M. Smith","Okay, all right. So we kind of talked about 315,000 square feet, it's just with 3 properties in Fairfield. Two of the properties are on the main drag, right in the middle of the city. And it truly is kind of a \"live, work, play\" environment where the entire town congregates around those properties. The portfolio is almost 100% leased. It's 99.6%. Great market, extraordinary trade barriers, high occupancy rate. And what we like about this is, is it lines up with exactly the kind of properties we want to buy, dominant infill retail that has unique competitive advantages and the ability to merchandise to best-in-class retailers and restaurants. And this one has some truly great restaurants and retailers where people just -- it connects very strongly with the community. The one thing I think that makes this particularly special here is that even though it's downtown urban retail, it has plenty of self-contained parking. Actually, if you look at the downtown properties, it's 5.2 spaces per thousand, which is better than a lot of retail that you get even in the suburbs. So a lot to like about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yasmine Kamaruddin from JPMorgan.","Yasmine Kamaruddin - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you guys had a really nice small-shop occupancy gain from the third quarter and also year-over-year. Where do you think you'll end up in 2014 on this metric?","Lisa Palmer","If you look at our same-property percent leased guidance of 94.5% to 95.5%, we did lose some of the junior anchor space. So some of that pickup from occupancy from here will come from there. But I would say that for the most part, it's going to be about 75% of the -- occupancy pickup is going to be coming from the small-shop space.","Martin E. Stein","So 90% to 92%.","Yasmine Kamaruddin - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And also, for your budget, what are you assuming happens to bad debt?","Brian M. Smith","What was the question?","Martin E. Stein","Bad debt assumption.","Lisa Palmer","We finished this year at, call, approximately 40 bps of our revenues and the health of the portfolio is really strong that we would expect it to be consistent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Moore from RBC Capital.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You've always -- just following up on that last question. You've always been good at getting the mom-and-pops sort of tenant in the small shops. And I'm curious, is that changing? Are you heading more toward the national and maybe the regional-type tenant as the most likely one to take up small shop space? And also, are you seeing -- I've seen some of these urgent care centers and dental offices, medical offices, that kind of stuff. Does that play a role at all as well in the small-shop leasing?","Brian M. Smith","It does, Rich. We -- I'm not sure our data is perfect on this. But if you look at the statistics, what it would tell you is since 2007 the amount of nationals and regionals is -- in the portfolio is a lot higher. And that today, we're doing probably 20%, 25%, it would say, local tenants. But the problem with the local tenants designation is you could have a restaurant like we have here in Jacksonville, Mellow Mushroom, which may have 3 very successful locations and it's considered local. If you talk to the field, what you would hear is that almost never will we, and it may not have an almost in that, we just do not take flyers on start-up businesses where somebody doesn't have experience. So any local is going to have at least one other store and likely a whole lot more. What was the second part, Rich? I'm sorry about that.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No. The urgent care and the dental offices, the medical office, that kind of stuff, Brian.","Brian M. Smith","That's been a trend for the last few years as you are seeing more and more that I think a demographic shift in the country is demanding it. And the dentists, the chiropractors, all those things, they want the same things that you have in the shopping centers, the good visibility, the convenient parking, have traffic at your front door as you go into the grocery store. They are representing a good amount of leasing in our portfolio today.","Martin E. Stein","And they're merchandising their space much better than they had in the past, more sophisticated operators.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So what do you think, just to follow up on that, guys, what do you think are the credit qualities of that group, that medical sort of group? Is it easy to get comfortable, I guess, with -- how good one is over the other?","Brian M. Smith","I think it's harder to -- and think it's harder to differentiate which one is a better operator, one dentist versus another, whereas, I think in the retail and restaurant world we have a real good idea on that. But what we do like about those users is they put a lot of money into those spaces, which we think is going to result in minor leases or reduced downtime and turnover.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz from UBS.","Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was just looking at your same-store NOI growth trend in the back half of '13 was trending towards the low end of your 2.5% to 3.5% guidance in '14. And with occupancy gains likely limited, just wondering what do you think will drive a re-acceleration of that growth back to the mid or even high point? Is that just the expected leasing spread or is there some development baked into that?","Brian M. Smith","Well, first of all, I think if you look at 2013, you have to be careful in concluding that there was a deceleration in the second half of the year. I think unlike most prior years, you have to look at the full year number as opposed to the discrete quarters. And the reason for that is, there were some timing differences in the first 2 quarters, which elevated those numbers at the expense of the second half of the year. So 4% is really, I think, how you have to look at it. But going forward, we said all along that our goal is 3% same-property NOI growth, and we still feel very comfortable with the components. The rent growth we've talked about, we think we can take that from the high single digits into the double digits. And the rent steps, we're getting the embedded steps of about 1.3% or so. So the 2 of those combined get us to about 2.5% of the 3% we're looking for. In terms of occupancy, I think we've mentioned in the initial remarks, maybe less lift, but we still have all the pre-leasing that has to move into occupancy. And right now, we're doing a lot more leasing of the space that has been vacant for more than 12 months, so we're going to get some lift from that. And then after that, there's miscellaneous income, other ways we can grow it. But we feel pretty good that we should be able to get to the same 3% that we've strived -- that's been our target and there's not a deceleration going on.","Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just the space that's been vacant grand in 12 months, I mean, you've been talking about the rent spread getting back to double digit, unless -- it seems like outside of a few abnormalities, that's been closer to cash spreads around 3% to 5%. So I'm just wondering where the double digit is? Does just have to do with some of function of what you have coming due and some of those vacant spaces during the 12 months that you feel confident on that you can get to a higher bump up to that double-digit level?","Brian M. Smith","I don't think the rent growth is going to be high from the things that have been vacant for a long time. But we're going from 0 rent to rent. So that's what's going to drive a lot of the same-property NOI growth there. In terms of the spread, it's all a function of what comes vacant. I mean, I can tell you right now, we've got 36 RadioShacks, and I think you've heard that there's going to be 500 store closings and we've looked at every one of those 36 and we see only 1 rolling back And we've got rent growth in there as high as 70%, 75% on some of them. Overall, probably 15% higher. But then Mariano's, as I told you about, I mean, talking about taking rents on a very large space from mid single digits well, well into double digits. So those kind of things provide plenty of rent growth and really the benefit lease stuff has been baking for 12 months is more same-property NOI growth.","Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just to be clear, the double digit is a cash-basis spread, right?","Brian M. Smith","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities.","Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Lisa, you had mentioned that there's a risk to first quarter profit occupancy. I guess, Brian, I was wondering if you could provide just a quick assessment of what tenant fallout looks like so far this quarter compared to the year ago period at this point?","Brian M. Smith","When we look at historical change in occupancy quarter-by-quarter, and the first quarter is always the worst, right? It averages about 25 basis points drop in occupancy whereas the other 3 quarters were all positive. So I think as we get our budget at the end of last year and our guidance, we have taken into consideration that seasonal factor. So what I would say is that, last year, that negative 25 basis points never materialized. We're actually positive 10 basis points, and what we've seen so far this quarter, and it doesn't mean it will continue, but we've seen so far this quarter is that a lot of the move-outs are not materializing and we're tracking much better than expected.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Hap Stein for closing comments.","Martin E. Stein","We thank you for your interest, your participation and hope you guys that are in snow-affected areas be safe, and take care. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"18587":["Regency Centers (NASDAQ:REG) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 31, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Mike Mas","Martin E.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Mas. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Mas","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Brian Smith, Lisa Palmer, and Chris Leavitt. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We believe the steps we've taken over the last several years to enhance our portfolio, our development program and balance sheet are positioning us to consistently perform up to Regency standards. 2012, the hard work and focus of our dedicated team were clearly evident in the operating and financial results. You will hear from Lisa and Brian in detail, but I want to highlight the many notable accomplishments.","The performance of the leasing team was exceptional, pushing same property operating portfolio to 94.5% leased. We started to exhibit pricing power as evidenced by rent growth of 5.5% including nearly 20% on new leases. These factors, which were aided by robust demand, health of our tenants and lessening supply of available space produce same property NOI growth of 4%.","Development team started 4 and completed 9 irreplaceable shopping centers, and transformed another 5 centers through redevelopment, adding an estimated $75 million of value. Transaction team continued to enhance the quality of the overall portfolio. They sold more than $450 million of shopping centers that no longer met Regency's risk, strategic or NOI growth objectives. We also acquired high-quality shopping centers with compelling, future growth profiles. The capital markets' team further fortified Regency's solid balance sheet and access to capital. These efforts combined to produce core FFO per share of nearly 7%, most important of all, an increase in total shareholder return of more than 30%.","To be sure, we recognize that a single year's positive results do not define Regency's standard for success. This is particularly the case in light of our view that economic growth, while positive, will likely be slow for the foreseeable future, and our tenants will continue to operate in an increasingly competitive environment. That said, it is worth noting that 2013 will be Regency's 50th year in business. Our experience over the last 5 decades have molded and enhanced, what I am convinced, is a tried and true formula that will sustain growth and shareholder value. Regency's strategy starts with an intense focus on producing reliable growth and NOI, which is the cornerstone to generating consistent increasing -- increases in earnings and net asset value. We will continue to pursue acquisitions and developments that meet our strict standards, our comparable quality to our most recent investments and will fortify the reliability of the portfolio's NOI. At the same time, we are playing offense. We're extremely vigilant and proactive about identifying and continuing to sell the ever declining share of centers that may no longer be consistent with our strategy. Our ability to create meaningful value through disciplined development and redevelopment of irreplaceable shopping centers is one of our core competencies, which we will continue to profit from and is the second key generator of growth in NAV. A solid balance sheet, which we remained committed to, managing in the conservative and prudent fashion.","Finally, we'll keep our most fundamental asset, our people, engaged and focused on the achievement of these key objectives. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap. Good morning, everyone. As Hap stated, our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year were very good. With core FFO of $0.63 per share for the quarter and $2.56 per share for the year. Being $0.03 above the high end of our most guidance was a result of exceeding expectations in November and December. Primarily, first, federal leasing; second, lower move-outs; third, lower real estate tax expense. And all those combined produced higher recovery rates. Same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 4% for the year. Almost of all this growth was attributable to base rent, which was largely the result of occupancy gains primarily from non-anchor spaces combined with built-in contractual rent steps.","In the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge of $50 million triggered by the decision to sell Deer Springs Town Center and exit the Las Vegas market. Given the difficulty of efficiently leasing and managing this large single asset in a state where we have no plans to grow, we believe it makes sense to exit the market at this time. I'd also like to briefly explain the fourth quarter income tax expense. We employed tax planning strategies in our taxable REIT subsidiary at year end to maximize the benefits of a net operating loss. These strategies generated taxable gains and a related noncash income tax expense. As Hap mentioned and as we've previously communicated, we made significant progress in 2012 executing our portfolio enhancement strategy. This is positioning Regency for better long-term sustainable growth. However, in the short-term, being a net seller in 2012 will have a dilutive impact on '13. But even with that being said, the strong leasing and better-than-expected moveouts in December will result in higher-than-expected average occupancy in 2013. As such, we've increased our '13 full year earnings guidance. We now expect core FFO per share in the range of $2.48 to $2.56, an increase of $0.03 to both ends of our range of the initial guidance. Our guidance for same property NOI remains unchanged to 2% to 3%.","Lastly, although I recently moved into his office, my predecessor, who is also my mentor and very dear friend, Bruce Johnson, left a legacy of conservative and astute balance sheet management that I'm committed to carrying on. This means we will continue to monitor our maturities and commitments, while maintaining significant capacity on our line of credit. To that end, in 2012, we increased the capacity in our lines to $800 million, of which $730 million is currently available. And although we don't have any significant maturities in 2013, we took advantage of historically low interest rates by hedging the base treasury rate and swap rate on 60% of our 2014 and 2015 maturities. We remain comfortable with our current leverage levels though we'll always look to opportunistically enhance our balance sheet strength by focusing on long-term targets of net debt to EBITDA of less than 5.5x and a fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than 2.75x. Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. The fourth quarter was a near-perfect way to cap off what was a very good year in all aspects of our portfolio. Strong leasing momentum continued to drive the business. We signed more new leases in the operating portfolio than any year on record, taking the same property portfolio to 94.5% leased.","Moveouts in 2012 were the lowest they've been since 2007, and a significant portion of this occupancy gain came from small shop space. In fact, our percent leased for spaces less than 10,000 square feet increased 170 basis points in 2012 and currently stands greater than 88% leased. In addition, the average rent assigned for small shops increased for the seventh consecutive quarter. Given the strength of our leasing pipeline, we continued lack of new supply coming online in the slow but steady upward trajectory of the macroeconomy and remain optimistic that our goal of 95% leased is well within our sites and there's certainly no reason we should stop there. What makes this even more satisfying is the fact that we increased occupancy, while simultaneously improving both the tenant caliber and merchandising mix in our shopping centers. We did this not only by leveraging our considerable relationships with strong national tenants, but also with well-capitalized, innovative and exciting local and regional concepts that are considered fixtures in their local communities.","As we all know, the grocery business is very competitive and a dynamic one. With that in mind, I'd like to provide a quick update on SUPERVALU. After recently meeting with them, we are more comfortable in our belief that our exposure to store closures remains limited and our initial impression of the recently announced transaction is that it reduces uncertainty and may even improve their long-term operating prospects. Continuing on this topic of portfolio enhancement, the fourth quarter was important for us. We closed on the purchase of 4 exceptional assets, all of which were secured on off-market basis. Uptown Shopping Center is located in a dense urban area of San Diego. This asset combines street front retail with 2 top-notch grocery anchors, Trader Joe's and Ralphs. It's the only center in the trade area with convenient surface parking, which gives it a real and unique competitive advantage. The combined grocery sales are more than $70 million per year; it also has structured parking. The center draws from a 3-mile population of 223,000 with strong household incomes and offers incredible remerchandising potential.","On the other side of the country, Phillips Place is located in the highly desirable South Park submarket of Charlotte, North Carolina across from one of the most successful regional malls in the Southeast. Phillips Place has average incomes of $128,000 and benefits from a very strong daytime population. Phillips' roster reflects the prestige of the local market with tenants like Dean & DeLuca, Brooks Brothers, Restoration Hardware and The Palm. Village Plaza is anchored by a high-volume Whole Foods that serves the local market of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and benefits from its proximity to the University. This asset represents exemplary neighborhood retail real estate and comes from the redevelopment opportunity to further improve its already strong, long-term growth prospects.","And last but not certainly not least, Sandy Springs is a generational asset in an affluent infill neighborhood of Atlanta anchored by a highly successful Trader Joe's. We also see an opportunity to harvest additional growth by remerchandising the center to better serve the needs of the trade area. These centers along with those acquired in the first 3 quarters of the year are excellent additions to our portfolio, with average 3-mile populations and household incomes that when combined, exceed our $200,000 target and grocery sales of more than $1,000 per square foot which is double our goal. And perhaps most importantly, they enjoy the long-term, sustainable competitive advantages that will make them accretive to our NOI growth profile for years to come.","During the quarter, we also closed on the sale of 3 assets providing further enhancement to our portfolio. To a certain extent, all 3 were inconsistent with our strategy and had reached peak value. Specifically, one was a standalone Whole Foods in Santa Barbara, California, that we sold at a 5% cap rate. With no side shops to provide growth, we believe this asset was fully valued at a price representing a $1,000 per square foot. With these dispositions and the planned sale of Deer Springs, our remaining pool of nonstrategic properties currently targeted for sale represents approximately 3% of our portfolio. If sold, some of the properties could generate gains, while others could be at loss. But if there are losses, the aggregate amount would be dwarfed by the magnitude of the Deer Springs impairment. Our in-processing completed developments are performing very well and saw a huge demand during 2012 as evidenced by 860,000 square feet of new development leasing. The 9 development completions leased up quickly and are currently more than 97% leased.","As a matter fact, our fourth quarter completions on average stabilized just 80 days after anchor opening and have an incremental return on invested capital of more than 10%. Our in-process projects, the majority of which were 2012 starts, are already 86% leased and we expect them to be around 95% leased by the end of 2013.","In closing, I, like Hap and Lisa, am proud of the progress that has been made over the past 2 years and we look forward to seeing just how far we can go. Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Brian and Lisa. Like I said, one good year doesn't automatically translate into many. It doesn't define Regency's standard for success. But I'm extremely gratified with what we've accomplished and feel very good about where we're headed. Our team of talented people has worked extremely hard and is poised to have continued success in building shareholder value in 2013. We now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Michael Mueller first, from JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, first, on the Blackstone-preferred investment. And what's embedded in guidance in terms of the timing of either having calling that or having it redeemed?","Lisa Palmer","We're currently assuming that we go the full term basically which would be December 31 of '13.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, I guess, second question. Brian, to your comments about you still have about 3% of the portfolio targeted for sale. About how long of a time period do you think that covers to go through that 3%?","Brian M. Smith","It all depends. Those are the hardest assets to sell, so it all depends on the demand for them and all. But I would think that we would be out of that in a couple of years.","Lisa Palmer","But we're -- and also...","Brian M. Smith","And then it will be ongoing. There'll always be some assets that will be at the bottom of the portfolio that will be part of the annual recycling process.","Lisa Palmer","I think, I know, Mike, you've been covering this for a long time. For many years, our strategy has been portfolio enhancement or capital recycling, and to sell what we always said was the bottom 3% of the portfolio every year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Christy McElroy, UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Brian, I just wanted to follow up on the Q4 acquisitions you talked about. What percentage of the deals that you looked at were ones in which sellers were motivated to sell before year end for tax reasons? I know you mentioned they were off-market. And how would you characterize the current environment for acquisition opportunities?","Brian M. Smith","A lot of activity, I think, in the last probably 4, 5 months of the year, it was related to people who wanted to sell it before they saw the tax rates go up. And I think that was a definite factor in the increased activity. I'd say, in current environment right now, Christy, it's probably too early to tell. There's been some speculation that people now are not willing to sell because of the higher taxes. But I just -- I don't think there's enough data out there yet to know. So we kind of view it right now as status quo and we are seeing some pretty good opportunities.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, Lisa, I guess this is a question for you. Did Paseo del Sol drive the entire developmental gain in the quarter? And how much of that gain flowed through to FFO and core FFO?","Lisa Palmer","It was most of it. The gains -- on our guidance page anyway, we have one line that we've netted of other transaction costs as well. All of the gains flowed through FFO, but none through core FFO.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And why did that gain, why did that center, why did that qualify as a development gain instead of a gain on operating property? It looks like it was built in 2004.","Lisa Palmer","We just completed it last year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, the first question on in-process development. Can you just talk about what's happening with the, I guess, rents and construction cost because I was noticing that on Grand Ridge, the yield pulled back a little bit sequentially from Q3 into Q4 with costs up and it -- Erwin Mill, similarly the yield dropped despite the anchor opening, moving up a little bit. Is there something that's specific to just -- for those projects? Or is there something else going on that maybe has a broader implication?","Brian M. Smith","I'd say, Jeff, it's specific to Grand Ridge. In fact, this morning I was looking at -- if you look at the 12 ground-up construction projects excluding the redevelopments but including phases on the projects, so that's 12, and the total costs are up across that whole portfolio about 2%, which is $3.4 million and $3.9 million of that is Grand Ridge. So the other 11 properties actually came in $500,000 lower. So what's going on with Grand Ridge -- and Grand Ridge may not end up being $3.9 million because we still have $2 million of the contingency that we didn't tap, we just increased the cost. What's going on in Grand Ridge is that, that's in one of those very, very difficult to entitle markets. I've said this before, but the last property that's developed up there, was developed 20 years ago, that took 12 years to entitle. And what happened is the city just demanded a lot of upgrades that weren't in the original budget. Everything from enhanced lighting, landscaping, expanded plaza, areas and the like. There was a little bit of probably a miss on our part. We originally had the big boxes price -- I think it was $120 a square foot and then our pricing down in northern California for the same tenants came in lower, so we reduced the price when we did the original budget. And in fact, they came in where they were originally targeted at $120. So long answer to a short conclusion, which is it's all related to Grand Ridge.","Martin E. Stein","There's a little bit of pressure though on construction cost right now.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, I guess, Brian, and how are you sourcing new development? Is it from land on the books, in new purchases? And if I could just toss one in for Lisa. I might have missed it. Can you just repeat the reason why the write-down on Deer Springs?","Lisa Palmer","Who do want to answer first?","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I'll let you decide.","Brian M. Smith","That was a clever bifurcate. Okay. The -- I'll start the developments. The developments are sourced the way we will always have. And we've got people out in the markets that in some cases have been working on properties for years, trying to get them. And then we do have 400 or 200 acres of land held for development, some of that we'll be tapping. So if you look at what we expect to do in 2013, one of those, and the large one will come out of land held, and all the other ones -- and the one that we've actually been pursuing, working on for 19 years. Other than that, they're all recently sourced opportunities.","Lisa Palmer","And for Deer Springs, as Brian talked about, we do have another 3% of the portfolio that we've identified that we'd like to sell. But as he said, the sale of those is really uncertain. What's different about Deer Springs is that we're -- we think it's more likely than not that we will sell it at some time in the next -- call it next several years, specifically because we want to exit the market and we have accepted that we will take a price at which we've written it down to. And because it's very difficult to manage and lease such a large asset, when we don't have a local office.","Operator","Then we'll go next to Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a question on CapEx. If I take your disclosure on Page 13 and I back it away from FFO and I take away the straight line, it's actually coming up with a number that's lower than your dividend. But that's also not fair because obviously you're upping occupancy and that takes a lot of CapEx as well. So do you have any idea of the sense of what are your kind of true run rate CapEx would be? And if you put that in, will you be covering your dividend?","Lisa Palmer","I'll let Brian address the CapEx run rate. But first, let me -- we had a lot of noncash expenses this year with preferred issuance cost write-offs. We also redid our term loan and our line and that also was from noncash expenses. So we did cover our dividend this year. I would expect that we're going to be covering it in the future as well. But I'll let Brian answer the CapEx run rate question.","Brian M. Smith","Yes. Our white box, which are really driving it, as you said, is related to a lot of things. One, which is the highest volumes of leasing. In 2012, it was $0.60 a square foot and we think in 2013, we'll reduce that by about 1\/3, get it down to $0.40 a foot and it will be even lower in 2014. What's going on there is not only have we done a lot of leasing in 2011 and '12 but a lot of leasing was to restaurants which required some upgrades and building renovation, but also a lot of anchor activity, releasing of anchor space, where we had to, in some cases, replace and fix buildings where we you had an anchor in there for 20 years. In some cases, we had to combine small shop spaces to create a much larger space which is very expensive. And then we had several examples of larger spaces being subdivided where you got to do all kinds of work to the building so that's what's really driving it.","Martin E. Stein","And said in another way, our routine building improvements should run about $0.55 a square foot. Brian indicated our white boxing in 2012 was $0.60. We expect it to be closer to $0.40 a foot and then we would expect in '14 it would be at an even be lower level.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a question for Lisa on guidance. How much redevelopment investment is embedded in guidance, if any? And where do you guys see the most opportunity for redevelopment in your portfolio?","Lisa Palmer","I'll let Brian address the opportunities. We expect that we should be able to do up to about $15 million of redevelopments per year. We'd love to do more but all the stars have to align for that to happen, and so really difficult to get done. But I'll still let Brian talk about what we have coming this year.","Brian M. Smith","This year, we may -- in 2013, we've already got the one going for $8 million, and that's just an example of an older center. This is typical where we're actually going to get over $700,000 of increased revenue from the redevelopment of 2 anchors. We turned down a Walgreens, we turned a Publix in rebuilding. We've also got the Balboa Mesa redevelopment coming, which we acquired last year. And then, I guess, the source going forward as Lisa said, you probably figured there's maybe $15 million that would come from the existing portfolio. But we also have the additional phases of a lot of the developments that when we went in the -- since 2009, we rightsized them. For example, later this year, we would hope to expand the Lee Airport Park in Annapolis, which is 100% leased or close to it. And then we've got the expansion of the Golden Hills property in California. So, and then one other one we'd likely to do at the end of this year would be Woodway Collection where the anchor is at the end of its term and we'll replace the anchor and do a full redevelopment.","Martin E. Stein","And also, I want to amplify that a little bit and connect the dots back to Andrew's question about CapEx. The anticipated amount of starts from a redevelopment where we have visible, attractive returns on invested capital is in the neighborhood of $15 million. And that absolutely is a top priority, to the extent we can expand that, that would be great. But we've also, and I think we break that out separately, but we anticipate spending about another $15 million a year over and above routine building improvements where we think that we can enhance the look of the shopping center, do a facade redo and that we think that although the returns aren't immediately visible, that we would expect we're going to get at an even higher lift from our growth and net operating income.","Lisa Palmer","And to clarify from a disclosure standpoint, the expansions and redevelopments that Brian was speaking about, we do disclose in our developments status page and we have it down at the bottom. So any expansions that we would do of existing centers would show there, would not be part of the CapEx disclosure. The major renovation CapEx disclosure is on a separate page, but we also -- but we do disclose both in detail.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We go next to Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Lisa, I just want to go back to your answer on the Whole Foods being included in -- as the development profit at the Whole Foods sale. My understanding is that the Whole Foods itself opened in '09, so how does it end up qualifying as a merchant building gain at the end '12?","Lisa Palmer","We've -- it was -- some -- it was completed and moved into the operating portfolio in 4Q of 2011. And so basically, our internal policy -- is if it's sold within 1 year of completion, it would be included in the gain. Remember, Cedrik, we do exclude it from core FFO.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So, so it was built [ph]. So I guess I misread that somewhere. So it was open in 2011.","Lisa Palmer","I was -- we completed it at...","Brian M. Smith","We said that one of the other things is although right now, it's just the Whole Foods, the original intent of that, there was an office building on the corner and we were planning on redeveloping that. Either tearing it down, converting it to a drugstore or something like putting out another pad out there. And the entitlement process in Santa Barbara is an incredibly burdensome and lengthy one. And finally, what we ended up doing is selling off the property. So all we were left with, was the Whole Foods, which then went into the operating portfolio.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that works. And then in regards to the redevelopment discussion from earlier. How much of that redevelopment spend contributes to same-store NOI growth, let's say, in 2013? Does it account for 50 basis points of the 2% to 3%? Can you try to give me a range in there?","Lisa Palmer","I don't -- I'm not sure -- I'll have to get back to you on '13. In '12, it was -- I think, I believe it was about 20 basis points. Because just as -- remember, Brian talked about it, he gave Woodway as an example. That's one, where we're going to have the anchor down for a period of time. So at the same time that your getting the benefit of those that you're completing, you're being -- you're having the dilution from those that you're taking off-line. We're happy to give you that number. I'll follow-up.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. No problem. And I guess final question. Have you been using the ATM in the fourth quarter?","Lisa Palmer","We did not use it in the fourth quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was just curious to get your updated thoughts on SUPERVALU and Fresh & Easy. And kind of how you are you guys thinking about those situations?","Brian M. Smith","Well, Fresh & Easy, we assume they're gone. So we're actively in discussions with people, with replacement tenants for those spaces. Unfortunately, we've only got 2 operating and they're both in Northern California and they should be -- there's a lot of demand for those spaces. SUPERVALU, as I kind of indicated in the remarks, really no change. I think we said last quarter that having looked at all the properties, looked at what we could do with them if we got all the spaces back. We felt there are only a handful of ones that might take some time to release. Since then we met with the representatives who share with us their -- the profitability and the sales for all the stores and they were literally just a few that were either at breakeven or at a loss. And one of those is the term expires in 2015 and the rent to $2.60 a foot, so we're more than happy to get that one back. Another one is adjacent to a large retailer who would want to expand in that space. So honestly, there's just a couple, I think, that could be -- we just feel as comfortable as we can be that we're not going to be impacted that much.","Martin E. Stein","And just in general, I think, as Brian indicated earlier, we're not involved based upon that kind of secondhand knowledge which we are following very closely. The operators of Albertsons have done a good job with that chain, the SUPERVALU people and investors are pretty optimistic about what they can do with the chain. It obviously still is a very competitive industry, it remains to be seen. But I do think that there's a better chance for a turnaround. And there's a lot more clarity there.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And actually, just to circle back on Deer Springs. I guess, my question before is -- I was maybe more surprised by the magnitude of the write-down, just I was surprised that it wouldn't have been tripped before because it's a pretty substantial write-down when you think of it, particularly on a per square foot value relative to the size of the asset. Has that something to do with where you guys think Las Vegas retail is currently valued?","Lisa Palmer","I could go into a much longer discussion on an accounting education, but I don't -- I think it would bore you. But you're adding [ph] impairment, there has to be a trigger basically in this to evaluate, to reevaluate for an impairment and the trigger here was the fact that we believe it's going to be more likely than not that we're going to sell it. That was what changed.","Brian M. Smith","The other thing, Jeff, about it, what's interesting is when this was originally underwritten, it was underwritten to be a 700,000 square-foot property. And when the market turned, we built only what was under construction, and that was only 330,000 square feet. So there's 370,000 square feet that didn't even get built for about 37 acres worth of coverage, and I think that's one of the reasons why you're seeing such a big impairment.","Martin E. Stein","And just to reiterate, it is not consistent with our in-fill disciplined future development strategy.","Operator","We'll go next to Nathan Isbee with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Brian, can you give a little more detail on the expected 4Q moveouts that didn't occur? Were those tenants close to maturity just re-upped? Or were those the tenants that decided to hang on?","Brian M. Smith","They were tenants that appear to have decided to hang on. That's just -- the moveouts are always the hardest thing for us to plan on. We go through space by space and we take a look at what the property managers are saying based on the feedback from talking to the retailers. We look at what we want to do, we look at their sales. At the end of the day, in the fourth quarter, they just did not move out. Now, we wonder does that mean they're going to move out first quarter, and first quarter is not done so I don't have answer for you. But you would think that if they're going to go, they would limp through the holidays, extract as much sales as they could and then move out. But I would tell you right now that the January numbers indicate that they have not moved out and we are way ahead of plan in terms of moveouts for January.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. But you are assuming in your '13 guidance that they do move out at some point?","Brian M. Smith","Yes.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just -- can you remind...","Lisa Palmer","I mean that's in the range we are, right? I mean, if that's what the same property growth of 2% to 3% would assume that -- I mean, that has a range of moveout but as well as our percent lease.","Brian M. Smith","We didn't change that.","Lisa Palmer","Right. And since I have the floor, and I have a really good team that e-mailed me the impact on redevelopment growth in '13. To answer Cedrik's question, it is approximately 20 basis points.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just update us on the same space rent growth assumptions in your guidance? I noticed you took it out of the supplemental.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. We didn't provide exact guidance even at our investor meeting in December. It's one of the most difficult things to forecast, but if you'll recall, at that time, Brian did indicate that we would expect that we would be in the mid- to high-single digits for 2013. There's more pricing power, so that would put us at slightly better than 2012.","Operator","We go next to Samit Parikh with ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions, really, on funding. One, I know, I think, someone asked did you use the ATM in 4Q, can you tell us if you use any of the ATM in 1Q so far?","Lisa Palmer","It would be a blackout period.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Oh yes, that's true. Okay, fair. Also, you sold the Whole Foods, right, that you the opened in 2009 and given sort of where cap rates are right now for this type of grocer, either single tenant or small grocery anchored centers and Publix buying everything they can. Do you think sort of selling maybe some of these assets that you developed, call it between 2006 and 2008, you have several of these smaller grocer anchor assets that may have some limited near-term growth, is a better funding strategy near-term than maybe using the ATM to fund your development?","Lisa Palmer","Possibly, yes. And in fact, that clearly -- the sale of Paseo del Sol was an opportunistic sale because of -- that it was a cheaper cost of capital than selling our equity at the time, and that's why it's not a coincidence that we didn't tap the equity market in the fourth quarter.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Are you current -- are you in discussions right now? I mean, is there a discussion going on maybe with Publix or some of the other centers of Whole Foods? And are you seeing some sort of an updig [ph] increase in the appetite of maybe net lease investors to pay lower than your current cost -- lower than your current and pi [ph] cap rate type of cap rates for some of these assets that you'd be willing to part with?","Lisa Palmer","No, not necessarily. And -- but I'll also remind you, too, that we do have this 3% that Brian talked about, which at this time, is a higher priority than some of the limited growth assets. But to the extent that we can sell the limited growth assets in lieu of tapping the equity markets, that's something that we will consider.","Martin E. Stein","But we would not, just to be clear, we wouldn't sell the primary anchor in the shopping center because we think that's important to the long-term value even though that primary anchor obviously has less growth potential than the side shop and\/or some of the secondary anchors.","Operator","With no additional questions in queue, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any additional or closing comments.","Martin E. Stein","We appreciate your time and interest in Regency and wish everybody have a great day and a great Super Bowl weekend. Thank you very much.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's call. Again, thank you for your participation. Have a good day."],"18586":["Regency Centers (NASDAQ:REG) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  8, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Lisa Palmer","Martin E.

This conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, Lisa Palmer. You may begin.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Anna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.","On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Brian Smith, Bruce Johnson and Chris Leavitt. Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these statements. Please refer to the documents filed -- excuse me, filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today.","Let me start by saying that while our properties in the northeast experienced relatively minor damage from Sandy, we know the losses to many have been great. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were caught in the storm's path.","Turning now to Regency's results. I continue to be encouraged by the impressive progress the team has made so far this year in all aspects of the business. With the risk of stealing the thunder from Bruce and Brian, let me provide a quick recap. Fundamentals in the operating portfolio and demand from retailers remain strong. As evidenced by our results this quarter, we enhanced the portfolio's NOI growth, strategic and risk profiles through the sale of lower quality assets, using the proceeds to reduce leverage, as well as acquire dominant A-quality shopping centers with superior growth prospects. The large amount of sales so far this year has substantially reduced the remaining asset centers that we have prioritized for sale. This means that in the future, we expect dispositions will be more modest in scale.","Our 7 in-process developments continue to perform extremely well, featuring significant leasing progress and attractive returns. I feel that our ability to create value through development and redevelopment of dominant centers is an important core competency. And while progress continues to be made, fortifying our solid balance sheet and access to capital, we will continue to take advantage of cost-effective opportunities for enhancement.","In summary, I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments and gratified by our results. And in no way do I underestimate the challenges and risks presented by today's fragile economy and financial markets. You should know that despite the uncertainties we face, I feel that Regency Centers is well positioned to sustain growth and shareholder value through the following strategic assets. Number one, our portfolio of dominant in-fill shopping centers that will produce reliable growth and net operating income. Number two, the strength of our balance sheet and cost-effective access to capital. Number three, disciplined value-add development capabilities. And last but definitely not least, our engaged and talented team. Bruce?","Bruce M. Johnson","Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone.","As Hap stated, our third quarter results were very good. Core FFO was $0.62 per share, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range. Year-to-date, same-property NOI has grown 4% and continues to exceed projections. Roughly 80% of NOI growth came from increased base rent. In response of these positive results, as well as our forecast for the final 3 months of the year, we are raising guidance for 2012. Core FFO is being raised by $0.05 at the midpoint to a new range of $2.48 to $2.52. And same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, is now 3.6% to 4.1%.","Before sharing our initial 2013 guidance with you, I'd like to remind you that we expect a significant -- to be a significant net seller this year, enabling us to reduce our total debt by approximately $170 million. Assuming a 6% spread between the cost of interest and the cap rate on dispositions, we have estimated full year impact to 2013 is roughly $0.11 of dilution. To that end, 2013 core FFO guidance is $2.45 to $2.53. In the future, we don't expect to be a net seller. Therefore, we would expect growth in 2014 and beyond to be in the 5% range.","Turning to capital markets. We are committed to maintaining an already-sound balance sheet and opportunistically strengthening it even further. Let me recap the transactions we completed during the third quarter, all of which were in line with that goal.","In August, we raised $75 million of Series 7 Preferred Stock at an annual dividend rate of 6%. We used those proceeds to redeem all outstanding shares of our Series 5 issuance, providing a permanent dividend savings of approximately $525,000 every year. In September, we expanded our revolving credit facility to a capacity of $800 million and extended its maturity date by 1 year to September 2017, including the extension option. In addition to our revolving credit facility, we also retain the right to draw the remaining $100 million on our term loan, which expires in mid-January 2013. Together, these bank facilities provide $900 million of capacity. We are monitoring our net commitments as it relates to these facilities to ensure significant capacity remains to provide Regency with sleep-at-night security. And finally, during the quarter, we sold nearly $22 million of stock through our ATM program, at an average price of $49.70.","Now, Brian will provide more color behind our operating results and development successes.","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning. This quarter, we saw a continuation of the improved fundamentals that we discussed in prior quarters. We leased 1.5 millions square feet of space in the operating portfolio, nearly 1\/3 of which was new leases. Net absorption was positive, and we ended the quarter at 94.3% leased and 87.4% leased for spaces under 10,000 square feet. Likewise, the pipeline of leasing activity remains strong and above our historical average, maintaining solid interest in our vacant spaces. This robust leasing performance has been the primary source of our same-property NOI growth this year, with base shrink contributing roughly 80% of the increase. The growth in NOI was broad-based across the portfolio.","Looking forward, as we approach and exceed 95% leased, core NOI growth will have to come from rent growth than from occupancy gains. This quarter, we continue to see evidence of pricing power beginning to gain traction, as rent growth is positive 13.7% for the quarter and positive 6.1% year-to-date.","Much of the rent growth this quarter was due to a handful of leases for large boxes. Even without these, rent growth was over 4% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date, with 80% of our leases showing positive rent growth.","Turning to our developments. Our $240 million of in-process projects are performing extremely well, registering an average incremental return of more than 9% or nearly 80% leased, creating $75 million of value at today's implied cap rate.","The interest in these projects has been remarkable. For example, take Grand Ridge Plaza in Metro Seattle. Today the project is 79% leased. With an additional -- with additional leasing activity that is signed, would take it to 95% leased, well ahead of the estimated June 2013 completion date. Also, I want to briefly comment on our capital recycling progress. In addition to the portfolio sale, we sold 3 operating properties during the third quarter. First State Plaza, shop rate anchorage [ph] center in Stanton, Delaware and Brentwood Commons in Baker Hill Center, both dominant anchored [ph] centers outside of Chicago.","As with the portfolio sale, these properties were deemed inconsistent with our investment strategy and expectations for NOI growth.","We acquired one truly outstanding shopping center this quarter, Balboa Mesa, located in San Diego, California. Anchored by Vons, CVS and Kohl's, Balboa Mesa is exceptional in-fill real estate located at one of the busiest intersections in San Diego. With embedded contractual rent growth and very compelling immediate redevelopment opportunity, not only will the stabilized return be around 6%, but we also expect to see very good growth from that point forward.","In summary, the third quarter was very much a continuation of the progress that was made during the first half of the year. All aspects of our plan are coming together nicely and producing desirable results. Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Brian. As you know, Bruce will be retiring as Regency's Chief Financial Officer at the end of the year, and this will be his last participation on a Regency earnings call. So before we turn the call over to questions, I'd like to take a moment to say a few words about Bruce. He is Regency's consummate Chief Financial Officer. He's been an extraordinary leader, by word and deed. He's been my life's partner and a wonderful friend. He's played a vital role in Regency's success, and especially epitomized our culture and everything that is good and great about Regency. As many of you who are on this call know from investor dinners, Bruce has a great sense of humor, to say the least. He's always unpredictable and keeps things light. More importantly, he's Mr. Perspective. He knows what is important in work and in life. Bruce, to say that we will miss you is an unbelievable understatement. However, we are comforted that your legacy will continue to guide us and that you are only a phone call away. We thank you and know that you'll enjoy and fare well in your retirement. And Bruce, your 34 years, at a minimum, entitles you the last word today.","Bruce M. Johnson","Thank you, Hap. I'm humbled by your comments. However, when you offer the last word in this group, you need to take advantage of it. This December marks 34 wonderful years that I've worked with my good friend and partner, Hap. He's been a wise leader and an incredible role model, and a personality that everyone loves. Our relationship has been very special, and I can't imagine a better 34 years. Brian and I started working together following the Pacific Retail Trust merger in 1999. But it wasn't until they moved to Jacksonville 5 years ago that I've really gotten to know him. Like Hap, he has also been a good friend and partner. His vast knowledge of and experience with shopping centers, his work ethic and his inspirational leadership set him apart in our industry. And 16 years ago, hired Lisa Palmer and we are fortunate with that decision. During her many roles at Regency, she has continued to perform like a star. Most recently, as you know, in Investor Relations and Capital Markets. I admit to feeling like a proud father as she assumes my role. As many of you know, Regency has a great culture, with an upbeat and fun family atmosphere. And in my view, it also has the best associates in the business. They are smart, professional, and important in sustaining our culture. It goes without saying that I will miss the daily interaction with the Regency family.","Over the last 19 years, I've been privileged to know and work with a very talented and sharp group of investors, analysts and investment bankers. Many of you are on the call this morning. A lot of you were young when I first met you, some very, very young. I have enjoyed watching you grow, develop and progress in your roles as you have assumed more responsibility, moved to other firms and maybe back again, gained the respect of the industry, and yes, I even enjoyed your asking Regency and other REITs those difficult analyst investor questions. I will also miss the interplay with you. In 2013 and beyond, I look forward to watching Hap, Brian and Lisa take Regency to the next level.","Hap alluded to my propensity to ask table questions. I won't have a question this morning, but as I turn the call over for your questions, I will leave you with a favorite 3-letter acronym. Q-T-R. Or, as Lisa prefers, QT. For those who know what that means, it's something to think about.","And with that, we'll take questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Samit Parikh.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just circle back to, Bruce, your comment on the 5% long-term earnings growth 2015 and beyond. Can you quickly just go through the drivers on that? I know part of it is being net acquires, but one thing I'm wondering is your funding plans on both developments, redevelopments, the size of that every year, and what you're thinking long-term and the funding plans in terms of how to fund the acquisitions going forward.","Bruce M. Johnson","It's actually 3 questions. I'm going to actually turn that over to Lisa, because that will all be on Lisa's watch.","Lisa Palmer","I think he enjoyed doing that. Yes, if you think about our business model, we've communicated in the past and we'll continue to be committed to development. We'd like to average approximately $150 million in new starts every year. And in terms of funding that, as you know, we've been an active capital recycler. We would also like to continue to do that, also in the $150 million range for acquisitions and dispositions. To the extent that -- and also, as you know, we did implement an ATM. We filed it in August. To the extent that we're able to access the equity market at an attractive price to match fund our developments, we will do that. If that's not available to us, then our disposition proceeds would fund our development commitments first, and acquisitions would follow, only to the extent that we have the available capital. So if you think about the 5% growth, if you average 2.5% same-property growth, average that, and then get the incremental growth from the developments that are coming online, because we're developing them on a very accretive basis, that will get you into the 5% range.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And how do you think about G&A growth on top of all that annually as you're expanding the asset base?","Lisa Palmer","I think that we plan to monitor G&A very closely, and we would expect that G&A shouldn't increase more than 3% a year.","Bruce M. Johnson","As a matter of fact, we'd be growing our earnings -- our top line and bottom line at higher rates than our G&A is growing.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Bruce, certainly wish you all the best and it's been great having you in 34 years. I have a question about guidance, both as we look into the fourth quarter and also into next year. Can you help to sort of walk through, if you did $0.62 in the third quarter, you're looking at $0.55 to $0.59 in the fourth. And I guess I was surprised by that sort of drop-off. I recognized you sold the assets in I think it was late July, so there's a little bit of drag from that. But typically your percentage rents will come up a little bit, your rents are doing well, your occupancy is high, your recovery rate is within -- in the average. So I guess the decline is a lot more than I would have thought sequentially, and so maybe you can just walk through how you get from today down to the midpoint. And then as we move into next year, especially with no sort of sales, I'm not sure how you get to the low end, or what's driving that sort of low end of guidance. It would seem that you should be able to be in excess, and Lisa, I know you want to beat in your first year as a CFO, but maybe you can just sort of help us reconcile those things?","Lisa Palmer","Sure. The first part, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we talked on the call about being a net seller and reducing leverage by -- in the prepared remarks rather, for about $170 million. But if you look at our guidance for the remainder of the year, you'll see that we're still expecting some acquisitions to come through. So the amount that we're a net seller at this point in time is actually much greater than that. So that has more of a drag on the earnings, and that we're expecting the acquisitions to happen later in the fourth quarter. So that will get you to the difference in third quarter to fourth quarter, and then also helps for the run rate for next year. To the extent that we're able to execute on those acquisitions, that NOI will come online. In addition to that, 3% NOI growth is about $12 million a year. And so that will also -- we're going to begin to see leases commence rent paying, and we're going to see that growth take hold in 2013.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So in terms of we're sitting here in the first week of November, how much -- you have $145 million, I guess, at the higher end, $150 million of additional sales baked into the fourth quarter, and upwards of $150 million of acquisitions. I mean, when did that $150 million get sold for it to be such -- we're talking about a $0.07 -- a $0.05 sequential drag, 3Q to 4Q? It seems like a pretty big drop.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. I mean you just take the -- I mean, if you just assume that it happens in the middle of the quarter, which should be in the middle of this month, now that we're already in November.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right so do you have $150 million that are sort of ready to be closed in a week?","Lisa Palmer","We have, actually, about $120 million that are expected on the market. Whether they actually close, I cannot predict that.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So it wouldn't seem that the guidance is conservative, then? At least into the fourth quarter?","Lisa Palmer","If it happens, then it would not be conservative. It would be within the range. And unfortunately, I'm not able to predict at this time, if it all will happen. So we have to give a range of expectations. And that's, therefore, why we have a low end and a high end. Now, to the extent that we don't execute on the dispositions, then we would be towards the higher end of the range. And if we do, then we would be more towards the middle to the -- potentially the lower end.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Joseph Dazio with JPMorgan.","Joseph C. Dazio - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wondering if you could talk specifically about what drove the $0.03 upside to the top end of the range in the third quarter?","Lisa Palmer","It's basically all -- 80% of it was NOI, even in the same-property growth. Same-property growth was above our guidance for the quarter and also above our expectations.","Joseph C. Dazio - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And was that a function of I guess the rents being up fairly notably on some of the new leases that hit in the quarter? Or was it something else that caused that?","Lisa Palmer","No, I mean when you think about rent spreads, the impact of those don't happen immediately. What -- you may want to check how other companies do it, I think there's a mixed bag. We report spreads at execution of the lease, not necessarily at rent commencement. I think -- I do believe that's what the majority of our peers do. There's some that may report it at rent commencement. The primary driver of the upside was better leasing than expected and fewer move-outs.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just to stay on the theme of NOI. Can you give me a sense of what is the gap between lease space and occupied space this quarter versus what it was last quarter?","Bruce M. Johnson","Cedrik, leased space and rent-paying? It was -- is 200 basis points, and that's 50 basis points better than it was last quarter.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So you were 250 last quarter, and now you're 200 this quarter?","Bruce M. Johnson","That's right.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just completely different track here, next question. In regards to land values, as you think about development, as you go out there and try to acquire land, what do you think has happened to land values over the past year?","Bruce M. Johnson","I don't -- it depends on the market. In California, coastal California, I don't think land values have really fallen that much at all. And other markets, if you're in secondary markets, tertiary markets, I think they clearly have fallen. So in the places where we're looking, we still see land values fairly high.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if you were to compare it versus the past 12 months, have land values changed or they've just been stable for an extended period of time?","Bruce M. Johnson","I think they've been pretty stable. What's happening is you are seeing some cost increases on the -- construction costs, both materials and labor, by about 10% in the last 18 months or so. And then what you're also seeing on developments is yields compressing. There aren't that many good opportunities out there, and those that are ready to go, I think you're -- we're seeing some pretty intense competition.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First thing, I'd like to, Bruce, add my congratulations. And my first question is actually for you. If I wanted a good bottle of red wine, what would you recommend?","Bruce M. Johnson","I would never suggest a good bottle of red wine without you buying wine away at the same time, Rich.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And I don't know Lisa if you're going to be give me 2 more questions on top of that or just one, so I'll ask this one first. On the small subleasing front, you guys are obviously making some pretty good progress. Is that coming, you think, more from actual leasing? Or is it the sale of assets that have more small shop vacancy? And then going forward, do you think you'll be selling some small shop vacancy as well?","Bruce M. Johnson","Well, this year, our gain -- this quarter our gain in occupancy was from the capital recycling. But we're 200 basis points up quarter-to-quarter in the small shop -- I'm sorry year-to-year. And last quarter if you'd measure, I think we were 280 basis points higher. So it's coming from real leasing. As you know, the first 3 quarters of this year is the best leasing we've ever done. Last year was a record at the time as well. So it's real strong demand. The tenant sales are very good, their optimism is back. The lack of new supply is certainly helping us, so it's genuine demand, Rich.","Martin E. Stein","And then a follow up on that. We've studied what have been the ingredients of successful shopping centers and the amount of side shop space to up-and-down markets has not been an issue for the better shopping centers, the A centers that have performed better. So we want to own shopping centers where we're not afraid of the shop space and we think we can merchandise it, and where we think we're going to have merchandising and pricing power on a go-forward basis.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay so going forward, Hap and Brian, I would assume you're saying that you think the small shop leasing will actually continue to be -- should steady?","Brian M. Smith","Yes.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then the second question I have is on the grocery store business. I mean you guys have any thoughts, maybe broader thoughts on what you're seeing with grocers, and how you view the grocery business right now?","Bruce M. Johnson","I think that the grocery business is extremely competitive. The traditional supermarkets that aren't dominant in their market are not doing well and they're losing share, obviously, to Wal-Mart, to Costco, to the higher end supermarket, et cetera. So our focus is threefold. Number one, it's the dominant kind of traditional supermarket, it's got a dominant share like a Publix in Florida, even Safeway in California. So we look at that, Kroger in a lot of markets. Then secondly, the upper-end supermarkets, grocery stores, especially supermarkets like Whole Foods, like Trader Joe's. In both cases that are generating -- very productive in generating a significant amount of sales. And then thirdly, the locations, and most important of all locations it is, as Brian says, if something bad happens, we're the going to get the space back and be able to release it to a better operator.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So overall, you feel pretty good about your grocery exposure at this point?","Bruce M. Johnson","Yes, but it is something that we watch very rigorously and monitor all the time. It's a changing landscape, but we feel in general very good about our real estate and\/or our operators.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Apologies if I missed this in your earlier comments. Could you explain why the 2013 projected development completions, the amount was revised downward a little bit?","Lisa Palmer","I mean -- I don't know the exact project that may have fallen out. But I'm happy, Paula, to get back to you on that. I mean the only thing I can think is if we pulled something forward, if this 2012 came up because our developments are performing well in-line with expectations. In fact they're also exceeding expectations, so we'll -- I'll get back to you on that.","Bruce M. Johnson","And that very well could have happened.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on the first question about G&A, maybe just to ask it a little bit differently. How scalable do you think the existing platform is? How much in -- how much could you grow the asset base without a substantial investment in -- at the corporate level?","Bruce M. Johnson","We can meaningfully grow the asset base without a meaningful growth in P&A.","Lisa Palmer","I'm sorry let me just come back to you. I do have the guidance page in front of me, and that's exactly what happened. We actually increased completions for 2012, so we brought 1 forward.","Bruce M. Johnson","And as Lisa said our developments are performing extremely well.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And can you just kind of quantify what meaningful means? Is it -- could you double the portfolio or 50% or...","Bruce M. Johnson","Well, I think that it's a very scalable business, and I think we could easily grow it by 20%, 25% with de minimis increases in G&A. And we're not looking although if we can grow smartly and in a way that's going to grow NAV, it's something we'd like to do. But as far as growth for growth sake, it's not an important objective here, but I would say that we feel that we have the capacity to grow very efficiently. Especially -- and you can look at our footprint and the fact that we have 17 offices throughout the country, we're well postured throughout the country to build on that platform. If the right opportunities, both on the investment side and on the finance side, present themselves.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jim Sullivan with Cowen.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First, I wanted to make comment to Bruce. Bruce, we've worked together for a long time. You've always been an absolutely great guy to work with. I think you're a class act and we're certainly going to miss harassing you every 90 days or so, so make sure you stay in touch. And I have a couple of questions I guess for Brian and Lisa. First of all, Brian, when you talked about the leasing business in the quarter, you cited a couple of transactions that were a little unusual but helped to drive that rent spread. I'm just curious, and I think when you've commented about that, you talk about large boxes and I'm just curious whether -- where we are in terms of coming off the bottom. I mean, back a year or 2 ago, there was obviously a lot of large box vacancies you had to fill and a lot of that has been done and there's been some commentary that some of the weakness in development starts was the result of large box availability that was out there. I'm just curious if you feel pretty confident that given the increases in occupancy rates across your portfolio and the industry as a whole, that we're going to see perhaps, I don't want to say material, but maybe a meaningful increase in development starts as you work -- as you look out over the next year and what the implications are for yields on [indiscernible].","Brian M. Smith","I must the last part, Jim, could you -- the outlook for what?","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","The outlook for the yields on development. Obviously, you've had -- a number of the big boxes we've been hearing at ICSC conferences and otherwise, have been reluctant to step up and pay the kind of rents that you guys need in order to get acceptable yields on development. And that was especially the case given that there was a lot of vacancy to be had in the first case. So now that, that vacancy has pretty much been eliminated or has back down to more historical levels, are the tenants feeling confident enough about their business to step up to the kind of rents you need to get acceptable yields and ramp-up your development?","Brian M. Smith","Well, let me start with our portfolio. We only have 10 boxes left, and it totals about 300,000 square feet. So when you look at ours and you look at in the bigger picture, I think what you're seeing here is a microcosm of what's happening in the -- across the country is that the top space is gone and what we have left is -- we're going to have to -- is going to take a little bit longer to get through that. Because of that, you are seeing the boxes looking for external growth that they -- because they haven't been able to get the same kind of growth as they had from taking second generation space. I think a good example of that is Dick's. Dick's has always been one of those operators that took second generation space and we're doing several deals with them in first generation space. The issue is where will they do and what will they pay and they really go hand-in-hand. The only place they're going to pay the rents that can support new development are where they can generate the sales and that's more in the urban areas. So I think that's really the governor right now, is keeping development down. There's just -- I mean not only are developers having trouble with financing the equity requirements, but new development requires, to your point, the kind of rents, and those rents can only be generated not in the secondary and tertiary markets. So I don't think you're going to see a big explosion of development at all, at least that in the next 12 to 18 months.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","To what extent also -- kind of a follow-up on the same question, the ability to do Greenfield developments in new housing communities, to what extent as we've began to see a ramp in single-family permitting, does that lead you to maybe be a little more confident, as well that on that side of the development opportunity spectrum you'll have more opportunities over the next year or 2?","Brian M. Smith","I think what you'll see in emerging residential markets is we'll only probably do it the way we're doing it at Grand Ridge and Cinco Ranch, where those are master-planned communities with high barriers to entry, extremely high at Grand Ridge, and they've already got enough homes to support the retail, which I think is a different approach than happened at the peak of the market when people started tying up the retail land and building on the anticipation of those homes coming. And Jim the question I didn't answer that you asked earlier was the outlook on returns and I would say for the kind of places we're looking to build, the -- I would say the norm is probably in the 8.5% range, which is still probably about 60% profit margin given exit cap rates.","Bruce M. Johnson","[indiscernible] it's obviously, a little lower than that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to come back to the rental rate growth guidance given. Obviously, there was a big swing in part due to the big increase in the third quarter of 13.7%. But has something changed in the last 90 days to give you and your team more confidence in pushing rents? Have you reached an inflection point in occupancy?","Brian M. Smith","We have in some markets I think 60% of our markets we're now 95% leased or more. And I think things are trending the right way for us with that 95% occupancy in those markets, we're gaining more pricing power as supply demand tightens. We've now got 6 quarters in a row of positive rent growth and as Hap mentioned 80% of our markets -- in 80% of our leases had positive rent growth. This quarter was unusually strong. It's unusual that we would find that many anchor leases with the kind of growth that we had. Those were all really in anticipation of redevelopments, but even without those, we were positive, as I said, low-to-mid 4% range and our shop space was positive. So I don't think there's a massive change. I think it continues to be an improvement in the fundamentals and going forward, I think you would expect to see rent growth in the next 12 months, probably in the mid-single-digit range.","Bruce M. Johnson","Yes. I think we're kind of halfway there, mid single-digit growth on our way to 10% rent growth hopefully maybe not next year, but hopefully the following year in 2014.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then last quarter you talked about strategic move out, does that continue to be a part of your strategy?","Brian M. Smith","It's definitely a part of the strategy and we're exercising it far more often than we have in the past. As occupancy tightens up, and as the demand continues to be strong, wherever we've got those placeholders, as we call them, that we've put in there -- when we gave them rent concessions, we are moving them out when we have a tenant that we view as a significant upgrade in quality and\/or quality. Lots of examples of that this quarter. Quiznos has been a struggling chain and we got rid of several of them in the portfolio this quarter. An example, with Hollymead we replaced them with a better operator and the sales are 5x higher. We did it in many other locations where we not only got better operators, but we've got a nice double-digit rent growth.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are -- just looking over to dispositions. Of the $120 million that seem to be on the cuff [ph] for sale or being marketed, what -- are those being sold individually or is that a portfolio?","Brian M. Smith","Those are being sold individually.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then your recovery rate has been ticking up each quarter and now sits above the guidance range for the year. What should we expect going forward?","Lisa Palmer","Remember, I think we've told you all in the past that as occupancy increases, we basically see a like increase in recovery rates. And also credit to our team, we've done some things that haven't allowed us to increase our recovery rate and hopefully our tenants are not listening. So I think that you would see we're from an up -- from a same-property recovery rate, we're in the high -- we're close to 78% and we would expect to maintain that.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So you will be above the guidance range that's in your supplement?","Lisa Palmer","Again, if you will consider there's been an improvement each quarter and the range is 76% to 78%. I'm talking same-property only. And we would expect to continue to see that strong recovery rate. Within the range.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the disposition question. Just sounds like you're selling -- the rest of what you're selling this year is individual assets. Just wondering what you're seeing as far as the sweet spots for demand for sort of non-core assets. In terms of geography as well sort of the size of the assets, and that kind of thing.","Brian M. Smith","Did you say for non-core assets?","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right.","Brian M. Smith","Really what people want is in the BS is they're looking for returns. So what they're hoping to do is to be able to buy them at, say, 7% on existing income, 8% on existing income and then if they can get that up to 9% through releasing, then they're real happy. So I think the pricing is typically -- depends on the quality, but anywhere from the higher end of the B spectrum, maybe 7% and at the lower end, maybe 8%. And then in terms of markets, we're -- I don't really see that much of a difference. We don't have anything in places like Arkansas and stuff like that, so I think there's pretty much -- people are looking for opportunities in any markets.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then in terms of the total size of the deal value, I mean is it like a $50 million is a sweet spot, a little bit less than that?","Brian M. Smith","I'd say it's less than that, although when you look at who we've been selling to, we've been selling to private buyers, private REITs, pension fund advisors, investment advisors and other retailers. You've got 2 properties we've sold now to grocers. So it all depends. Obviously, the pension funds would probably look to put out more money, the private buyers would be looking at more in the probably $20 million, $25 million range.","Bruce M. Johnson","And one of the key things, what's financeable, and I would say that so-called commodity product of what's available for financing from a CMBS standpoint has expanded meaningfully, maybe not dramatically.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful and just one last question on the quarter. I know we've talked about it a lot and most the upside, sounds like it's coming from better operating performance, but I just wanted to confirm. Were there any expense items in the quarter that might not be recurring going forward, true-ups that kind of thing?","Lisa Palmer","No, nothing out of the ordinary.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now move to Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Bruce, congratulations and I'm sure you'll enjoy the Q-T-R as you move into the next phase of your life. I guess I had a question -- you guys talked a lot about the leasing spreads so I'll kind of turn my attention maybe more to just kind of the acquisitions and really the institutional kind of partner market. You guys have a lot of different institutional ventures and we've seen other companies be able to take advantage of those as kind of built-in acquisitions opportunities. And I'm just wondering what kind of discussions you might be having with the existing partners, as to their kind of exit plans and if you thought some of those might materialize sooner rather than later?","Lisa Palmer","I'll take that. When you think about our partners, we really have a few really major partners. We've got GRI, which is First Washington, and CalPERS. And we have CalSTRS state of Oregon, they're our really -- they're our most significant partners and every single one of them have the same objective of holding real estate long-term as we do. They may be in a recycling mode, for example, Oregon, has, again, similar to the Regency strategy. The other 2 would like to grow rather than be a source of acquisitions for Regency. We do have the [indiscernible] properties and we had talked earlier about potentially selling those even this year and it's been decided that we're going to hold those for at least, call it the medium-term. So there are no opportunities at this time, for us to grow through acquiring properties through any of our partnerships. And if anything we may incrementally grow those that have the demand. If you'll recall from a couple of quarters ago, CalSTRS recently committed an additional $100 million of equity to us, which is a vote of confidence in our partnership.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well I guess that kind of leads to maybe the second question. Just what -- kind of what is their appetite, Lisa? And have their return hurdles changed? What kind of product and what kind of returns are they asking you to kind of look for? What's in their wheelhouse today?","Lisa Palmer","Exactly what Regency would be looking for and as we've had conversations in the past, we are -- we have a rotation basis, if you will, for acquisition opportunities and we are obligated to show our acquisition opportunities to CalSTRS and to the state of Oregon, and then Regency would be the third in that rotation. And to the extent that, for example, we bought Lake Grove earlier this year, to the extent that maybe it's a larger asset or a new market, we may look to one of our other partners to co-invest with us, but that's at our option. And we did do that with GRI for that asset. But to the extent of what they're looking for, their objectives are aligned with ours. So our acquisitions team is out there in the market and they have the same mandate and it's blind to who will be the actual applier of that.","Bruce M. Johnson","And having consistency of that purpose we think makes it a lot easier on our acquisition team and our management and leasing teams.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So, Lisa, if I can just ask you to be a little more specific financially, like kind of range of cap rates or IRR hurdles would be what for those kind of institutional partners?","Lisa Palmer","Steve, if you can call them and ask them and get them to give you a number, we'd love it. They're actually -- I mean they're never that specific, right? Real estate is going to depend on each and every asset, but if you think about what we've talked about, we're looking at -- well, look at our -- the asset we just bought in Southern California in San Diego. It was going in approximately a 5%, but with the potential redevelopment, well, the actual redevelopment, we're going to be able to grow that, stabilize yields close to 6%, an incremental return on capital north of 8%. That gets you to, call it, an IRR unlevered in the 7% range, and I think that, that's -- that would meet a hurdle today.","Operator","We'll now take a follow-up from Michael Bilerman.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Brian, just on the leasing in the quarter, just Page 23 of the sub. Can you just peel back the onion a little bit on the 220,000 square feet of new leases? I think you talked about how big box and clearly, just by the term of 16 years. Can you just sort of give a little bit more color on that 33% rent growth? It doesn't seem like PIs were anything big at all to get those leases and sort of what it represented?","Brian M. Smith","Sure. Well, with regard to the rent growth, that was all -- we've got about 5 redevelopments coming up, Michael, and there's 7 anchor tenants that are part of this redevelopments. And it's just taking those from very old -- for example, down in South Florida, we have a Publix anchorage center and a Walgreens, and those are just very, very old leases and we're writing new leases and actually giving them new spaces and just taking them up to market. So there was like a 170,000 square feet of those and the weighted average rent growth was about 180%.","Lisa Palmer","And I would -- and I'll just add color that despite that, rent growth is -- even when you strip those out, rent growth was still positive 3 -- 4% for the quarter, 3% for the year and over 80% of our leases had positive rent growth.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right, and we can see that in the renewals you've been marching up, right? Was there anything particular in the renewals for those to be up 5% or that's continuing the same trend? And your TIs are down also, only at $0.18.","Brian M. Smith","That's right. I mean there's nothing unusual there.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just one quick question, just on bad debt. It's still extraordinarily the provisions for doubtful accounts. It was up over last year, it's still year-to-date lower than where you were. Is there anything in this quarter's number that we should be mindful of, or was it really just 3Q '11 being awfully low.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. It was more of '11 being low. There's nothing unusual. I mean generally speaking, our tenants are much healthier. There aren't any surprises.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take another follow-up from Samit Parikh.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just following up on the question about the recovery rate previously. Back in 2006, 2005, just asking a different way, your NOI margins were still materially higher than they are today. And I understand that as occupancy increases you should see that coming back. Do you think that your margins as you increase closer to 95 plus percent occupancy can go back to where they were 5 years ago? And is that part of your long-term NOI growth model?","Lisa Palmer","We're not seeing any significant changes in terms of actually recovering operating expenses. And to the point about margins, and we've talked about this internally, ground leases actually are in the expenses line items. So it actually negatively impacts your recovery rate and we recently have acquired a couple of properties that are on ground leases and that unfortunately is a permanent change for as long as we own those properties. So maybe we can do a better job of disclosing that to help you get to a more sustainable recovery rate and it's something we'll talk about internally. Because there's no significant change in terms of actual margin on operating expenses. If anything from -- if we were to get back to 95%, I would say we've improved that.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Hap Stein for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin E. Stein","We thank you for participating on the call. Have a great weekend, and we thank you, Bruce.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets for Regency Centers Corporation. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Mas","Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today is Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we start, I would like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll be brief. Our results are excellent in all facets of the business. And I know that Lisa and Brian are looking forward to walking you through the details of the impressive performance of the operating portfolio, development program and the cost-effective execution of our match-funding strategy. We expect this positive momentum to continue into next year.","As you'll hear from Brian, our results to date and my optimism about future NOI growth prospects are indicative of the health of the portfolio, which by all objective measures, is one of the industries' best. We are also benefiting from the favorable supply environment and continuing strong demand for better centers from expanding retailers. I'm especially proud of our disciplined development and redevelopment program that is also performing exceptionally well in spite of increased competition.","I believe that our market teams and their relationships, their local knowledge and experience should allow us to continue to win more than our fair share of the opportunities to develop great shopping centers at compelling profit margins.","Before I turn the call over to Lisa, I want to congratulate Kerr Taylor and the AmREIT board for achieving an exceptional result for their shareholders. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. The positive underlying fundamentals produced strong financial results in the third quarter with core FFO per share of $0.71, representing a 9% per share increase over the third quarter of last year. Same property percent leased increased 50 basis points from the prior quarter to 95.8%, and same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 4.1% for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date.","As in prior quarters, and importantly, base rent growth was the largest contributing factor to overall NOI growth. I would also note that redevelopments had a positive impact of 70 basis points on year-to-date growth.","With these strong results, we are raising the midpoint for core FFO per share by $0.04 to a new range of $2.80 to $2.83. I will quickly run through the drivers of this increase.","First, NOI from the same property pool and developments continues to exceed our expectations. We now expect same property NOI growth in the range of 3.5% to 3.8%, and we expect the same property pool to finish the year in the range of 95.5% to 96% leased. Second, the robust leasing volume that we've experienced has also outpaced projections and is favorably impacting G&A through higher capitalization than originally planned. Lastly, the timing of dispositions in 2014 has continued to become more back-end loaded, and while this benefits earnings for 2014 by approximately only $0.01 per share, it will slightly dampen 2015 FFO growth.","That being said, and as Hap indicated, early projections are showing that same property NOI growth next year should meet and possibly exceed our long-term growth target of 3%. We currently plan to release more detailed 2015 guidance in December through a press release.","In terms of capital markets activity, during the quarter, we raised nearly $50 million using our ATM at a weighted average share price of $57.35. This will fund a portion of this year's and next year's development spend. As a consequence, we lowered the top end of 2014 disposition guidance by $35 million and now intend to sell $15 million less next year than would have otherwise been the case. This is consistent with our match-funding strategy that we've shared with you in the past. We have and will continue to fund our visible development pipeline with property sales, but will also be opportunistic and use equity when it make sense to us.","Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. For some time now, we've been confident that the steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio in terms of quality, location, grocer sales and demographics as well as our efforts to upgrade our merchandising, will begin to take our operational results to an even higher level. Since the beginning of 2012, we've really seen that unfold and continue to gain momentum.","It's worth repeating that the same property portfolio is now 95.8% leased with small shops exceeding 91%, which represents a gain of 200 basis points year-over-year. As occupancy levels heighten, we continue to benefit from limited new supply, giving us even more purchasing power and allowing us to achieve double-digit rent growth in every quarter of this year.","In addition, contractual rent steps have been a significant area of focus, and we're making great strides, receiving better midterm increases from both national and small shop tenants. In fact, rent steps for all leases signed year-to-date have averaged nearly 2%. This represents a meaningful increase over the current portfolio average of 1.3%.","Total and small-shop moveouts have also trended very positively over the last 5 quarters and continue to be well below historic norms despite our proactive efforts to terminate leases where we have the opportunity. For these reasons, as Hap and Lisa both indicated, the outlook for 2015 operating fundamentals is looking really good.","Turning to development. Competition is increasing, but today, we fared well in this competitive landscape due in large part to our experience, local presence, credibility and strong retailer relationships. We've also been successful in leveraging our relationships with residential and office developers to become a retail developer of choice in many master-planned communities. This was the case with our 2 third quarter starts, which I'd like to further describe.","The first, CityLine Market, will be an 80,000 square-foot shopping center anchored by Whole Foods. CityLine Market will be part of a 186-acre mixed-use project in suburban Dallas. The initial phase of the project is currently underway, with 2 million square feet of office space that will be occupied by nearly 10,000 State Farm and Raytheon employees, along with 1,000 multifamily units in an Aloft Hotel, all having walkable access to our center. Construction on this phase of the project will be complete prior to CityLine's opening in early 2016. And that's just the beginning. Subsequent phases will triple the build-out I just mentioned.","Because of the premier location and consistent with our fresh-look branding, we're focused on ways to increase connectivity between retailers and customers, enhance the walkability of the community and incorporate large open spaces into the design to encourage customers to come, shop and stay. To date, we've had overwhelming interest in this project, with quality prospects for more than 95% of the space. Some exciting restaurant concepts and premier health and wellness-focused service providers round out the current lineup.","Our second development start, Belmont Shopping Center, is equally impressive. Belmont will benefit from a very affluent trade area, boasting the highest median income in the country. It is well located at the entrance of Toll Brothers' master-planned community of Belmont at the interchange of a major east-west thoroughfare linking the community to Tysons Corner and downtown Washington D.C. The Belmont residential component is fully built out and consists of nearly 2,200 homes and townhomes, with the highest price point of any community in the Toll Brothers portfolio. It also includes the Belmont Executive Center, which is approved for 1.4 million square feet of other uses. Belmont Center will also be anchored by Whole Foods and already has an outstanding lineup of restaurant operators, including West Coast-borne MOD Pizza and The Habit Burger Grill, each choosing Belmont as their first location in the region. Despite having just started construction, this center is quickly approaching 85% leased, and along with CityLine Market, is a stacking up to be an exceptional addition to the portfolio.","Turning to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 5 assets for a net pro rata proceeds of nearly $60 million. Interest has been strong and our assets marketed for sale. We're seeing improved pricing and often receiving multiple offers. This, combined with the fact that we're taking better properties to market given the overall quality of the portfolio, is allowing us to match fund acquisitions with dispositions at comparable cap rates. As a result, I'm confident in our ability to continue to cost-effectively fund developments and acquisitions with property sales.","Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Think you, Brian, and thank you, Lisa. To close, I'm extremely gratified by the positive results that Regency's dedicated and talented team continues to produce. In addition, I'm excited about Regency's future prospects to sustain growth in net asset value and earnings per share through our formula of NOI growth from a high-quality portfolio, value-creating development and redevelopments and a strong balance sheet. We look forward to seeing many of you in Atlanta for NAREIT's annual REITWorld conference.","We thank you for your time, and we'll now turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Carlington with Green Street Advisors.","Jay Carlington","Brian, you hinted that that 2% contractual rent number for leases signed. It was -- I guess, that's kind of above your 1.5% long-term goal. Is that kind of a good run rate to think about? And what does that imply to your longer-term NOI growth?","Brian M. Smith","Well, our goal is to get this up to 1.5% for the whole portfolio from the 1.3%. I think the run rate for the leases that are signed each quarter in the 1.8% to 2% range is about right. But given that that's still is a small percentage of the whole portfolio, it's just going to take a while to lift the entire portfolio.","Jay Carlington","Okay. So does it feel like that's something that's sustainable through '15, that kind of 2% type number with new leases signed?","Brian M. Smith","Yes. I think, it's like 2% for the quarter and 1.8% year-to-date. But if anything, we're getting more momentum in that regard, so I think it is a good run rate.","Martin E. Stein","But [ph] over it. Okay, and [indiscernible] period, the number could exceed 1.5% to 2 -- go, of course to 2%. In effect, we're turning about 10% of the space a year, so think about it that way. So to get it to 1.5% will take us a few years to get that, but I think the run rate beyond that is pretty encouraging.","Jay Carlington","Okay. And Lisa, I think you've said in the past, you consider equity issuances as a financing alternative when the stock was trading favorably in relation to your NAV. So curious how you view the recent share issuance of the ATM this quarter.","Lisa Palmer","I would again just reiterate that the use of equity is consistent with our articulated match-funding strategy to fund our development. We, first, look to property sale, low growth assets, but as you said, Jay, to the extent that equity is trading within -- each quarter, what we do is we establish -- or not even each quarter, it's really daily, we think about equity and we establish a relatively narrow-range view of NAV based on current private market pricing. And when we believe that equity is trading within that range, we will cap the ATM program.","Martin E. Stein","But not all the time, as -- but as a component of our match-funding strategy.","Lisa Palmer","And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the extent that we do raise equity, it will be replacing property sales. It's not in addition to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And this is Christy here for Michael. Brian and Lisa, you both touched on this in your remarks. But I'm just wondering, as the external NOI growth expectations have continued to be revised higher throughout the year, what would you say has been the biggest positive surprise to internal growth in 2014? Your -- some of your comments would suggest occupancy, but you also talk a lot about the contractual rent, so just looking for more color on that. And the occupancy, would you say that incremental leasing or fewer moveouts was the greatest factor?","Brian M. Smith","It's all that. The -- it was driven by base rent. And so it's all the components of the base rent. We had strong leasing. I think overall, it's about 10% for the pro rata basis, higher than it was the same quarter last year. Our rent steps are higher, our rent growth continues to trend up and we've also had very, very favorable moveout.","I think I mentioned last quarter that's it's rare that the moveouts get to 300,000 square feet per quarter, and that 3 of the 4 quarters, we're at or below 300,000. This quarter, it was 224,000. So it just shows you the continued positive surprise on the moveouts, but also strongly seeing rent steps and rent growth.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then I'm not sure if you're able to comment on this, regarding the bidding process for AmREIT and sort of how you thought about value, the assets and the context of what your maximum bids be, and maybe what you think about the ultimate deal price as about the frothiness in the market.","Martin E. Stein","Well, we have work as -- I'm not going to comment on the process. I will comment from the standpoint as we think that -- as I said, I think the company achieved great pricing and a great result for their shareholders. And being a shareholder, we're very happy with the outcome. I'll also note that as you, Christy, know, and others on the call may know, we've already got a wonderful platform in Houston that we feel really good about and we're happy to have that.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you say what your total costs were associated with the pursuit of AmREIT?","Martin E. Stein","No.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.","Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question, Brian or Hap. On the escalators, I guess, really just in terms of your leasing approach right now, how do you balance out your opportunities to push escalators versus control of the space versus the TI dollars. How are you thinking about your leasing approach to tenants at this point?","Brian M. Smith","Well, the #1 thing we're looking at is the quality of the user. So first and foremost, that's what we want. Market rents continue to go up and we expect to get at least market rents. And then from that point on, it's the escalator. So it's really all of the above to the extent you got an incredible retailer that provides some kind of a wow factor with a center, we think would enhance the leasability of that center and the overall -- I think, the overall NOI growth, then we may work with them on the steps versus the initial rent. But what we found so far is that's not the case. On the -- if you look at kind of the Fresh Look tenants we've been putting in, we've not only been getting the high initial rent, but we've been getting consistent steps and the build-outs have been very modest. So we look at the mall. It's a lease-by-lease situation but right now, they all seem to be going in our favor.","Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then just on the shadow development pipeline of things that you're looking at, is that getting incrementally larger? Or how are you thinking about that over the long haul, over the next sort of 3 years? Is that -- what's the outlook for that pipeline?","Brian M. Smith","Well, first and foremost, we are very focused on the developments because we think developing these quality centers in strong protected market is an important driver of NAV and it's a differentiating competitive advantage for us. We have the desire and the capability to do more but it's pretty tough out there. So for 2014, we expect we'll be at the high end of the guidance range, about $240 million. After that, we're looking at $150 million to $200 million and that could be lumpy, just -- that's the nature of development. And as much as we'd love to do more, we are limited by the opportunity set, given the discipline that we're showing in terms of what kind of properties, what kind of markets we want to pursue. And then, as you are aware, we're also restricted by the limit that we put on it of no more than 2x EBITDA for total commitments.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Martin E. Stein","For those of you all that took time away from NAREIT, it's greatly appreciated and we'll let you go back to whatever you do related to NAREIT. Thank you very much for your time on the call. And everybody, have a great day, and look forward to seeing a lot of you, as I indicated earlier, in Atlanta. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

The results of their exemplary efforts had led to average growth in core FFO over the last three years of almost 8%, and total shareholder return over that same period at the top of our peer group.","Before I turn the call over to Mac and Lisa, let me remind you why we are so excited about our pending merger with Equity One. The transaction combines two high-quality, highly complementary platforms and firmly establishes our position as the premier national shopping center company, with several unique advantages. We will own an unparallel portfolios with an excellent mix of first-class neighborhood and community centers for the growth we anchored focus.","As important, this merger deepens our concentrations in affluent and in-field trade areas with strong demographics to attract leading retailers, combined these factors will produce better merchandizing and higher rental and occupancy rates, driving stronger organic growth. Also the two portfolios have significant overlaps in many of the countries, but as attractive metro areas, providing us with enhanced brand presence and economies of scale contributing to the transaction substantial synergies.","In addition, considerable value from the unmatched pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities will be unlocked by our experienced team. The merger preserves our balance sheet strength and flexibility, maintaining our access to multiple sources of capital, at the lowest cost. Results of these compelling attributes will be a diversified cash flow stream with better NOI, better earnings and better NAV growth potential. I cannot overstate our excitement and enthusiasm, and we look forward to closing the merger and creating substantial value for many years to come.","I\u2019ll now like to turn the call over to Mac Chandler.","Mac Chandler","Thanks Hap and good morning. 2016 was an impressive year for development and redevelopment. During the year, we started 16 new projects representing a total investment of more than $200 million and a weighted 7.6% return. Despite significant competition for the best projects, we continue to source and execute on compelling opportunities in target markets that enhance our high-quality portfolio.","I\u2019ll quickly highlight a couple of our recent developments. In December, we started Chimney Rock Crossing, a 218,000 square feet center located with an affluent New York suburb, anchored by Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack, and Saks Off 5th. This location will create a true regional drop, creating a dominate center for both best-in-class anchors and shopping center. We took ownership of the property with complex entitlements in place and anchored leases substantially negotiated, which created mitigated risks.","The Village at Riverstone located within Houston\u2019s fastest growing master-planned community also started in December. It would be a dominated Kroger-anchored center, aligned with meeting national and regional restaurants and restaurant providers, already more than 80% in Houston community before even start construction. This project will be an outstanding addition to our premier to Houston presence. These terrific new additions totaled more than $100 million of net new investments.","At year end 2016, our in process developments and redevelopments represented a total investment nearly $300 million, yielding a blended return nearly 8%. Our ability to continue to execute on these great projects is a testament to our industry-leading national development platform, which is driven by a joint relationship, local market expertise and attractive cost of capital. This is why we are able to consistently source and deliver of the most compelling investment opportunities.","As we look forward to 2017, I am enthusiastic about our pipeline. To that end, we have great visibility a couple of first half 2017 starts. The first [Indiscernible] anchored center in the DC market and the second a Whole Foods opportunity located outside of Chicago. In addition, we have other promising opportunities that are progressing nicely in target markets like Seattle, Miami and Raleigh. Likewise, I am particularly excited about the prospects of sharing with you our vision of Equity One's redevelopment pipeline in the months become.","I would now like to turn call over to Lisa.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. Our high-quality portfolio continues to perform extremely well. At year end, our same property percent lease is more than 96%, including 93% of shop basis. This is especially impressive given the team's accomplishment in the face of a handful of retailer bankruptcies. The benefit of such a strong portfolio running a historically high occupancy continues to translate in the better merchandizing and pricing color.","Leasing spread for the quarter where the mid-teens including rent growth of more than 12% for new deals. This strength and core fundamentals led the same property NOI growth for the year of 3.5%, including nearly 4% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by growth in base rents. But as a reminder for 2017, we do anticipate moderating same property NOI growth impacted by last year's bankruptcy-related store closings. While we've largely backfilled these anchor boxes, the new tenants will be up and running until the second half of this year.","Turning to the capital markets, maintaining a fortress balance sheet continues to be the foundational principle for Regency; and as we entered 2017, we have the strongest balance sheet in the Company's history. Subsequent to year-end, we issued our first ever third-year bonds with proceeds of $300 million at a 4.4% coupon. These currencies will be used to fund the full redemptions of our 6 and 5 days percent preferred stock. This issuance and the redemption significantly improved free cash flows and fixed charge coverage.","At the same time, we also issued $350 million of 10-year bonds at a 3.6% coupon. These proceeds will be used for certain transaction cost related to the pending merger, including the refinancing of some of the in place Equity One's short-term debt. Importantly, in the unlikely event, if the merger does not close, these bonds include a mandatory redemption option. As a result of the third-year bond offering and the savings from the redemption of the preferred stock, we increased core FFO guidance by $0.02.","At the same time, you will also note that we reduced nearly FFO guidance by $0.07 which is incorporating the one-time cost related to the preferred redemptions. More importantly, please note that we've not included any impact of the 10-year offering on the updated ranges and any merger-related impacts are currently excluded from all guidance metrics. We intend to update guidance to reflect the impact of the merger in the coming months.","For acquisitions guidance, you'll note that it has not changed from previous disclosure, but I didn\u2019t want to clarify that we do have a shopping center under contract in the Northeast, which we hope to close in the coming months. And as a reminder the majority of the remaining $90 million in the proceeds from our March 2016 forward equity offerings will be used to fund this acquisition.","The echo of those have been met, 2016 was a great year on many fronts and we look forward to a tremendous 2017, as we are extremely excited about the prospects of not only closing the merger, but especially integrating and operating the combined company.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now open to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","I wondered if you could comment on retailers appetite to participate in redevelopments, is that interest growing whole in steady or somewhat decreasing?","Mac Chandler","Thanks Craig. This is Mac. I'd be happy to answer that. I think it's steady to just growing, I mean retailers are constantly looking for shopping centers that are relevant, that are contemporary and we have a robust pipeline of active redevelopments, and one step we're working on some in the near future, but some also many years away. So, it's a healthy trend and we feel it's continuing to want to play a part in an active redevelopment.","Craig Schmidt","And then just on transactions. Are you noticing that transaction pace is slowing nationally? Or what should read on transactions for 2017?","Mac Chandler","You're talking about capital market transactions or you are telling about our leasing transactions?","Craig Schmidt","I am sorry, buying and selling of shopping centers. Maybe not that\u2019s so much your outlook, but a national of its staying is active to '16 or slowing?","Lisa Palmer","We haven't seen any material change. And if you think about the arena that we play in, it's a much smaller set on the buying side than national. So, we may not even necessarily see everything that\u2019s coming nationally because I think it's pretty clear to our broker relationships to sell a relationship of the higher quality set we are targeting to buy. But at this point in time, there is still a lot of capital pursuing, the higher quality premier shopping centers, and we continue to see demand for the lower growth, slightly higher cap rate properties, but we intend to sell.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Lisa, I am thinking about the components of your same-property NOI growth in '17, realizing the slower growth rate is mostly bankruptcy related from 2016 closures. What are you assuming for releasing spreads? And has anything changed in terms of pricing power and lease negotiation given the tougher retail environment?","Hap Stein","I\u2019ll start that and Mac or Jim, if anybody wants to add any color after. For same property NOI growth, we do have the headwinds of the bankruptcies we saw that a little bit in obviously latter half of 2016 as well. We also have -- we are also going to be in 2017 comping off relatively higher other income line item, I think you've probably saw that in our actual results of rather large easy payment, actually at one of our future redevelopments that Mac just kind of alluded to.","But with regards to rents spreads, it's still really healthy robust demand, and we would expect that leasing spread will be very similar to what we have achieved in the past few years, which is double digit. I think that overtime, you may see us maybe stabilizing the high single digits, but we are still assuming that we are going to have very healthy double digit rent growth.","Mac Chandler","The only thing I would add is, I think at 96% lease we still have -- we're enjoying pretty strong landlord leverage. And with the qualities of portfolio, we feel good to see the spreads are going to maintain around the levels we have been doing.","Christy McElroy","Great, thanks. And then just a higher level, in your comments recent with groceries especially some of these specialty groceries, how often is the topic of on line new tick providers and sort of growth over that business come up in discussion of its future competitive thread, in a contents of sort of the overall thread from e-commerce to grocery?","Mac Chandler","Christy, it's Mac, I\u2019ll be happy to answer that. We heard in conversations, the grocers actually especially groceries are well aware of it, but it's hasn\u2019t dampened their expansion efforts whether desire to open new stores. So, some are trying to do it themselves. Some are outsourcing as we all know. But it hasn\u2019t affected their core business, it's a sort of a unique component of that business, but it's not the first topic of conversation, but eventually it comes up, but it's not prominent in the size.","Jim Thompson","Ironically, they're focused from a new-store standpoint as investment filled in urban areas, which is why there is more off and online competition. So, like Mac said, they're not all mindful of it as we are not, but at the same time -- and they are being highly selective, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it's we still got healthy demand for space.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremy Metz from UBS. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","I know you specifically can't talk about the Equity One deal here, but one of the attractive aspects is obviously the robust development pipeline, they had a lot of that was mixed used intensifying sites. So, maybe a question for Mac, but I was hoping if you could just more broadly talk about taking on bigger mixed used projects in today's environments, given the increasing pressure on retailers possibly for slowing demand for space and couple of this one is increasing sale and supply we're hearing about?","Mac Chandler","Well, I'll try to answer this in a broad sense I suppose to specifically to Equity One. The best way to perform on big larger scale mixed used projects is [Indiscernible] because you can be thoughtful and patient, and you can wait for the best possible outcomes in terms of entitlement and [Indiscernible] and design. So, those are easier to execute on, and we prefer those a lot.","You are still seeing larger scale mixed used projects come out as well, that's apparent, but the trend you see in every major city. But most of those projects were conceived years ago, but there are still many people have equal number of projects that are on the boards and will see if they come out of ground. But the appetite doesn't appear to be accelerating or decelerating, if so pretty stay there, there is a clear demand from tenants and consumers to be in this box.","Hap Stein","And we will be starting knock on wood, a mixed used development within next quarter. But just once again, Jeremy, our focus -- and we had substantially enhanced with Mac and his team and the teams did well. Our capabilities from mixed used standpoint and our focus is on being better to mixed used to get to the retail portions of those mixed used opportunities where they are within our owned portfolio or new development opportunities.","Mac Chandler","Meaning to continue to partner with best-in-class developers and operators for the other sectors that would be part of the mixed used --","Hap Stein","Like we get in clear with and we have a long day","Jim Thompson","And like from this opportunity that we expect to start in the next quarter.","Jeremy Metz","Got it. Appreciated. And then just Lisa one for you, you had mentioned having a shopping center in a contract and using the outstanding forward to fund that. So, in terms of the zero to 90 million of dispositions, should we think about that only happening, if you identified additional acquisitions from here and therefore and maybe more of a source of funding? Do you find additional deals?","Lisa Palmer","The dispositions will fund our developments, and we do have developments in process that have spent that will happen this year. So, it's not even necessarily related to the new start although we have great visibility as Mac said in his prepared remarks on the call to several of those as well. If you think about free cash flows, which is almost a $100 million in 2016 and then disposed funding our developments.","Jeremy Metz","And anything on the contract today?","Lisa Palmer","The one that we have in -- you mean the acquisition that we have in contract in the Northeast, we will use the equity to fund that.","Jeremy Metz","Sorry, on the disposition front, you had any under contract?","Lisa Palmer","We do not.","Hap Stein","We had late close in December and that was one of the close-in into the first quarter of this year, but it was --","Lisa Palmer","Correct, the larger, the team across that you saw on our discloser, close to $50 million.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Could you just give a quick update on some of your development projects? I noticed that a couple of your projects expect the yield went down, any commentary on there?","Mac Chandler","Ki, this is Mac, I\u2019ll answer that. We feel really good about our in process pipeline. It's performing well. There, we really have no specific terms to talk about. We did take a case in our Northeast project where we converted a pad, which we're going to ground lease and we converted it to building, a building that cause their cost to go up, but that\u2019s pretty standard figure. But our returns are solid and we are hitting our underwriting lease. We feel good about that.","Lisa Palmer","I think its new development that we brought online that was a lower -- that's not so much shift in what was already in process.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, I might be looking at the wrong column. So, never mind about that. Yes, and I am not sure how much you want to talk about the merger? But just broadly speaking, I was wondering if -- since announcement, if there is any kind of new things that you've learned whether it'd be synergies or the way you want to run the corporate structure overall, any kind of commentary on there?","Lisa Palmer","We love to talk about it, because we are really excited about it. But unfortunately the good point, we are really limited in what we can say. And since announcement, we work through separately operating companies and we have been operating in that way and are required to operate in that way. So, we can't wait to talk about it and we will do that at the appropriate time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Please go ahead.","Floris van Dijkum","Question for Hap or Lisa. You guys -- you are about embark on this merger, you got fortress balance sheet, 4.4 times net to EBITDA and be of most of the sector. You have got all the markets to that everybody wants and the coastal markets, and you've increased that with the -- if you add the Equity Once. The question I have is, so what are your biggest worries? Or what are the biggest concerns? Or what you think are the biggest risks to the business?","Hap Stein","Let me just say, I think we've got it indicated before. While we are not on mindful of the economic challenges that are out there of the disruptors that are out there, but there is still a strong conviction on our part that well-anchored, well-located community and neighborhood shopping centers particularly those that grocery anchored are going to continue -- is going to be strong demand from the better retailers for those shopping centers. So that's number one.","Number two, we believe that our development program is a great way to feel great shopping centers and redeveloped great shopping centers at attractive returns on capital that are adding to NAV. And I think you can have a high-quality portfolio and a right side and top core development program, and a fortress balance sheet that's the best way to navigate and an experienced management team to the challenges that are going to be out there. And I think, we are going to be very well positioned to the extent there is a downturn or a storm out there to weather that storm and even profit from those opportunities.","Floris van Dijkum","And does that mean that you feel pretty good where you are, but you are nimble enough to be able to withstand any sort of unforeseen events. Is that how we should read that answer?","Hap Stein","Well, to think that any entity in the world is going to be totally immune to changes and technology to changes in economic conditions, I think that is that's not going to be the case. But at the same time, I think we are extremely well positioned to not only survive what may happen economically and what may happen from a in a very changing world. I think it's a thriving true formula and I think also to not only survive, but to thrive. And it doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to sit fast. Because as we said to ourselves, we are a -- we think we are good, but we think that there is an opportunity to continue to improve in every aspect of our business, on a journey of building a great company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Gorman from BTIG. Please go ahead.","Michael Gorman","Just had a question on disposition, if you look back over call at the last five years or so, you sold or counting the 2017 guidance -- you've sold about a 1.2 billion in assets kind of ranging from 6.5 caps up to kind of sub-8. I'm just wondering as you look at portfolio today kind of what if anything is less than that potential disposition bucket, as we go through 2017 and start looking out into 2018 and beyond?","Lisa Palmer","We significantly reduce the number of properties and the percent of the value of our company that would fit in kind of the 6.5% to 8% cap rate and I mean significantly by virtue of selling and close to a $1 billion in property. So, we have very little out there. Shopping centers and neighborhoods half even just kind of alluded to a little there constantly evolving and changing, and there are always going to be centers that are going to be towards the lower quality and lower or above end of the spectrum in our portfolio.","I don\u2019t think it towards incident, if you will, but it's a really small percentage of what we owned. And when you think about our strategic funding model, we will use dispositions to continue to fund our development spend. And we will when appropriate access the capital market that\u2019s we did in 2016. So, the best way to answer is this is very small part and what we would consider the low end of our spectrum is a pretty high bar, because I think we have one of the best portfolios in the business.","Michael Gorman","Great. So, Lisa, if I take your comments, is it's sort of fair to say that kind of going forward it's more -- it's less about, it will be less about getting rate of sort of a lower quality, but in a more just about preening and trading out what you consider to be the bottom end versus what's a better comp and development. So if there is future funding to developments at a disposition, the cap rates could be even lower than we are seeing right now?","Lisa Palmer","That\u2019s going to be property specific, but even looking at the properties that we sold last year. We sold them that had a five in front of this. So, yes, I mean that\u2019s the case because it's not only just necessarily lower quality, but its lower growth, because part of the model is top recycle the lower growth then it maybe because of the lower quality, but it could do business there. There is not allowed inherent growth in that asset, so recycling capital from lower growth into higher quality, higher growth property.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Just a big general question and it relates to sort of the amount of time it gets between a lease is signed to win rent commences. Has there been any shift either quick, more quickly or longer in that process say over the last year or so?","Jim Thompson","Chris, this is Jim. We really haven't seen any noticeable difference quite frankly. It does take time, it's probably close -- it's probably tough around the front end to have tenants really there very focus, they are very picky, once you execute to delivery, we are not saying expanded period of time.","Chris Lucas","Okay and then maybe expand a little bit on the Chimney Rock development, the yield is definitely lower than what we are using to see from you guys from a roundup perspective. What was the underwriting approach? And what is unique about this been has sort of value add beyond that sort of expected going in 6.5 yield?","Mac Chandler","Chris, really it's a risk adjusted return, that\u2019s what the big picture we have looking at it. The family that has owned the site for decade or so, spent a long time getting a very complex rate entitlements, including some very expensive off sites, which were not only entitled, but actually delivered in site. So, they also brought along with the opportunity really all four incur leases, which were substantially negotiated in final lease form and one of them was actually signed.","So from a risk adjusted basis, we were comfortable stepping into that project. The site was also 30% graded and had some very complex grading that went along with that and risky. And because they had taken on the first started it, they had mitigated the risk out of the project and determined how much [Indiscernible] was there, which they moved and remediated. So, we stepped into with it, it was not completely a layout, but very much different than the typical development.","We feel that return was appropriate, still a good 150 to probably 200 basis points spread between that where we could sell it today, got good growth. They did a good job, negotiating the four anchored leases. So, they have good growth and good visibility towards the shopping leasing, and we're getting really good quality tenants with good growth, and we love the location well too. This is a high, high very density location, very affluent and just to be for the one of a kind center. It's the closest of those within 30-minute drive time, and we feel really good about it. It's failing to attract a lot of very affluent customers that triggers.","Jim Thompson","I would say to that I agree what Mac said, it's 200 basis points instead of saying or where we could sell today or where we could buy it today. So, this is fairly long and very long time, for a very long time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Dorman","Hey, it's Michael Dorman from Citi. Lisa you mentioned just you're operating two separate companies today and you still wanted to stay close in the merger to share more information. Can you just sort of let us know what the plan is in terms of timing of sharing that information? I know, you are planning a larger conference call post merger or you just kind of wait for 1Q results? Just for that we should know at what point you are going to come out with a more full from document and opportunity for us those questions?","Lisa Palmer","The Shareholder Meeting is on February 24th and then I'm certain that you read every page of the merger agreement, so you will then know that the schedule close would be March 1st based on the number of days post the Shareholder Meeting. And then, at this time our plan is to wait until our first quarter earnings call and certainly if that changes you guys will know, but there is a lot of complexities around the non-cash mark-to-market and we just want to be sure that we have all of that fully done so that we can give 100% disclosure rather than seeing it up to you guys and pieces.","We are very competitive to being very transparent and we will do our best so I'll give the best disclosure at they all return. But will reiterate what we told all of you when we made the announcement in November and in subsequent Investor Meeting. We still expect it to be accretive to core FFO even before of that incremental non-cash mark-to-market and we expect it to be even more accretive to same property NOI growth than it is to core FFO.","Michael Dorman","Well, I don\u2019t think the non-cash comes on cash and there is really no impact on our valuation really and I'm curious too much about that I think they care more you can see from the questions on the call about the integration the development the redevelopment operating structural personnel things like that. I'm just curious as you will you sort of host a more in-depth Analyst Day to go through the go forward as we see entities come together?","Mike Mas","Sure. Hi, Michael, this is Mike. A more fulsome Analyst Day and Investor Day is certainly in our minds, we haven\u2019t hosted one in quite a long-time, and this would actually be the time to reach to reengage on that front. We are working on plans those plans would likely to be included event towards the end of the year and we are looking forward to that very much and introducing our thoughts around many of these projects that will be inheriting as well as go forward plans for the combined company.","Michael Dorman","And then just lastly just in terms of transition as we think about it. How much of the senior seats we exactly going to see from Equity One would come over? And that deal closes March 1st, should we expect any transition from the B team or is it more lower level, market level people that you are assuming of it initially?","Hap Stein","There would be done -- that can be pretty clear that there will be no sea sweep [ph] coming over to the combined company. And then the addition would basically be operation exposure field level and back half of this which lead to be new employee hires or Equity One plus.","Unidentified Analyst","Even on a transitionary period, so there is no one even coming over full period of time at all?","Hap Stein","We look at -- we'll address that.","Michael Mas","Not from the C.","Hap Stein","Not from C sweep [ph].","Michael Dorman","Okay.","Hap Stein","From transition a standpoint, we would obviously address which necessary to operate the properties to do the appropriate amount of accounting and the transition from, on from redevelopments.","Michael Dorman","Okay thank you.","Hap Stein","There wide work to be done but we feel very, very comfortable what I find as more to come on specifics.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate your time and we wish you to rest -- a good rest of the week and a great weekend. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"18134":["Regency Centers Corporation (NASDAQ:REG) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call August  4, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Laura Clark - Investor Relations","Hap Stein - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Lisa Palmer - President and Chief Financial Officer","Mac Chandler - Executive Vice President, Investments","Jim Thompson - Executive Vice President, Operations","Analysts","Katy Mcconnell - Citigroup","Nick Yulico - UBS","George Hoglund - Jefferies","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Samir Khanal - Evercore ISI","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laura Clark. Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Clark","Good morning and welcome to Regency\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today on the call are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; and Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations.","I would like to start by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","On today\u2019s call, we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Yesterday afternoon, we reported another quarter of solid operating results, our high quality portfolio shopping centers located in affluent and dense infill trade areas continues to perform well. Leasing levels are nearly 96% with small shop leasing surpassing 92%. These healthy fundamentals produce year-to-date same property NOI growth of 3.5% and fortify future sustainable growth. When combined with our development and redevelopment expertise, fortress balance sheet, and exceptional team, all of which were only made stronger with the integration of Equity One. We are well-positioned to achieve our strategic objectives and create value for our shareholders. At the same time, we remain very mindful that the retail landscape continues to change, including the ongoing evolution of the grocery industry.","Amazon\u2019s announced purchase of Whole Foods reinforces our conviction that a well-located bricks and mortar presence that is convenient to the customer is a critical component to the success of any omni-channel platform. The best grocers, which anchor the vast majority of our centers, are more focused than ever on advancing their own technology, pricing and shopping experiences to service their customers and grow revenues and profits. They benefit from extensive and irreplaceable platforms in our target markets with average sales of over $650 per square foot and healthy occupancy cost below 2%.","We will certainly not be immune to the changes occurring in the retail business and are keenly focused on the disruptors facing us today and those that we might face in the future. We have a proven track record of successfully navigating and even profiting from industry challenges and we will continue to adapt and make decisions that will enable our retail centers to not only survive, but prosper over the long-term. We are prepared to own, operate and invest in a world where the bifurcation between the winning and losing grocers and retailers will accelerate as will the growing separation between the better shopping centers and everything else. That said, Regency\u2019s unequaled national portfolio, where the best-in-class retailers will want to locate the physical stores, disciplined capital allocation strategy and experienced elite team position us extremely well for the future.","I will now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Thompson","Thank you, Hap and good morning. The quality of our portfolio and our team is truly evident in our second quarter results. Portfolio occupancy remains at historically high levels that we experienced a slight dip in overall occupancy driven by one anticipated anchor move-out. Our same property portfolio remains at nearly 96% leased. What I am especially pleased about is our shop occupancy, which jumped back above 92% and represents an impressive 30 basis point increase sequentially.","We continued to experience steady demand for space from a wide variety of tenants across many categories, which include value retailers, fast casual restaurants, fitness operators, pet stores and service users among others. While retailers are being more deliberate and selective with their expansion plans, they continue to seek out the better locations, many of which are at our well merchandised centers. Leasing spreads on new deals in the quarter were 14% highlighted by strong anchor spreads of 26% and shop rent spreads over 12%.","Regarding bankruptcies, our exposure to store closures remains minimal. Announced 2017 store closures represent only 20 stores in our portfolio of over 9,000 tenants. We have successfully re-leased or in lease negotiations for 95% of the anchor spaces we have received back over the past 18 months. Our second quarter results very limited exposure to bankruptcies and store rationalizations as well as our success in re-leasing locations that do close collectively demonstrate the differentiation of the Regency platform and leaves us confident in our ability to produce sector leading NOI growth and operating fundamentals.","I will now turn the call over to Mac.","Mac Chandler","Thanks, Jim. Our development and redevelopment activity remains robust as we sourced compelling opportunities within our target markets and portfolio. Our in-process projects now exceed $600 million of developments and redevelopments with the expected returns of nearly 7.5% creating significant value that will drive future growth. During the second quarter, we started Mellody Farm, a $100 million ground-up development located within a highly affluent suburb of Chicago. The 250,000 square foot center is anchored by strong lineup featuring Whole Foods, REI, Nordstrom Rack and HomeGoods. Pre-leasing the best-in-class restaurants and service providers is off to an impressive start.","Our development team is making significant progress on several exciting redevelopment projects within the portfolio. At Costa Verde in La Jolla, California, we are progressing with our approvals to densify the shopping center to take advantage of the vibrant growth in University Town Center. At Market Common Clarendon, located in Metro Washington DC, we are working well with the community towards repositioning the existing office building to attract the new retail and creative office tenants that will enhance the overall center. We also continue to make progress within our now integrated Equity One portfolio, including Westwood Shopping Center located in Bethesda, the Collection at Harvard Square in Cambridge and Potrero Center in San Francisco, just to name a few. I look forward to sharing further details on these as well as other exciting opportunities on the future calls.","Turning to disposition activity, demand for the properties we are selling remained steady across all markets. As a reminder, we would use disposition proceeds to fund our new investment activities. As our development and redevelopment spending ramps up through the remainder of 2017, our disposition should as well. We are maintaining our previous guidance of $100 million to $200 million of dispositions. In regards to acquisitions, we remain under contract with the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past. This is an acquisition of an exceptional ground-up development that we will close upon construction completion and anchor rent commitment. This opportunity may close late this year, but appears more likely to close early next year. Lastly, we are currently evaluating several compelling acquisition opportunities located entirely to target markets. In any of these opportunities, we could further enhance our portfolio quality and NOI growth profile.","I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Matt and good morning all. In addition to solid operating results from our high-quality portfolio and an impressive roster of in-process developments, we made enhancements to our already sector leading balance sheet by extending our maturity duration and lowering our overall effective interest rate. During the quarter, we completed a successful reopening of our 10-year and 30-year unsecured notes that we originally issued in January. We opportunistically raised $300 million across the two tranches to retire high coupon mortgage debt, preferred stock and pay-down our line of credit balance.","While this offering was completed in the weeks following the news of the Amazon Whole Foods merger, which as most of you know led to significant volatility in the equity markets. It is important to note that we experienced minimal impact to demand or pricing. We were extremely gratified by the support shown from the fixed income investment community for Regency\u2019s platform and our high quality and well located portfolio. A quick note on the merger\/integration, the team has made exceptional progress highlighted by our operating results including a meaningful increase in shop space percent leased during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving the $27 million in merger related synergies that we have originally projected.","Turning to guidance, as a result of retiring secured mortgages, we incurred one-time costs of approximately $12 million in the second quarter. We will also expense the non-cash preferred issuance charges of approximately $2.5 million in the third quarter. This is related to the redemption of those deferred securities. These one-time items will reduce net income and NAREIT FFO per share by approximately $0.09 for the full year as reflected in our revised guidance. And additionally we have revised our net interest expense guidance to reflect these transactions. As Mac discussed, our disposition timing is tied to our investment spending needs and the majority of our dispositions are now expected to occur in the second half of the year. Due to this later than originally projected timing and therefore greater than expected contribution to NOI from these target dispositions, we have increased the bottom end of our core FFO guidance range.","And also related to investment spending we have extended the maturity of our outstanding forward equity issuance to the end of the year as this better aligns the timing of the forward equity with our future funding needs. And finally given the solid results in the quarter and year-to-date, we are reaffirming our 2017 same-property NOI guidance as we expect this positive momentum to continue for the remainder of the year.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Katy Mcconnell","Good morning. This is Katy Mcconnell on for Christy. Could you provide some more color on the new development projects out of this quarter as far as pre-leasing demand and yield expectations relative to the rest of the pipeline and then just given halfway through this anchor, can you talk about any changes you expect in terms of the store build out following the merger?","Mac Chandler","Sure Katy, this is Mac. I would be happy to take that. We are very pleased with the progress of that project. We have been working this project for a number of years. The return looks very solid at a 6.9% return. And that\u2019s in part because of the team we have had on place. We were able to obtain a $20 million and attract four very good quality solid tenants. Whole Foods is our anchor of submission, REI, HomeGoods and Nordstrom Rack are supporting it. Whole Foods is doing everything we have asked them to do. They are \u2013 they will be prepared to commence with their store once we deliver it. We are still upgrading at this point. But the shop leasing is going well. We have had a lot of demand. We are negotiating over 25,000 square foot \u2013 square feet in leases right now. So we like the progress, it\u2019s still very early. But all signs point to a successful project. And I think that\u2019s commensurate with the quality and the type of tenancy that we are looking for in other developments.","Katy Mcconnell","Okay, great.","Hap Stein","And regarding the impact on Whole Foods from the purchase by Amazon, we feel that it should be very positive for Whole Foods. We expect it would remove any uncertainty about new store openings. It appears like it\u2019s going to allow Whole Foods to reduce their cost and be more price competitive. And obviously, Amazon\u2019s direct and indirect industry presence will continue to grow. They are paying over $40 million a store, so we don\u2019t expect them to do anything that would appear this wonderful brand Whole Foods has. So we don\u2019t expect it to be convert them to 40,000 square-foot warehouse. But I am sure they are going to use some of the store to \u2013 for pick-up, delivery etcetera from an Amazon standpoint. And lastly I think it reinforces our conviction about the importance of retailers being able to conveniently service their customers through bricks-and-mortar. It is and it remains the most efficient way to deliver the last mile.","Katy Mcconnell","Great. And are you seeing that other grocers are thinking about new development projects differently today as a result of the Amazon deal?","Hap Stein","No, I mean it\u2019s still early in the process. But we are working with several best in class grocers who are expanding and they are sticking to their expansion plans sometimes in market where they exist, sometimes new markets, but we haven\u2019t seen a shift in strategy or execution at this point.","Katy Mcconnell","Okay, great. Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Christy, Katy sorry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Yulico","Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to see at this point of the year what could push you to top or low end of your same-store NOI guidance?","Lisa Palmer","To your point that we are fairly halfway through the year and as you know at 3.5% year-to-date same-property NOI guidance puts us \u2013 I mean [indiscernible] same-property NOI growth puts us just below the midpoint of our guidance. So for this latter half of the year to even get to the midpoint would suggest that we are expecting some acceleration which is the case as redevelopments come online and also more a rent paying occupancy from the bankruptcy the bankrupt boxes from last year that we leased. So that plus if we have less than expected tenant fallout would put us towards the high end of the range. And the low end of the range would be if we have more than expected tenant fallout. But we have \u2013 we believe we have a fair amount of tenant fallout assumed in our guidance.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the \u2013 in the disposition market, I am wondering if you had noticed any changes there that may encourage you to sell even more assets?","Hap Stein","No, I wouldn\u2019t say that. I would say certainly nothing would change our plan. For the better properties, the higher quality ones, we don\u2019t think cap rates have changed really in the last couple of quarters they have held very solid. There is still a lot of competition for the best assets. For as you dropdown on the quality scale, cap rates have expanded on the real small markets and the weaker properties. But all-in-all, it\u2019s pretty steady out there. There is a lot of demand. Buyers are able to get equity and source debt and pretty solid all we are at and [indiscernible] for the product we have.","Lisa Palmer","And I would like to reinforce how we think about dispositions as part of our business model. Disposition are a source of capital for us. First, we have free cash flow which is projected to be north of $150 million for this year to fund our development spend. After that we will use dispositions. And as we spoke about in our prepared remarks, we have been able to use our free cash for our development spend to this point and we will be selling properties to fund the remainder throughout the year. And to the extent we do have an acquisitions team in place. We don\u2019t incorporate new acquisitions into our guidance. But to the extent that we are able to find a compelling opportunity we would increase our disposition guidance to fund that especially in light of the equity market today.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thanks every one.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","George Hoglund","Yes. Can you just provide a little bit of color on the change in development yields on the countryside shops in Point Royale?","Hap Stein","Sure I would be happy to. Our countryside shops the difference in yield is settled backtrack. But really the increase is in costs. And so last quarter we had written it as the first phase of the project. Now we have underwritten it to increase it by approximately $5 million to include a second phase of the project which is something we are going to go ahead with. So that\u2019s the difference, it\u2019s not cost first, it\u2019s a scope increase and it\u2019s not optional phase. Point Royale is a little bit different. Point Royale, the difference in yield has to do with, in the prior quarter we posted a return on a non-incremental basis, so on this quarter we posted as an incremental basis. So it\u2019s the incremental NOI divided by the project costs, which didn\u2019t materially change, that consistent with how we underwrite all projects and unfortunately last quarter we had used a different Equity One\u2019s underwriting criteria for that one.","Lisa Palmer","Just a little more color, I think as you heard us speak to in the prior calls and Mac specifically talked about it. We took of a really hard look at every in process Equity One redevelopment that we bought on March 1 and re-underwrote if you will with applying Regency\u2019s underwriting. And we just have different methods and as Mac said unfortunately in the supplemental last quarterly we applied their original underwriting rather than our own even though we have already done the work, so it\u2019s just an oversight.","Mac Chandler","You might have also noticed that the projected cost of Serramonte came down about $5 million. Now that we have a chance to really full get arms around that.","George Hoglund","Yes. Thanks. I appreciate the color. And then can you just also talked about either a watch list or whether sort of categories you may be looking at more closely for the back half of the years any things kind of on your radar has changed in the past couple of months?","Jim Thompson","Georges, this is Jim I will answer that one. No real surprises on the watch list on this year\u2019s toys are us, the Office Depot, Stables categories. But we continued to closely monitor other deteriorating categories, yesterday\u2019s apparel, casual dining and obviously the general department stores, but at the end of the day we continued to strategically evaluate those spaces, we have proactive re-leasing spots in place and we collect, we are prepared should we get that space back to react appropriately.","Hap Stein","Yes. And more often than not, a couple of things happen. Sometimes when the store closures, we have the kind of locations that are the must keep locations. Secondly, we have longer term leases. And thirdly more often than not bad news and abating good news, so not that we are immune, not that we are not \u2013 can\u2019t be negatively impacted, but more often than not long-term it\u2019s a positive thing for the merchandising the portfolio.","George Hoglund","Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thanks George.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the longer term projects that Equity One had Westwood Complex, Potrero Center, I know I jumped in the gun here, but any early thoughts on scope or yields on those projects and maybe you tie that into kind of changing landscape in retail and how that impacts your views on those projects?","Hap Stein","Sure, we would be happy to take that. Look, let\u2019s take one at a time. Westwood is a project that we are very excited about and we are digging that very carefully in [indiscernible] with existing giant who would love to be part of a redevelopment property. So we are change \u2013 we have changed sort of the mix of the project to reflect market conditions. And right now we are evaluating that considering selling some air rights to builders who want to do town homes, apartments or seniors or some combination of the three. So it\u2019s slightly different mix. We are probably suggesting less retail than Equity One had proposed. But we really we think at the end of the day, this is dynamic location. With a giant that has very well that will be part whatever future project that we ultimately decide on. And we also think because of the underlying entitlements, we should be in a position to start that project late next year. So coming together, but we don\u2019t have at this time anymore to announcing that. I will say let\u2019s jump to Potrero, that one is one of the longer range project. In any event it\u2019s going to take 3 years to 5 years to entitle it even with the great underlying entitlements that. We changed architects in that project and worked in the midst of setting all the different potentials. There is tremendous amount of density available to us. And we are not quite ready to make any announcements on that one. That\u2019s gong to take longer for us to ultimately program and ultimately approve. So I would plan on something like that for 3 years to 5 years from starting. Our recollection at Cambridge, that\u2019s more of a near-term project, it takes three steps to get the entitlements. We are through the first step and that we are working on the second step which is the planning commission. That should be in a position to start late next year as well. And that\u2019s a little more straightforward where we know it\u2019s going to be a combination of retail and office. And will redevelop some of the buildings and then raise and rebuild others to create a cohesive project in a terrific location. So larger that overall changes that on the landscape apartment. We are still very disciplined about the amount of shops that we propose, about the anchors that we suggest. And we are only working with the best in class tenant. We have recognized that when you bring in other uses such as multifamily, it takes some time to find the right partner and we are patient about doing that. And we want to make sure our risk adjusted returns are appropriate. But at this point we don\u2019t have really good guidance on those returns because we are still evaluating a lot of different possibilities.","Mac Chandler","And I would just say Ki Bin that in our view and obviously I think you guys see through the headlines but at the same time the retail landscape has changed, it\u2019s the changes accelerating, but we still feel that highly productive grocers, restaurants, service users, fitness, pet and working where there is room, big box users with best in class retailers like T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, Nordstrom, Ross and Ulta it remains a compelling combination that makes sense today and it\u2019s going to make sense for the foreseeable future, but the retail landscape and our tenant mix is going to continue to change and evolve.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thanks. And what do you think it\u2019s the end game in maybe 5 years of how the grocer landscape looks like and I almost don\u2019t care what the grocers are saying to you, but more so what do you think, do you think this is less grocers in the market, at this time curious on how that looks like in your view?","Hap Steins","Well, number one, I think it does start with Kroger, Publix, H-E-B, Wegmans are really good operators. They have extensive irreplaceable platforms that are conveniently located to the customers. And they are focusing on not only technology and click and collect, for instance, Kroger in 2015 had zero-click and collect locations they call a quick lift and they have I think its 700 today. So these changes are rolling these out. But they are also focused on enhancing pricing to be competitive. And they realize that they got to provide an exciting store experience. But what\u2019s going to happen is the weaker change are not going to be able to compete, not going to be able to invest the capital and the same time something stronger operators are to be unwilling to invest capital in the weaker locations. So we feel, they are going to face challenges, but these changes when you think about it and you look at the challenges that Walmart, I mean Walmart 15 years ago had de minimis market share and they have what is 25% today and these chains are still surviving. They have adapted. They have got better. So they will be 40,000 grocery store locations that are out there \u2013 our plan is that take 15%, 20%, 25% are going to be closed in the next 3 years to 5 years with the locations that we have are ones where $32 million in sales, $650 per square foot over where bad news is going to be good news.","Mac Chandler","And occupancy costs less than\u2026","Hap Steins","And what actually was cost less than 2%.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning everyone. Just sticking with the grocer topic here for a second, I was just curious I mean Amazon buying Whole Foods, clearly is going to cause some changes in the overall space, it sounds like you are not really seeing any changes in execution or strategy as of yet, but just from your opinion amended do you think that and you mentioned the click and collect for the one retailer, but do you think on net that the grocers have invested enough in the sort of omnichannel world and are they going to play catch up for a while and do you think they have the margins to what sort of to pay for all that?","Hap Steins","Kroger has and I mean the comments that we made is that in general there are still supermarket, grocery chains that are expanding. Whether that\u2019s in the case of Publix, in the case of Wegmans, they are continuing the pace. In the case of Kroger they have announced that they are going to take the capital that has been invested in store expansion, investing that in technology. We think that\u2019s a good thing for us, it may make the development opportunities that get less, we feel like we are going to get more than our fair share. But I think they have recognize and are making significant investments. Sometimes it makes impact their store expansion, but they are going to invest in technology, so they cannot only compete with Amazon\/Whole Foods, but they can also compete with Walmart, they can also compete with all these and they also can compete with Lido.","Lisa Palmer","I think it\u2019s important to note that my opinion I think shared by those around the table. The purchase of Whole Foods by Amazon didn\u2019t change the end game. Amazon was intent on figuring out the grocery business. And the operators that operated in the grocery industry they knew that as well. So they had already \u2013 there were already talking about it, already strategically thinking about how they can compete, how they cannot maintain their share, but also grow their share in this new ultra competitive environment. The only thing that changed is potentially the pace of that changed. And I think that they are aware of that. And that when the announcement was made there was no doubt in my mind that every grocery operator called an immediate management meeting and sat down at the table and said what do we need to do differently, what we need to do faster. But the things that they were already focused on competing in the in the world of e-commerce and so these are really sophisticated operators with irreplaceable platforms.","Hap Stein","And Kroger\u2019s click lift and Albertson has a similar program, Publix has a similar program. But these like I indicated Kroger started rolling it out in 2015 this was something that they adapted from their acquisition of Harris Teeter. And that was obviously several years before Amazon\u2019s announcement that they were going to buy Whole Foods. Once again, we are not \u2013 the markets, the landscape is going to change, the landscape is going to be more challenging. We are not going to be immune to some of the fall out, but we think that we are very well positioned to not only survive, but to for shopping centers, but to perform real well and there is going to be some opportunities there come out of this.","Vincent Chao","Sure, I wasn\u2019t trying to suggest that I guests who have not been preparing for this, but to the extent that the does accelerate things that that was more the question?","Hap Stein","And it is I am sure [indiscernible] with what Lisa said based upon our conversations those meetings did take place.","Vincent Chao","Right, you would expect that to be the case. Maybe different topic, not that every time when your peers buy the portfolio that you have to have looked at it maybe you did, maybe didn\u2019t, but I was just curious in general, the Prime Store acquisitions that Federal had announced, just that strategy of may be going more specifically after a particular demographic or ethnic group, is that something that you guys are thinking about more seriously or and is there certain markets that that would make sense for you guys?","Hap Stein","Let me say this, we looked at that in past, it is a \u2013 and let me say this Federal is a very sophisticated and downward a very sophisticated capital allocators and we have got a tremendous amount of respect for them. And I am sure they will make good on this investment. But we have looked at this in the past and we feel that the best rather having a separate strategy, the best way for us to continue to have shopping centers that are going to grow in a while and they are going to grow and perform as they stick with our strategy and we think part of that we have shopping centers that are in highly large percentage of the Hispanic American communities with large and such center for Asian percentages of Asian populations and we found there is a lot of similarities there and I think we are going to continue to execute on that basis. Mac do you want to?","Mac Chandler","Well, I would say just living in Los Angeles, we are very familiar with the properties there and the opportunity set. And I understand what they are doing, they are trying to get a little better growth and they may accomplish that. But I don\u2019t \u2013 I like the strategy we have on a one-off basis where we like neighborhoods with a lot of purchasing power with best in class tenants. So we can continue to execute what we are doing and we think we are \u2013 we have the best approach. Of course we feel very comfortable with.","Hap Stein","Best for us.","Mac Chandler","It\u2019s best for us.","Vincent Chao","Right, okay. Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Samir Khanal","Good morning guys. On the disposition that you have the $100 million to $200 million which remains unchanged and it looks like it\u2019s towards the back half of the year, I mean are there any sort of my guess would be these are more sort of Equity One assets or are they one-off assets, are they sort of markets you are looking to exit?","Hap Stein","Well, I would sit there through one-off assets, it\u2019s on our portfolio. We have several properties under contract and somewhat where we are negotiating with buyers. The way in which we select the properties to sell hasn\u2019t changed over time. There are properties where they may have limited growth, they may be in a market they may have some tenants at risk or just ones where we just don\u2019t have the best believes that they will outperform the rest of the center. So we have seen good reaction from the buying community as you put properties under contract. And the plan hasn\u2019t changed, it\u2019s to sell 1% to 2% of our assets. So it doesn\u2019t look like we have sold much today and that\u2019s the fact, but we have several properties where we are coming together in terms with buyers and we expect to execute and hit our guidance y the end of the year.","Lisa Palmer","I think Hap and I were going to say the same thing, but it\u2019s a mix of legacy Regency and Equity One properties.","Samir Khanal","Okay. And then I guess my next question I have is on the Equity One portfolio sort of putting that portfolio side-by-side with yours, just from a internal growth standpoint, is there \u2013 where is the opportunity there, do you have opportunity maybe sort of increase just of the annual contractual rent bumps, is there an ability to sort of push occupancy maybe on the smaller shops side or even or maybe increase rent spreads at this point, so I guess where is the biggest opportunity just when you think about it sort of ex redevelopment internal growth standpoint here?","Lisa Palmer","If you recall when we initially talked about the strategic benefits of the combined portfolio when \u2013 and then when we closed on March 1, so we initially talked about it. One of the strategic benefits was an enhanced same-property NOI growth rate. It\u2019s hard to exclude redevelopments because that is the piece of it. And then on March 1 when we closed we significantly increased our same-property NOI growth guidance for the year. And that enhanced same property NOI growth for \u201817 and also for the next couple of years is coming from a variety of things. One, Equity One had just done a very good job of acquiring properties that were \u2013 that had lease rent rolls essentially with leases below market and so there was just inherent upside as leases are rolling. And we are beginning to achieve some of that. They had done a fantastic job in the very recent past of actually leasing up their shop space, but there is still room and as evidenced by our results this quarter, so some of it\u2019s coming from there. And then they were great operators, but I am a little biased and I think we have got the best team in the business. And I think that we can apply our expertise in the field to enhancing those contractual rent steps. And again increasing occupancy, so you obviously exclude redevelopment, but that\u2019s also a piece of it because I also believe that that best team in the business applies to our ability to create value at these shopping centers. And again the Equity One team had build a really nice portfolio of properties that essentially increased our menu of opportunities to create value. So all of that will continue to enhance our same-property NOI growth for \u2013 and for at least the next couple of years and then we will get to a much more stable, stabilized run rate.","Samir Khanal","Okay, thank you.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Samir.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question ","Craig Schmidt","Great, thank you. I wanted to focus on the accelerating leasing volume you guys went from $1 million in the first quarter out of $1.7 million in the second quarter, incredible pickup. I just wonder was it anchor small shops part of new projects or was it mainly re-leasing in existing properties?","Lisa Palmer","Craig, I mean, unfortunately didn\u2019t restate all of our statistics for kind of the comparable larger portfolio. So, a lot of that is just from the fact that we are just larger. The only thing that was adjusted was the same property NOI table.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, great and thank you. And then on the Whole Foods that you own, I mean, there has been a lot of talk and speculation that they are going to use these stores as distribution in pickup and delivery, that may require some changes to the property? I assume that\u2019s an opportunity for you to be able to charge higher rent for any kind of changes they want to make on property sale lease from you?","Hap Stein","I think we have been very accommodating to the grocery stores in the past as far as pickup and deliveries as long as there is not a significant amount of capital involved there and my sense is just reiterate this, because this will evolve over time, but the vast majority of the Whole Foods space is going to continue to be as Whole Foods is today. I would also be \u2013 I would be very surprised if they didn\u2019t \u2013 that wasn\u2019t the case, but I\u2019d also be surprised if they didn\u2019t take a small portion of that space and devote it to distribution, pickup and delivery.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, great. Thanks.","Lisa Palmer","Thanks, Craig.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wes Golladay","Hello, everyone. Looking at the development across commercial real estate, we are seeing delays on construction due to subcontractor issues and also in some cases finding the right inspector to show up on time. It looks you actually pulled forward the anchor opening of 1 year projects and yields are stable if not increasing. So, wondering if you are not seeing this and how are you mitigating the other risk of delays?","Hap Stein","Mac and the team are really good. I think we are going to look [indiscernible] because unfortunately that is a fact of life these days. Cities have fewer inspectors than they used to and subcontractors have a wide array of job to bid on. So, I think we have budgeted well to account for it, but we haven\u2019t been surprised by the events. So, our schedules and our budgets presume this is going to happen. And I don\u2019t see that will be changing in the future. So, it has been and still is and maybe even more so. It\u2019s scheduling, timing and cost controls are obviously major challenges all the time and historically have been from a construction standpoint and that\u2019s still very, very much the case today. So, we obviously have a lot of focus and the team really has done a very nice job of addressing that issue.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thank you.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Wes.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. It\u2019s a quick one. Is selling the Barneys lease a 2018 or \u201819 event and maybe you can comment on the sales productivity in that store?","Hap Stein","We consider all assets as best as far as what goes on our distribution list and where those are prioritized and don\u2019t specifically talk about any assets. And I would answer it that way, no matter what \u2013 no matter what assets you asked me about there. I mean, we focus \u2013 and I will also say given we don\u2019t want to be driven by the headlines, but given by what\u2019s happening in the business today, you can be assured and you can imagine we have once again thoroughly vetted the full portfolio and we prioritized those assets that have the lowest growth prospects and it makes sense to sell.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Mas, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you, Mr. Mas. You may now begin.","Michael Mas","Good Morning, and welcome to Regency's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, our President and COO; Lisa Palmer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","We also request that callers observe a 2-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Later on the call Lisa and Brian will cover the exceptional results that Regency delivered in all facets of the business in 2014. I would like to first take this opportunity to briefly review the extent of what Regency's team has accomplished over the last 3 years.","We increased percent leased in our operating portfolio of more than 200 basis points to nearly 96%, while rent growth grew to 12%. We achieved same property NOI growth of 4% for 3 straight years. This was driven by the combination of our high-quality portfolio, historically low levels of new supply and robust tenant demand across our markets from anchors, small shop retailers and restaurants. We completed the development of more than $500 million of high-quality shopping centers that are generating average returns of 8%.","With the current spread between our developing yields and existing market cap rates, we continue to create value for our shareholders by capitalizing on these distinguishing core competency. We astutely manage our balance sheet that compares favorably other REITs with a net debt to EBITDA among the lowest in the sector. And in spite of the investments to enhance the balance sheet, we averaged nearly 6% annual core FFO per share growth. These achievements translated into returns for shareholders approaching 90%, which represents a substantial outperformance of the shopping center peer average.","Even though I'm proud of these results and Regency's progress, I'm even more excited about Regency's future prospects. Brian, Lisa and I firmly believe that we will continue to distinguish Regency and grow shareholder value by persistently executing Regency's tried and true strategy of, first, sustaining superior NOI growth from a high-quality portfolio that is primarily grocery anchored. Second, developing and redeveloping great shopping centers at compelling spreads. Third, enhancing a strong balance sheet through organic earnings growth and cost effective match funding. And finally, engaging and focusing a talented team that is employing best-in-class operating systems.","Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap, and good morning, everyone. Our 2014 results were strong. In summary, core FFO per share was $2.82 for the year, representing an increase of more than 7%. Full year same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was 4%, including a net positive impact from redevelopments of 70 basis points. And as Hap said, this marks the third consecutive year of 4% NOI growth. Importantly, base rent growth continues to be the largest contributing factor.","The portfolio averaged 95% leased throughout the year ending at 95.8% and spaces less than 10,000 square feet gained 90 basis points year-over-year, ending the year at 91% leased. As Hap said, we are proud of how we've enhanced an already strong balance sheet by taking measured steps to deleverage and capitalizing on opportunities.","Cost effectively maintaining a conservative balance sheet through organic earnings growth and match funding remains a critical component of our strategy. The forward equity offering we completed in January, together with our fourth quarter ATM activity is consistent with this strategy. In terms of the forward sale, the amount of capital was committed to us at the share price on the offering date, and then we will draw down the proceeds and issue the shares over the next 12 months as the identified uses occur.","As for the use, we closed 2 acquisitions in the last weeks of December and are working to close an additional acquisition opportunity. We will also fund development spent throughout 2015 and address our unsecured bond maturity in August. In addition to this forward sale, we also raised approximately $55 million through our ATM during the quarter.","With respect to our earnings outlook for 2015, as noted in our press release in January, the offering has no impact on our previously released guidance for core FFO per share. The only impact is to acquisitions and dispositions. Our updated acquisition guidance range of $0 million to $80 million captures a potential opportunity and we reduced the high end of the disposition guidance by $65 million. In essence, a $145 million net increase in capital required for 2015. And the offering is the funding source for this capital requirement.","Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I also want to express how pleased I am with the fourth quarter and the 2014 operating results and the continued strength of the portfolio. I'm proud of 5.3% fourth quarter same property NOI growth and I'm certainly proud of full year NOI growth of 4%. But especially for achieving it 3 years in a row and also ending the year at 95.8% leased.","What we've accomplished in terms of development is equally gratifying. In 2014, we started a $160 million of new ground up projects and completed nearly $100 million of high-quality shopping centers at close to 97% leased. These 4 completions had an average return on incremental costs approaching 10%.","I introduced most of these development starts on prior calls with the exception of our fourth quarter start, The Village at La Floresta. La Floresta will be an 87,000 square foot Whole Foods anchored center located in North Orange County in California. It boasts very strong local trade demographics with average household income of $105,000 and a population of 113,000.","The project is already 75% leasing committed and is projected to generate a spread of approximately 250 basis points, above private market cap rates. The fresh look design, tenancy and placemaking features at La Floresta will clearly place it as one of the top neighborhood and community shopping centers in Orange County.","Despite the height in competition, I expect our development capabilities and presence in target markets, as well as relationships with key retailers, will enable us to continue to deliver an average of $150 million to $200 million of developments and redevelopments annually.","In terms of fourth quarter acquisition activity, as Lisa said, we acquired 2 properties in December. The first, Indian Springs is an ATB-anchored center located in The Woodlands master planned community, North of Houston. We've owned a 50% interest in this property for some time and we acquired our partner's remaining interest this quarter for nearly $27 million.","Our second acquisition is Broadway Market, a mixed center located in the heart of Seattle. The center encompasses an entire block in Seattle's more densely populated neighborhood Capitol Hill, which has a population of 223,000 and average annual incomes approaching $100,000. It has a 111,000 square feet of retail and 30 residential units, and is anchored by Kroger's QFC banner with very strong sales volumes.","These acquisitions, together with those previously announced, as well as the developments we've completed and the properties that we sold during the last 3 years, have combined to enhance a portfolio that by all measures was already one of the best in the country.","I'd like to briefly comment on Albertsons' purchase of Safeway and the merger between Staples and Office Depot. As you know, Safeway and Albertsons are divesting 168 stores. Six of the stores are in our portfolio and will be acquired by Haggen. One of the properties is in Seattle market, where Haggen has strong brand recognition as a good operator. The other 5 properties are in Southern California where Haggen will be new to the market. In any event, the real estate is strong and the leases are at very low rents.","The office supply sectors problems are nothing new. We've been evaluating the situation for some time and have proactively worked to reduce our exposure. Today we have 11 fewer office supply stores in our portfolio than we did in 2009. The remaining 17 stores represent less than 1% of base rent. More importantly, they are located in great centers, with 15 of 17 internally graded as A properties.","We think there will be significant demand for these boxes given the very limited supply of quality junior anchored space on the market nationwide. In any event, we have plenty of time to deal with the issue, as the merger will not be finalized until year-end and only 3 other leases have terms that expire prior to 2017.","Tenant store closings are part of the constantly evolving nature of retail, which our teams anticipate. We aggressively and proactively manage our portfolio, and whether we're dealing with chain-wide problems or simply want to upgrade the merchandising mix, we're way out in front of the issue.","In summary, we've spent a great 3 years. While I'm certainly proud of what we've accomplished, I look forward to continuing our progress and producing the results we desire and expect. The quality of our portfolio, our team's dogged ability to execute on our strategy and the current market backdrop give me confidence that positive momentum will continue into 2015.","Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Brain. Thank you, Lisa. I would like to close by reaffirming our focus on excelling in each facet of the business. Growing earnings, NAV and shareholder value, and distinguishing Regency among our peers and within the REIT sector.","We thank you for your time and we'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The 2005 same-store NOI midpoint of 3.5% is lower than the 4% in 2014 and the 5.3% in your fourth quarter. I just wonder what are some of the factors that are impacting you to guide on that slightly lower performance?","Lisa Palmer","Craig, it's Lisa. I'll start and look to Brian to add any color. First, I think, I'd be remiss if didn't say how proud we were of the fact that we did achieve 4% for 3 consecutive years. And remind you, even pointing to some of our prepared remarks, that our strategic goal is to sustain 3%-plus NOI, same property NOI growth. And obviously, you know our sector well, even that's not necessarily going to be easy for everyone to achieve, but we believe that we will be able to sustain 3% NOI growth because of the quality of the portfolio, as well as some of the redevelopment efforts that we're doing. And so if you think about the components of growth, over the last 3 years, we have had some lift from increasing our percent leased and then also narrowing the gap of percent leased to percent rent commenced. So we've had some of that and that contributed to our 2014 growth. And then looking to 2015, we'll still gain some from having more rent paying tenants. But clearly, that is decelerating just from the fact that we're nearly 96% leased.","Brian M. Smith","Yes. Craig, I guess I would add that -- there's a few things. While we have really strong base rent growth than we're forecasting, I think, we will continue to see the kind of results that we've been turning over the last 3 years in that regard. We may be conservative right now at this point in terms of looking at prior year recoveries and we're showing some drag there, time will tell that we can do better than that. We certainly hope so. And then we're up against some pretty big other income, things last year like a payment from Kroger in Ohio and [indiscernible] that we sold out in California. We haven't identified anything specifically to replace those. So there's probably a little bit of conservatism until we have better clarity on those.","Martin E. Stein","And just finally, I'll pipe in and say, it would be really nice on this call next year to be able to say 4% 4 years in a row, and the team is really focused on enabling up. Brian, Lisa and I had a talk about that.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Sounds like you'll be going for the four-peat.","Lisa Palmer","Yes.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just -- one question just because you guys do have a broad focus geographically. Are -- I know your Houston exposures isn't all that great. But what are your expectation is the impact on oil on those shopping centers? And are you hearing anything to date?","Brian M. Smith","I don't think, Craig, that the impact on us is going to be meaningful at all. I mean, first of all, the economy overall is very diversified. There's -- it's been white-hot. I think it's fair to say that there's got to be a deceleration, but Houston is a strong market, Texas is going to continue to grow. I think, the impact is going to be probably greater on office and multifamily. If you just look at our portfolio, it's been established there for a long time, it's in very affluent areas. Our average household income in that portfolio is $140,000 and we're occupied greater than 98%. So -- and they're also mostly master planned communities with the Woodlands and Cinco Ranch and the likes. So you've got some protection. I think if we had some land that we closed on with the expectation of maybe some office mixed use it might be a different story, but there's none of that going on.","Operator","The next question is from across from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jeremy Metz, I'm with Ross. Just thinking about the small shop side today, can you talk about -- have you seen an increase in mom-and-pops looking for -- to lease space? Or is this still largely national and regional tenants taking space then? And second part of that, your occupancy is now 91% for the small space. How much higher do you think you can push it and sort of what's baked in the guidance for '15?","Brian M. Smith","I don't -- we haven't seen much difference. I'll tell you the leasing is still about 20% mom-and-pops. I think it's important that we identify kind of what we mean by mom-and-pops. None of the retailers or restaurants that we're dealing with would be first-time operators who just decided to open up a business. I mean, these are people who have been in business, they're either -- it may be that they have 1, 2, 3 stores. And we're really big on, frankly, having local operators. Because if you look at the whole millennials, what are you reading in all the researches? That they like new, they like fresh, they like authentic, they like local. And they can react, particularly the restaurants, faster than the national chains. So we do about 20%. And just kind of some examples of the people that we deal with would be -- that we call mom-and-pops, would be Lily Rain in Houston. This was the guy who started Francesca's chain, took it public and then decided to leave that and he opened up his first store at our Woodway Center in Houston. Out in California, this guy, Chicken Charlie's, he was on ABC News. He's got tremendous publicity and press because of his operation which he ran out of a food truck. We opened him at Balboa and have lines out the door and the press is covering him now just because of the sensation. In terms of where we are now. We're at 91%. I think we will -- we should be able to blow through 92%. Don't know exactly how high it goes, but I would tell you our pipeline today is stronger than it has been in some time. It's about 50% of the remaining vacant spaces have activity going on right now, whereas the last 4 quarters average is more like about 43%. So I think it's going to keep going, and I'm not sure how high it gets.","Lisa Palmer","And Jeremy, I will just add from just a pure mathematical standpoint. If you look at our percent lease for our anchors being nearly 99% leased and our guidance for 2015 of actually the high end of percent lease guidance being 96.5%, that obviously all have to come from small shop space.","Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that color. And then second one for me. Lisa, just -- with the debt coming due, obviously, I think $250 million of the hedge and then just -- it looks like with the forward equity offering, you're obviously choosing to use that method to pay down some of that in order to bridge that gap versus using the term loan that you have existing. Just some of the thinking there versus using the term loan given what the rate it's at, it's pretty cheap cost of capital there.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. Just to remind you that we did decrease our disposition guidance. So the equity is going to fund some of our new investment as well. And then we do have a $350 million bond maturity in August. We've hedged, basically, $250 million of that. The acquisition opportunity that we've also identified as a use for our forward equity actually has a mortgage on it. So we'll be assuming some debt, cash is more or less spongeable. So the debt that we're assuming on that property, in essence, is what we'll -- we're going to be applying that and paying down the bond, if you will. So instead of refinancing at the full $350 million, we'll probably do somewhere between $250 million and $300 million. Does that make sense?","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Appreciate the color.","Operator","The next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Brian, just wanted to follow-up on The Village at La Floresta. Can you discuss the competitive landscape of that location? It seems like there's a fair bit of grocery presence already including 2 Sprouts nearby. And then just given the number of Whole Food deals you have in the pipeline, can you talk a little bit about the extent of your partnership with them in regards to development and new location?","Brian M. Smith","Sure, Christy. Actually what's interesting about La Floresta is I wouldn't call Sprouts a full-service gourmet grocery store. This is the only full-service gourmet grocery store in North Orange County. The nearest Whole Foods is 15 miles away. So what we're finding is, because there is such demand for that kind of use that we're literally getting our pick of the litter when it comes to the small shops, which is one of the reasons why we emphasized in the introductory remarks the merchandising aspect of our Fresh Look approach to this. Whole Foods, we -- as you know, we did 5 new development starts with them this year. We have come a long way with them. If you look at the end of 2008, we had 4 Whole Foods in the portfolio. Today, we have 17 and we have a pipeline of another 11. And that's combination of development, redevelopment and the acquisition that's coming probably this next quarter or this quarter. So we just think the world of them. Anytime we have a Whole Foods, you can guarantee that it's an area that has both high income and high education, because those are the 2 most important criteria they look for. And those are areas, obviously, where you have the ability to grow household income and enhance drive sales and drive rents.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then Lisa, just to follow-up on some of the question on same store NOI guidance. Can you just remind me, does your same store NOI growth include the impact of redevelopment? And then just looking at 3% to 4% forecast in the component, can you give us a sense for what leasing spread could look like this year? Does your higher occupancy give you sort of more pricing power? Or if you get up into 96%-plus occupancy range, is that incremental leasing sort of that harder to lease space that you can see lower spreads on?","Lisa Palmer","Brian said he'll take the leasing spreads. I'll follow-up with the same property.","Brian M. Smith","Yes. I mean, the leasing spreads, we expect would continue to be strong. The fundamentals are strong. We know there's no new supply with this tremendous demand out there. And we also know that from our own experience that as soon as you get to 95% lease, you definitely have more pricing power, just pure supply demand. I think if you look at 2014, the difference between those centers that were over 95% and those that were under 95%, have about 420 basis points difference in the rent growth spreads. So we're starting to get -- we're -- we got pricing power in almost all of the markets now. I mean, if you look even at the markets that have lagged today that have maybe been a drag on rent growth, North Florida, Arizona and Sacramento and Central Valley, all of those markets are at least 95% having enjoyed real strong occupancy gain. So I think it's certainly -- there's nothing that would make us less optimistic that we'd be in double-digit rent growth for next year.","Lisa Palmer","And then on the same property, we do include the impact of redevelopments for the quarter. It was 100 basis points and 70 basis points for the full year, positive.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Carlington of Green Street Advisors.","Jay Carlington","Lisa, I think you mentioned the strength in the base rent component this quarter. So curious what's driving that? Is that higher rent steps? Or redevelopment? Or are there any onetime items in there?","Lisa Palmer","I'll let Brian -- I mean, basically, nothing onetime. It's percent, basically, effective rent paying or percent commence, whatever you want -- whichever term you want to use, that's significantly increased. And then also just higher percent -- just higher rent steps. What the team has been really focused on, getting mid-term rent steps, more contractual rent steps at a higher rate. And we've made a lot of progress towards that. But I'll let Brian add some color.","Brian M. Smith","Yes. No, it's -- again, it's kind of odd view to sort of well balance. We had some other income, as mentioned earlier. The rent steps Lisa just talked to were very strong. I mean, in the fourth -- I'm sorry, the rent steps were 2% for all leases versus 1.3% for the whole portfolio. So I'm not sure if that answers it...","Martin E. Stein","It's across-the-board, but primarily -- it's the underlying fundamentals of, basically, base rent growing.","Jay Carlington","Okay. Okay. Great. And maybe switching gears...","Lisa Palmer","And base rent, obviously, also impacted just by the strong rental rate growth we've had over the past year as well. I mean, that's all -- everything contributing to it. And we expect that to continue into 2015.","Jay Carlington","Okay. Great. And maybe switching gears. I know we haven't talked about your land bank in a while. I'm just kind of curious that $56 million in market value you have there. What do you think has happened to that value of that land over the last year? And maybe as a follow-up, what's left in that bucket?","Brian M. Smith","I don't think it's necessarily increasing value. It's down from about a $150 million a few years ago, probably one of the biggest pieces in it was a project that we're starting out in Southern California, it's going to be a development with Target, Lowe's and several others, had it all leased and then the market went bad. And I think, it looks like we've got activity on that, we would like to see that sell this year. We're kind of hoping that we reduce that by another $10 million in 2015.","Jay Carlington","Is that all allocated...","Lisa Palmer","Let me just -- I'm sorry, Jay, let me clarify. Were you -- you were talking about the expansion land that's adjacent to our properties that's on our guidance page or were you talking about land bank. Because those are different. Because we mark land to market every quarter, but not if it's adjacent to an operating property and it's not -- basically, on the balance sheet separately.","Jay Carlington","Okay. So all that $56 million or so, that's just -- without parcels and land next to your current?","Lisa Palmer","Correct.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It looks like you have 6 co-investment relationships. And if you're looking out, say, the next 3 to 5 years, does that number stay static? Does it go higher? Does it go lower?","Lisa Palmer","I would expect that it would stay static. We're really happy with our partners. As you know, Mike, that they were an important part of our growth when you look back 15 years. And over the past more recent years, they've stayed pretty static.","Martin E. Stein","I think, as a percentage of our NOI that's involved in partnerships has incrementally come down and I think it will continue to come down. And we're not looking to add any new institutional partnerships at this point.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Are they expanding? Like what portion of them are expanding?","Martin E. Stein","I think, they'd like to expand, but we're -- and we did the Broadway acquisition up in Seattle with our partnership with the State of Oregon. And also, I'll remind everyone that we have distributions in kind in all of our partnerships. So to the extent that those partnership -- we end those relationships, and there's no desire to do that, we've got great partners, we would end up with our pro rata share of properties.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Sullivan of Cowen and Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wonder, you have this -- given that the new development pipeline that's been expanding and it's expanding in many different markets, I wonder if you could kind of remind us, number one, what kind of a limit, if any, do you have or do you think about in terms of how much of your capital you want to be allocating to ground up new development, number one? And number two, I think, Christy alluded to it earlier, clearly, Whole Foods is expanding. I wonder if you could just give us a feel for the ground up development with the gross or anchored centers. Is it because of the anchors entering new markets? Or is it because of the anchors looking to just have a newer better footprint into the existing market?","Martin E. Stein","I will make a quick stab at the second part of that question, and I think the answer is yes. I think they're looking for better footprints, better infill locations and sometimes new markets. But the anchors focus has been more infill and that's been aligned with what our current focus is. From a capital allocation standpoint, we have established a guideline of -- or a limit of 2x EBITDA as far as our exposure, including our future commitments to development. And that's a little bit under $900 million. And that's something that ought to grow organically is our -- in effect, our balance sheet grows. At this point in time, we're less than half of that number. We're still looking to -- looking for opportunities, but there's not as many opportunities that meet our criteria as far as the opportunity to develop great shopping centers at compelling spreads. But we do feel in spite of competitive landscape, I think as Brian indicated and I indicated on my remarks, we ought to be able to average $150 million, $200 million of new developments and redevelopments a year. We could do somewhat more than that if compelling opportunities that met the criteria were available.","Brian M. Smith","And Jim, while we're heavy on Publix this year, I mean, we certainly are not limited to just them. I think it was reported in one of the news outlets that we're working on a Wegmans opportunity, and that's real. We think the world of them. We got Kroger concepts that we're working on. So we're doing a lot of different grocers. And in terms of where we're doing them, it's -- we have some where the grocer is moving into a new market, most of you like the Publix like we started at Willow Oaks in North Carolina, as Publix has moved up into Charlotte. But by and large, it's high barrier markets where it's tough to get stores going. And I think, La Floresta is an example of that. Whole Foods have been trying to get the North Orange County for a long time. They're certainly well represented in Orange County and in a lot -- in the whole Southern California area. But it just takes time to do those. Same thing with Belmont in Washington DC, and that's a master planned community that's been in the works for many, many years. And that was our only opportunity since there will be one grocery center in that development. So mostly it's infill in existing markets, but every now and then we have something like the Publix still to go into a new market.","Operator","Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about your G&A cost run rate in the fourth quarter, it looks like your gross G&A went up. Pretty measurably but also your capitalized portion of that went up, which is major net G&A looked pretty static, I'm just curious what the run rate looks like going to 2015. And if there's any reasons why those things change during the quarter?","Lisa Palmer","No. The G&A was higher in the fourth quarter. There's a portion of our incentive comp plan that's not finalized until the fourth quarter. So we'll always see more in G&A in the fourth quarter assuming that we have incentive comp to pay more in the fourth quarter than in the prior quarters. We do accrue for some, but not for all. And then for our guidance for G&A that we provided in mid-December was flat to up 3.5%, and that remains unchanged.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","But the capitalized portion is that just -- is it just a pro rata movement?","Lisa Palmer","Again, the capitalized piece is -- the part of this incentive comp that we don't finalize until the fourth quarter is related to our development program. And so a lot of that, that was -- that happened in the fourth quarter was actually capitalized -- capitalizable incentive comp. And it's just a result of our increased development activity. And we would expect selling into 2015 that capitalized development costs will actually be down some. But still in the -- not as high $16 million but stays in the $12 million to $15 million range.","Martin E. Stein","That incentive comp is paid based upon development performance on the back end once the properties are complete and leased up. And that's -- just so you know, it's the field that earns that -- will earn that incentive compensation.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And that all gets factored into the development yields that you disclosed, right?","Lisa Palmer","Of course. Yes.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And just the last quick one. What is the average cash rent step up for your portfolio on average?","Lisa Palmer","I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","What is average cash rent step up that your portfolio generates in any given year? The embedded bumps?","Lisa Palmer","You mean, the mid-term contractual rent steps.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Yes.","Lisa Palmer","Okay.","Brian M. Smith","So for the entire portfolio, our midyear rent steps are 1.3%. Although as I mentioned earlier, we have really been focused on that part of the business for the last of couple years. And for 2014, all the leases we signed had an average of 2% rent bumps and we get it 87% of the time, which is a lot higher than historically is in the average.","Martin E. Stein","So our objective is to take that 1.3% contribution to NOI growth up to 1.5% or 1.6%.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","My question is around the acquisition outlook. Just curious, again, if there are opportunities to do transactions of decently large portfolios in markets that you guys want to get more of a presence, and very similar to what you were trying to do with AmREIT, whether those kind of opportunities exist either in the private or public markets?","Martin E. Stein","There's a limited number of large -- I mean, of portfolio opportunities and\/or one-off opportunities that meet our criteria that have superior NOI growth. And just once again, when we buy a shopping center, we're going to finance it, primarily or kind of our go-to financing is sell a shopping center at roughly comparable cap rates that has a much lower growth rate. But it's a very competitive market out there and not a lot that meet our criteria. But our team works very -- Brian's team work very, very diligently to find market transactions and has had a decent amount of success for finding great centers with good upside.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So that's helpful. And then just one more question on the small shop side. If you could just talk about any change in regards to demand from new types of tenant for that space or is it still kind of the same group of people who have been seen in the past 12 months to 18 months?","Brian M. Smith","I think it's pretty much the same. I mean when we talk about the retailers that are doing well, those are the ones that are looking to expand. And that has a long list. But primarily, I would say the common thread would be anything that's related to health, whether that's restaurants, whether it's exercise places, athletic apparel, massages, those are really the ones that are in big demand. There's very few categories I'd say that where the retailers are struggling and aren't really looking in -- and you know that list, it hasn't changed, toys, office, tanning supplies, dry cleaners, books. Other than that, it remains very vibrant across-the-board.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management.","Martin E. Stein","We thank you and appreciate your time. And wish everybody a great President's Day weekend. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Mas. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Mas","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank everyone for joining us today. On today's call, you will hear from our Chairman and CEO, Hap Stein; our President and COO, Brian Smith; our CFO, Lisa Palmer; and Senior Vice President and Treasurer, Chris Leavitt.","Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the earnings call.","This morning, I'd like to briefly share my assessment on how well Regency's portfolio, balance sheet and development program are now situated and how we have positioned them to grow future shareholder value. To begin with, there's a number -- as you're all aware, there have been a number of recently published research reports, and many of those reports have compared the portfolios in the shopping center sector. And pretty much every one of them have described Regency's portfolio as clearly one of the highest quality portfolios in the shopping center sector.","In my view, 4 key attributes of the portfolio stand out. First on average, our grocery anchors generate more than $27.5 million in sales, and this represents a 9% increase in just the last 2 years and equates to more than $530 per square foot. Second, the average household income within 3 miles of our centers is $100,000, which is substantially higher than the peer average. Third, our average base rents in the portfolio are also meaningfully above the peer average. And finally, the percentage leased for small shops, and being able to attract terrific small shops as a good indicator of quality, remains one of the highest in the sector.","Continuing on this topic of portfolio quality, since 2010, we've enhanced what was already a darn good portfolio through the sale of more than $800 million of nonstrategic assets and the acquisition of $475 million of first-rate centers with excellent NOI growth prospects. These newly acquired centers are 97% leased, with grocer sales that average more than $800 per square foot. And the demographics are much better with a total purchasing power that is 25% higher than those that were sold.","As a result, and as Brian will cover in detail, operating fundamentals remain strong as reflected by achieving nearly 95% occupancy and year-to-date same-property NOI growth of 4.5%. This positive momentum from robust demand for space and our high-quality assets, the limited amount of new supply and the beneficial impact of redevelopments should continue to drive occupancy and accelerate rent growth.","Not only has the recycling enhanced the portfolio, but together with other cost effective capital markets activity, it has also augmented a balance sheet that was already rock solid. Trailing debt to EBITDA is 5.9:1. And as of today, we have $100 million of cash and no outstanding balance on Regency's $800 million line of credit.","Development is an important core competency for Regency, and it's creating value in great new and redeveloped centers. The almost $300 million of developments that are in process, some of which haven't even yet broken ground, are 90% leased and expected to generate an incremental return on invested capital of approximately 9%.","Brian's going to spend some time describing our recently announced starts, and I know you will be equally impressed by the quality of these projects and the substantial value that's being created. Furthermore, the pipelines for compelling new developments, redevelopments and acquisitions are encouraging.","As you can tell, I'm gratified by the important portfolio development and balance sheet milestones that have been reached. As a result of high quality of the portfolio and the strength of the balance sheet, we are now in a position to pivot and place more emphasis on disciplined growth. Organic earnings growth, new investments, particularly developments, and the related conservative and opportunistic financing, will be the path forward for future portfolio and balance sheet enhancements. By 2015, growth in per share core funds from operations will no longer be constrained by the impact from the elevated priorities that were placed on deleveraging and the sale of nonstrategic assets and will more fully benefit from the higher level of development starts.","Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Hap. Good morning, everyone.","Core FFO per share for the third quarter was $0.65. This was $0.03 above the midpoint of our stated guidance range, primarily as a result of higher-than-expected net operating income from our 2012 acquisitions and in-process developments and also, lower G&A expense.","Our 2012 acquisitions are outpacing underwriting, and in-process developments are leasing up faster and rent is commencing sooner.","As Hap noted, the year-to-date same-property NOI growth was 4.5%. We now expect full year same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, in the range of 3.8% to 4%. With respect to transactions, dispositions continue to be an important source of capital to fund our development program. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of all the assets owned by our closed-end funds. And just after quarter and, we settled our preferred equity interest in the portfolio that we sold to Blackstone in 2012.","We have slightly increased the high end of our guidance range for dispositions. And because of the tremendous success we've had converting our development and redevelopment pipeline into real starts, we've tightened the range for development guidance. Also as you will hear from Brian later, due to the increased likelihood that we could close on a few more acquisitions by year end, we've raised the high end of our guidance for acquisitions to $215 million. Because of these results and updated expectations, core FFO is now projected to fall in the range of $2.60 to $2.63 per share.","The actions taken that have accelerated the enhancement of the portfolio and strengthening of the balance sheet, as Hap mentioned, will moderate our 2014 earnings growth rate. Early projections indicate that '14 will be a year similar to this year. But I also am proud that what we have accomplished has positioned us to enjoy better and stronger earnings growth in 2015 and beyond. We will discuss this in more detail on our upcoming guidance call on December 17.","Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone.","We're 3 quarters now into what is turning out to be a really strong 2013. Let me start by highlighting some of our operating results.","On a same-property basis, the operating portfolio is nearly 95% leased at the close of the quarter, and shop space occupancy stands at roughly 89%, the highest it's been since 2008 and a 130-basis-point improvement over 2012. With this increase in occupancy, aided by strong tenant demand and limited new supply, we continue to gain pricing power. Rent growth returned to double digits this quarter. Average rents for side-shop tenants continue to trend upward and are now 34% above the trough.","And not only are the starting rents improving, but we're also seeing more favorable lease terms as a whole, including better rent steps and more aggressive commencement dates. Retailers are acting on this positive sentiment. Many are making significant investments in their current spaces, as well as in new ones. Given the underlying strength of tenant demand, we see no slowdown in the positive momentum in all of the key operating metrics.","This heightened activity is evident, not only in the operating portfolio, but also in the strength of our development and redevelopment pipelines. Take our newest projects: Glen Gate, a development slated for start in October, will be 103,000-square-foot infill shopping center, built on the site of a former Avon cosmetics office building in an upscale neighborhood in Chicago. Some of you may remember touring this site at our Investor Day 2 years ago. The 3-mile trade area benefits from a population of 150,000 people, with average household incomes of $100,000.","Glen Gate will be anchored by Mariano's, a very successful grocery operator in the market, averaging sales of more than $50 million per store. The center is already nearly 90% leased and committed before vertical construction has begun.","We also just purchased a 4.5-acre site on which we plan to develop Shoppes on Riverside, a 50,000-square-foot center, anchored by the Fresh Market, that will serve the affluent waterfront communities located in close proximity to downtown Jacksonville.","Due to its location adjacent to the downtown core, the center will benefit from a daytime population of 110,000 people, which is fueled with strong demand from shop tenants, particularly restaurants.","Additionally, we started the redevelopment of Woodway Collection this quarter. Located in Houston, Woodway enjoys real strong purchasing power. Within 3 miles, there's a population of nearly 180,000 people, with average household incomes exceeding $100,000. The center has an excellent lineup of shop and pad tenants, including the country's second ever Carrabba's Italian Grill, which, to this day, is still owned and managed by the Carrabba family.","We recently completed a face lift on the side shops and demolished the former grocery-anchor space and will relocate a nearby Whole Foods to the center. This is a perfect example of what happens when you have superior real estate. Bad news, in this case, the loss of an anchor, becomes great news.","We've also seen remarkable leasing velocity in our in-process development portfolio. The 7 projects underway and soon to go under construction as of quarter end are nearly 90% leased, with a combined projected incremental return approaching 9%.","Grand Ridge Plaza in Seattle, which is a dynamic retail center of an upscale planned residential and commercial community, will actually be 99% leased when it opens. This is almost unheard of for a project of its size at 325,000 square feet. And the development starts since 2009 that are now complete and part of the operating portfolio are 97% leased.","Development is not easy, but the results are gratifying and the benefits are significant. This kind of performance is the result of the dogged determination and persistence of an experienced development team committed to its mission.","Turning to acquisitions. I am pleased that we continue to acquire premium shopping centers with outstanding NOI growth prospects.","Our most recent acquisition, Fellsway Plaza, closed earlier this month and is no exception. Fellsway represents a very unique opportunity to acquire institutional quality assets located in a densely populated and extremely supply-constrained close-in suburb of Boston. The property boasts purchasing power demographics with income-plus population of 435,000 in a trade area that enjoys 99% retail occupancy. Fellsway is 154,000-square-foot center, with the leading market share grocer generating $53 million in annual sales. The center is projected to deliver compounded annual NOI growth in excess of 6% over the next 10 years, driven by a redevelopment opportunity that we intend to start immediately. We expect the redeveloped center to demand base rents that are, on average, nearly 35% higher than current in-place rents. This combination of long-term stability and value-add potential is certainly an attractive acquisition in today's competitive marketplace. The team is working hard to find more opportunities with substantial growth and upside characteristics that mirror those of our more recent acquisitions.","And as Lisa discussed, because of 2 transactions that we have under contract, one in Raleigh and the other in the Northeast, we've increased our guidance for full year acquisitions.","Lastly, I'd like to touch on Safeway's recent announcement regarding their Dominick's chain and the decision to exit the Chicago market. We have 7 leases with Dominick's, one of which was previously subleased, with 6 properties that could be impacted. 4 of those properties are in joint ventures. The true impact of this is going to play out over the next quarter or 2, but we have been in proactive dialogue with other grocers about some of these centers for a while. With the pro rata weighted average base rent in single digits, we believe we should be able to attract desirable replacement tenants if we get these spaces back.","Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Lisa. This progress in placing the portfolio, balance sheet and development program on very high ground is a testament not only to our focused strategy, but also to the dedicated efforts of our talented team. Most important of all, we are committed to profit from our advantageous position by meaningfully growing NAV, shareholder value and future earnings.","We thank you for your time and welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Bilerman at Citi.","Katy McConnell","This is Katy McConnell on for Michael. Given occupancy almost reached the high end of guidance in third quarter, do you think the revised range is likely conservative for year end? And how much more upside do you think there could be in the next couple of years?","Lisa Palmer","I'll take the guidance part of the question, and then let Hap or Brian take the upside going forward. We do have a couple of strategic anchor move-outs that we're working on, which if they happen, could impact our occupancy by as much -- up to as much as 40 basis points, which would take us down to the low end of the range. Again, it may or may not happen. Obviously, that -- the impact on NOI is minimal because it's towards the latter part of the year, but the occupancy guidance is a point in time. So that's the range on the downside.","Brian M. Smith","In terms of outperforming, we have been outperforming so far this year. And with the beat raising [ph], I think the same kind of things could happen. One of the things that's going on that continues to be a favorable trend is the lower level of move-outs that we've been experiencing. And those move-outs that we are doing, many of those are done on a strategic basis where we have something better to replace them. Our shop move-outs for this quarter -- well, year-to-date, our shop move-outs are the lowest they've ever been, so I think that's probably one of the areas where you could see some improvement.","Martin E. Stein","Yes. During the next couple of years, as far as that part of your question, we do not see 90% occupancy on the shop space side, and 95% overall occupancy as being a glass or any other kind of ceiling and just would hope to see the next couple of years moving our occupancy above those levels.","Operator","We'll take our next question.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, going to the acquisition guidance, and thinking about that, how do you weigh the probability of coming in toward the bottom end versus the upper end of the guidance? And it sounds like if you don't come in at the upper end, is it transactions probably going to slip to 2014? Or it just kind of falls out and doesn't happen?","Brian M. Smith","At this stage, the project -- as Lisa mentioned, the projects are under contract, and we haven't seen anything in due diligence that would scare us, that would prevent a closing. They haven't happened, so there's always a chance. But for right now, we're feeling awfully optimistic that both of those will happen by year end.","Martin E. Stein","I think a bigger risk might be that one might get pushed into 2014. But...","Lisa Palmer","There is that assumption on -- so that could potentially push it, but I think we feel pretty good about it.","Martin E. Stein","We are really excited about both of them, so hopefully, we'll be able to share our thoughts on these with you in the not-too-distant future. [indiscernible]","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And we get a second question, right?","Martin E. Stein","Absolutely.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Looking at sequential leasing in the category, not the small shop, but 10,000 to 19,000 square feet. There is almost a 200 basis point sequential pickup. I was wondering if you can just kind of add a little color on what's going on there.","Brian M. Smith","Yes. We had a lot of leasing in that category. In fact, I think it's one of the strongest quarters we've ever had in terms of anchor leasing, maybe the second strongest quarter ever. So we're 99% leased in that category, and whenever we get an opportunity, they fill up pretty quickly.","A couple of those were major redevelopments. An example will be the Woodway Collection that we talked about in the prepared remarks where we replaced an anchor tenant that moved out last quarter with one this year, pulled through to this quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It's Rich Moore at RBC. On the franchise front, the tenants occupy a lot of the small shops, or could, I guess, theoretically occupy some more small shop space. What are you seeing from these national franchise guys? Is that -- and maybe not even franchise, just national small shop tenants. Is that picking up? Is that sort of leveling off? I mean, can you give us a feel for that?","Brian M. Smith","Rich, I have not seen any leveling off whatsoever. It's been strong, the quality of the franchisees has been very strong. Overall, I think small shops there -- I think there's no differentiation between franchisees and the others we're putting in there. They're healthy, very healthy, optimistic. I mentioned they're putting a lot of money back into the space. They're benefiting from the lack of new supply, and our pipelines right now are as full as they've ever been. They're the fullest they've been in 4 quarters. And if anything, we're experiencing more sense of urgency to get the stores open. So I think on all accounts, the small shops are looking good going forward.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And it seems like you guys are always finding another development to do. The talk is always or has been recently for the past, I'd say, 3 or 4 years that there isn't that much development to do and yet you guys seem to add one maybe every quarter. I mean, how would you characterize, I guess, the broader outlook for development at this point?","Brian M. Smith","I think-- I mean, obviously, numbers nationally would support that there's not much development going on, and we hear that same thing. Mostly what you see around the country would be retail and ground-floor residential, mixed use projects. We see a lot of redevelopment, but there hasn't been a lot of true shopping center development going on. We're seeing -- where we are seeing it would be places like Southern California, Houston, Washington, D.C. and North Carolina. But not a lot. And, I guess, I have to say I find this surprising, but at the same time not surprising. Surprising in the sense that we are finding that there's a lot of demand, as I mentioned the leasing is strong. Pipelines, I just mentioned are the fullest they've been in 4 quarters. The anchors, particularly the grocers, are expanding, and there's no supply. And if you're 99% leased in your large anchor spaces, they've got to find new locations. And that would be true of the other portfolios out there too. And development works, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you look at the past success of the ones that -- we started since 2009, it's almost $400 million, they're almost 93% leased and several of the projects haven't even gone vertical yet. So in that regard, I'm surprised. But I guess, where I'm not surprised is, as we've said all along, it's really difficult, especially if you're focused on the infill nature of the projects. The ones we've started since 2009 have combined purchasing power well over 200,000. And when you're playing in those infill markets, they're hard to find. They're fraught with all kinds of roadblocks, whether it be environmental -- challenges to the entitlements and so forth -- and so the only way really to get through that is not only to have a great team with a lot of experience, but to have them working on them for years. I think what's happening, or elsewhere around the country, is people are just starting up development programs, and it just takes years and years to get those things through the process. And as you know from some of the ones we've started recently, some of those -- most of those have been in the works for years.","Operator","We'll take our next question.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley. I have a question. I think Lisa, you said earlier that there's 2 assets under contract within that guidance of $150 million of acquisitions between now and year end. Curious if you could give some color on the size or any parameters around yield, IRR, around those contracts.","Martin E. Stein","One small portfolio and one's a single asset. As we indicated, one's in Raleigh, one's in the Northeast, both have exceptional growth, and the returns meet our parameters. And they're consistent with what the guidance we gave, and plus they got great NOI growth and one of them, we think, has even more upside even beyond that.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fair enough. And one more if I may. You made a couple of acquisitions recently with a JV partner. Just curious, were those assets that made sense to bring in a local partner? And how should we think about JV that's part of your acquisition strategy going forward?","Brian M. Smith","Well, the one that we closed in the fourth quarter, Fellsway, I think that's probably the poster child for the kind of property we want to do. We don't have a presence up there. It's obviously -- well, we don't have a development presence up there. It's extremely high barrier. It's a tough market to develop in. We know -- and this particular partner is very, very experienced. We've worked with him before. He has personally acquired or developed or redeveloped over 25 million square feet. One of the largest leasing companies in the Northeast, where they own, lease or manage over 70 centers and are the exclusive leasing agent for more than 11 million square feet on nearly 60 centers. And they also have a tenant representation arm, where they represent some of the largest, best retailers in New England. So we think, in this case, where we've got a redevelopment we're going to start right out of the ground, somebody who's from there, who went to school within almost a stone's throw is -- and with all the connections they've got on both development and leasing sides made great sense.","Martin E. Stein","And in that case, and probably in future cases, it's going to be access to the opportunity. And I think that's what the joint charter provided in this case. And any future opportunities like this where we have a joint venture partner is probably going to be involved.","Brian M. Smith","I mean, yes. To echo what Hap's talking about, in this particular case, there were several people competing for the project. And this guy, it looked like we were not going to get it. And he had been working with his broker friend on this for years and called him up and basically, I think, shook it free for us. So, yes, it really provided value there.","Operator","We'll take our next question.","Unknown Analyst","It's Jay [indiscernible] with Green Street. Just a follow-up on Rich Moore's question on development. I guess, you're obviously going -- being very thoughtful about the process. They're well-funded and preleasing is very good. So maybe from a company-specific standpoint, how do you think about critical mass in your development pipeline? And at what point are there too many balls in the air?","Martin E. Stein","I think the -- I think what we've said is we are very comfortable with the -- remember this year, 20 -- almost 30% of our development starts will be redevelopment starts. So somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% to 30% will be redevelopments. The development and redevelopment starts in the neighborhood of $150 million to $200 million-plus a year is something that we're very comfortable with. We think that's rightsized. We also think that the infill focus and\/or being in a planned community is -- and not being a merchant developer, developing that which we want to own long-term, that's a very focused strategy. And we're very -- and as Brian said, it has been extremely successful in the last 4 to 5 years. And that's where your focus is. And I think somewhere in that 200 - maybe a little bit higher, but averaging $200 million a year, is from a new development starts standpoint is -- would kind of be our goal.","Brian M. Smith","Let me just add to that. I mean, the focus here is not so much on size, but on quality. And -- what we have done in the past, where - we are not going to continue to staff up just because a new opportunity comes up. What we've done in the past and we'll continue to do is if there are more opportunities than a given team can handle, we'll either augment it from somewhere else where there's capacity, or we will just take the best opportunity of the ones available.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And then just to follow up on your kind of land bank, there hasn't been any movement there in the last couple of quarters. Should we be expecting an update there? Or where do those stand right now in the process?","Brian M. Smith","Yes. There has actually been a fair amount of movement on that one. We're down to a combination of land held for development and land held for sale. We're down to $61 million. A couple of years ago, we were at $150 million. And in the third quarter, you probably didn't see a lot of movement because we did sell a parcel out in Southern California, about $3.2 million. But that was offset by we moved a parcel of land that was going to be ground leased to Cinco Ranch into the land held for sale. So it reduced the net impact of the sales for the quarter, but that thing will be sold imminently.","Martin E. Stein","That's a significant focus, and as Brian indicated, we've made significant progress and expect that progress to continue into the fourth quarter.","Operator","We will move on to our next question.","Unknown Analyst","Luther Kreitz [ph] from Deutsche Bank here. Can you just give a little bit more color on the upside to acquisition guidance? That will be helpful. And I guess, as -- was there a particular circumstance that kind of accelerate the timeline there? And then just from a broader perspective on the acquisition front, given that some of the others are telling us, it's tough out there for buyers in certain pockets. Can you talk about the sourcing environment and the competition that you guys are seeing more longer-term in your acquisition prospects?","Brian M. Smith","Yes. In terms of, I guess, why the guidance went up is particularly the portfolio that Hap was talking about, it's been 3 months since we issued guidance, and a lot happened in that period. And this one is very recent, and it happened faster than the typical acquisition does. Normally, there's a long, drawn out process. In this particular case, we got in a plane, flew up there, and literally, the deal was closed that day. I'm sorry, the agreement was reached that day. So it is very competitive. Everybody's going after the same pool of great properties. And -- but fortunately, I know as of last quarter when we were counting this up, I think we looked back a couple of years. Of the 16 acquisitions we had done, 12 of them were done off-market. So that's what we try to do. We try to find things before they get competitive and really bid up. And we're having a fair amount of success at it, but it is very competitive. And there's a limited pool of the really good high-quality assets with good growth.","Martin E. Stein","And Lisa, you might just review briefly what our philosophy -- our policy is as related to acquisition guidelines going into the year.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. As you think about our -- just our business model, funding for our developments is coming from our dispositions. And to the extent that we either have access to cost-effective assets to the equity markets or are able to accelerate some of our disposition sales, and we can recycle those funds into great acquisition opportunities. So acquisitions are not part of our base model, if you will. And going into the year, the guidance was 0 to $50 million as we had really prefunded. And our dispositions were estimated at that time to be on the high end of $200 million, with development starts of $150 million. So, and as Brian said, we just didn't have any visibility to these 2 transactions the last time we reported.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Fair enough. And then just relative to the acquisitions that are kind of closing near- to intermediate term. I guess, should we think about those as more of a core property plug-and-play types? Or ones that might need a little additional attention capital-wise?","Martin E. Stein","They're going to be more core -- but I want to say that our -- we're not just investing capital. Unless it's in our view, it's got exceptional NOI and\/or upside. And I think all the acquisitions that we've done have those characteristics. It's consistent with our strategy. It's got a sustainable competitive advantage. It's going to be able to generate very nice NOI growth, in a lot of cases have additional upside. And otherwise, it doesn't make -- it's not a good use of capital.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question.","Brian M. Smith","While we're waiting, I was asked to clarify something -- Mike Mueller asked about -- asked a question, and I apparently misunderstood it. Mike, you were asking about the increase in the 10,000 to 20,000 square foot bucket and I was talking about the greater than 20,000 square foot bucket, so let me just modify that. Within the 10,000 to 20,000 where we saw such a big increase, it's a really small category that we've got, only 9% of our GLA, fits within the 10,000 to 20,000 square feet. And therefore, basically any leasing is going to move the needle. And we did 3 leases within that category and that's why we got the big jump. So sorry for misunderstanding that.","Operator","Caller, please go ahead.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jonathan Pong at Baird. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the disposition outlook. And I guess, you guys have made really great progress in terms of upping the disposition outlook so far this year. Can you talk maybe directionally as to where you see that volume trending for 2014? And how much more runway you actually have there in terms of just looking at your overall portfolio?","Martin E. Stein","As we indicated in our remarks, given the acceleration of our dispositions, the progress that we've made, we think that the portfolio is very well-situated right now. The balance sheet is very well-situated. And we're going to be -- it will be a funding source for developments going forward. And for -- potentially for other investments. And that's the way we're looking at it. And so we'll give you more guidance, but I think that, I guess, it's safe to say that our plans for dispositions in 2014 will be much -- and in the future will be at a much lower level, unless our investment activity is also larger than it's been the last several years.","Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And maybe on the small shop leasing trends, it does sound like there's a bit of an upside just there in terms of the overall industry, 10,000 square feet and below. Is there an opportunity to maybe be a little offensive and create some available space through downsizing or proactive lease terminations?","Brian M. Smith","Yes. First of all, I think there is a lot of upside just in leasing up what we've got. We are at 88.8% and see no reason why we can't get up to 92% or whatever. We are doing -- what you're really asking for is the kind of growth that's going to come from just aggressive asset management. And we're doing all the normal things whether -- the focus on rent growth, a focus on rent steps and occupancy. But some of the other things that fall in the category we talked about would be creating paths, creating additional GLA. And that does fall within our redevelopments. We've got example, this past quarter, how up at Speedway in Boston, we added a Chick-fil-A pad. We're adding a Panera pad at Culpepper. We're adding a Dick's at Culpepper and we're expanding some of our earlier development starts. We're taking and leasing creative space, which the market is allowing us to do now. For example, up at Speedway, we had a 100,000-square-foot store that we have Burlington Coat Factory in. They took the front 65,000 square feet. We leased the back 30,000 square feet, roughly, and that rent will actually triple in 3 years. So we're getting a good -- that's a good example of the rent increases we're getting. We are consolidating space or expanding it. We're upgrading the quality, different uses for space. For example, out of Plaza Hermosa in Southern California, there's a building that's not really part of the shopping center. It's located on a different tier. It's got plenty of parking. It will replace a nightclub with $1 billion hospital, 90-year-old company, and they're paying us almost 3% annual bumps. So -- and we talked about the strategic move-outs, much of our move-out activity now is the result of being able to replace tenants that are -- that we want to get out of there and replace with better people, better economics. And just kind of a couple of proactive things we're doing. Just to give you some examples, there's a national footwear chain that is in our Corvallis Center, and they had a right to terminate the lease, so they went ahead and they exercised it. And we instantly replaced them with a better tenant, another national tenant at much higher rent. And they came back and said, \"We were just negotiating.\" And so I think you're starting to see that kind of leverage showing up on the landlord side that we are going to fully take advantage of.","Martin E. Stein","And just to piggyback on that comment is, although we are doing a lot of creative things and proactive -- taking proactive actions to grow NOI and create value, at the same time, the kind -- and you always want to have less drop space than there is demand. But the kind of centers that we want to own are centers where there is substantial demand from the side-shop space, not only the anchor space. And where we're not afraid, but we're excited about the opportunities that the side-shop space presents.","Brian M. Smith","I think one of the other things that's going to fuel our growth going forward is not all of the markets out there have participated in this run-up and they're starting to show some good activity. I think perfect case in point is Florida, which has lagged, and all of a sudden the leasing activity is very strong there, and we're seeing real good rent growth numbers this past quarter.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time.","And I apologize, we do have somebody else queue up.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Tammy Fique, Wells Fargo. I just wanted to follow up, Lisa, on the lower G&A that you recorded during the quarter. I'm just wondering kind of what contributed to that and if that's the run rate going forward?","Lisa Palmer","Yes. It's a good run rate, and we were just able to realize some savings.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I think you may have touched on this, and maybe it's related to the move-outs, the strategic move-outs. But the occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 94.9%, and the 2013 guidance is 94.5% to 95%. You're already pretty close to the top end of that. Is there anything that we should be thinking about that wouldn't -- that would cause it to drop to the lower end of that range?","Lisa Palmer","I mean, it's really what I've already answered in terms of -- I mean, that takes up, that really accounts for the whole thing. And it's a matter of whether we actually accomplish what we're trying to accomplish before the year end. So again, they're proactive.","Brian M. Smith","They start at the low end of the occupancy -- yes, I mean, the only thing that could happen there, I think about halfway down to the bottom of the low end are a couple of large tenants we know are going to move out. So really, you're talking about, I mean, about 70,000 square feet, could something happen, if 1 anchor surprised us and moved out, that would get you there.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then with regard to the Blackstone preferred interest, was that an early termination? Or was that the amount that you expected?","Lisa Palmer","No. It was early. We had expected it to go through the end of the year, but we did receive the undistributed income for the remainder of the year. And I mean, I think they just basically wanted to settle prior to [indiscernible] IPO because some of those properties were included.","Martin E. Stein","We appreciate your interest, and we hope that you have a wonderful Halloween. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"18584":["Regency Centers (NASDAQ:REG) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  3, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Lisa Palmer","Martin E.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, Lisa Palmer. Please go ahead.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Bruce Johnson, CFO; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements.","Bruce? Sorry, Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. As Brian and Bruce will discuss in more detail, we made significant progress during the first quarter toward achieving our key objectives in all aspects of the business. Operating fundamentals are definitely trending positively. We ended the quarter at 93.6% leased. Same property net operating income was up by more than 4%. Move-outs and bad debts are at prerecession levels. Leasing demand remains robust, including small shop space, and we're starting to experience some pricing power.","While we're gratified by these results, it is still early in the year. We are keenly focused on building on this positive momentum, especially growing base rent and doing the heavy lifting needed to firmly re-establish Regency's long-term NOI growth rate at 3% or more.","We're gaining traction on the sale of targeted nonstrategic assets and the potential progress is encouraging.","Regarding recycling that capital into acquisitions, we're seeing some opportunities to buy dominant centers with excellent growth prospects in Regency's 2 dozen target markets. Given the intense amount of competition, buying great assets is one of the most challenging aspects of our plan.","In any event, as we've shared with you, we intend to be a net seller in 2012 in order to modestly reduce leverage and increase financial flexibility.","Our post-recession developments, redevelopments and expansions are performing well. As a matter of fact, in excess of our underwriting. We're on track to achieve returns in excess of 9.5% on the $200 million of incremental capital for the projects started after January 2009. As supported by our preferred stock transactions, almost $600 million of capacity on the line of credit and term loan and mortgage refinancings in our co-investment partnerships, we have the capability to take advantage of all facets of the capital markets spectrum. And we will continue to opportunistically improve upon a balance sheet that is already in solid shape.","Now I'll turn it over to you, Bruce.","Bruce M. Johnson","Thanks, Hap, and good morning to everyone. I think I speak for all of us here when I say that this quarter's results are encouraging. To recap, recurring FFO per share was $0.62. When you include the onetime charges associated with the preferred stock offering, offset slightly by gains on out parcel sales, total FFO per share is $0.55.","Same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, was positive 4.2%. There were 2 primary drivers. First, increased base rent from occupancy gains and contractual rent steps, contributed approximately 200 basis points; and second, increased net recoveries resulting from better occupancy and lower expenses contributed approximately 150 basis points.","It should be noted that a portion of the expense recovery was caused by timing differences, which could reverse in the second quarter when we complete our tenant reconciliation process, bringing the second quarter growth rate closer to 2%.","That being said, we are in fact raising guidance for the total year end results. We expect NOI growth to stabilize during the last half of the year, putting us in a 2% to 3.25% for the year. Additionally, our new percent lease guidance is 93.25% to 94.25% and recurring FFO per share guidance is $2.42 to $2.54.","It is also worth mentioning that we changed the fiscal year of our captive insurance company to end in April. As a result, this year we expect to recognize income from our captive in the second quarter rather than in the third quarter. As you may recall, this income is not included in same property NOI. We expect the income to be approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share and have incorporated this into our second quarter FFO guidance.","From a capital markets perspective, there are a couple transactions that I would like to highlight. In January, we drew $150 million of our available $250 million term loan. Proceeds were used to retire maturing unsecured bonds. The remaining $100 million is available at our option into July of this year. Then in February, as previously mentioned, we completed a preferred stock offering that resulted in gross proceeds of $250 million at an attractive 6 5\/8%. Proceeds from the offering were used to redeem an equal amount of outstanding preferred issuances. This redemption and new issuance will save nearly $2 million of preferred dividend payments per year.","Please note that we have increased the high end of the 2012 dispositions guidance. In part, this is due to a recent decision by our fund investors to commence marketing the entire portfolio for sale. You may recall that the fund was converted to a closed end vehicle in early 2011. And given current investment sales conditions, combined with the overall stability of the assets, now it appears to be a favorable time to exit.","With these transactions, we further strengthened our balance sheet evidenced by a well-laddered maturity profile and recent affirmations of our BBB credit rating.","Looking ahead, we will continue to opportunistically improve our balance sheet in a way that also enhances our financial ratios, which includes being a net seller of $50 million to $150 million, as indicated by our capital recycling guidance. Brian?","Brian M. Smith","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning. As Bruce pointed out, the steady improvements in operating fundamentals are finally translating into positive headline results. Our teams have been grinding it out since the recession began, and are working tirelessly to lease space and upgrade tenancy and it's starting to pay off, resulting in the kind of NOI growth that we expect.","Let me highlight some key operating results. In total, we signed almost 1.3 million square feet this quarter, of which roughly 1\/3 was new leases.","Move-outs, which usually peak in the first quarter of the year, remained lower than expected. Further, nearly half of these move-outs were planned or strategic.","For example, in a center in the D.C. market, we terminated Blockbuster and replaced them with PETCO Unleashed and Starbucks. This is the kind of upgrade in tenancy that we're after.","In terms of absorption, this is one of the best first quarters we've had, as the first quarter traditionally has a high level of move-outs following the holiday season. In fact, first quarter absorption for spaces less than 5,000 square feet was positive for the first time going back as far as we can calculate.","Operating percent leased increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to 93.6% and gains continued in almost all size ranges. Using the same pool of properties, same-store percent leased increased 10 basis points over the fourth quarter. In spaces less than 5,000 square feet, that gained nearly 300 basis points to 85.6% since first quarter 2011.","The strong leasing demand and better occupancy are paying dividends in 2 critical ways. The first is rent growth. As our centers and the markets around them lease up, we gain purchasing power. This is evident in both our rent growth, which was improved at positive 3%, and in our average shop rents, which have been increasing slowly since the end of 2009.","This rent growth is even more notable when we consider the fact that nearly half of the renewals were of leases signed at the peak of the market.","The second way that leasing demand and occupancy benefit us is by enabling the leasing teams to increase their focus on merchandising. Our strong pipeline is comprised of successful national, regional and unique local operators who enjoy strong followings and bring a special dynamic to our shopping centers. Working with these best-in-class retailers and restaurants is a mutually beneficial relationship in which their loyal customer bases further invigorate our centers, while our productive grocery anchors help drive additional traffic to their businesses.","This reinforces our viewpoint that side-shop space when appropriately sized to fit demand, is an asset rather than a liability, and represents an opportunity to create real value in base rent growth. And the local operators we are working with are well capitalized with access to capital for expansion.","The health of our existing tenants also continues to improve. Perhaps the best indicator of this is our AR balance, which is below pre-recession levels. Another telling indicator is tenant sales. Anecdotally, the feedback we're receiving from our property managers is that strong holiday sales have carried over into the first quarter, even in spite of high gas prices. This is true for anchors, as well as local retailers and restaurants.","Many of the grocery stores in our portfolio continue to experience positive sales growth. This top line growth has infused a palpable sense of optimism on the part of our tenants, who are now more confident about expanding into multiple locations.","Furthermore, as you know, a few big-box operators have recently announced store closings. None of these have affected our portfolio. We rigorously analyze our big-box space on an ongoing basis, and we feel really good about our exposure.","Let me now turn to development. We started 2 projects this quarter. The first, South Bay Village, in essence was income-producing land held we purchased 7 years ago. South Bay Village is located on true infill real estate in the Los Angeles area, with more than 240,000 people, earning average household incomes above $90,000 within 3 miles. We are replacing a dark Kmart with Orchard Supply Hardware, a Wal-Mart neighborhood market and HomeGoods.","It is adjacent to a highly traffic center anchored by Ross, Marshalls and Trader Joe's. This project is 100% leasing committed with an incremental return north of 13%.","We also started Cinco Ranch, which is located in Houston, Texas, within one of the country's most active, master-planned communities that has barriers-to-entry and an average household income of $120,000. The shopping center will be anchored by Kroger and Academy Sports. We have signed leases or LOI activity on nearly 80% of the shop square footage at rents averaging $2 a foot, above our underwriting. The projected ROI is approaching 9% with additional land available for future development.","Finally, I'd like to provide an update on capital recycling. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Lake Grove Commons, which is located on Long Island. We discussed this entry into New York on the prior call. We also sold 2 wholly-owned properties for $23 million at a combined cap rate of 7.4%.","Subsequent to quarter and, we sold 2 co-investment properties at a pro rata weighted average cap rate of 5.9%, generating $20 million of proceeds to Regency.","As we've stated in the past, we continue to pursue an expansion of our recycling program above and beyond our revised guidance. This could happen in the near future, but until there's more certainty, the modest impact to our FFO will not be included in guidance.","In summary, while a quarter certainly doesn't make a year, I am pleased with the first quarter results. We look forward to seeing what our team can do during the remainder of 2012. Hap?","Martin E. Stein","Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Bruce. Before I close, I'd like to take a moment and comment on Regency Centers' new brand. You may have noticed the new logo and brand identity when you opened the press release and supplemental. When I boil it down, the new brand is centered around Regency Centers' core beliefs that have been part of our DNA for 50 years, particularly 2 of Regency's key advantages.","First and foremost, our people. A talented team of professionals that is endeavoring to create value for our customers and investors. And secondly, and second, the portfolio of dominant shopping centers that are merchandised to our customers. High-performing grocery anchors and best-in-class local, regional and national retailers. I believe it is these advantages, along with our other core values, that will enable Regency to be a preeminent company and industry leader for the next 50 years.","In closing, while it is still early in the year and much still needs to be accomplished, it certainly feels like we are on track to meet our objective for 2012, and as important, position Regency to sustain profitable future growth.","We appreciate your time, and we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Quentin Velleley from Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of the same-store NOI number of 4.2% for the first quarter. Bruce, in your remarks, I think you said there was some timing differences on billings. Could you maybe just comment, if you stripped those out, what the same-store NOI number would have been?","Bruce M. Johnson","It's really hard to know until we know what happens in the second quarter. Maybe 10 to 15 basis points max, I think at this point. But until we see the full numbers, I'm not share we know exactly what would have -- the number would have been.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But it's only a small amount?","Bruce M. Johnson","Yes, a small amount.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just secondly...","Lisa Palmer","I'm sorry, Quentin, very quickly, let me add. The timing difference in terms of why the growth then may be much less or lower in the second quarter is the fact that more of our reconciliations had been completed. And so it's just the reconciliation timing difference is what's going from 4% to the 2%. It's over the comps of last year.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just the, last quarter, you moved almost $450 million of development completions into the operating pool. I think that was at about a 5% yield, stabilized yield of 6.6%, so there's some NOI upside there. How should we be thinking about that NOI upside? How have you been progressing with some of the leasing on those assets? And when do you expect the timing of that additional NOI to start coming through?","Brian M. Smith","I can talk to the progress, Quentin. If you look at the same properties that were in process of last quarter and compare them to this quarter, we gained 220 basis points. If you look at the same properties that were in process a year ago to now, it's up 570 basis points. So I think we are making really good progress. We expect that the ones for this year that are currently in process will get to 91% by the end of the year. So generally, by the time we sign leases on the development properties that have moved into the operating portfolio, you're talking really 3 to 6 months before that NOI starts coming in.","Lisa Palmer","And I think also if you'll recall back in December at our Investor Day, we did get that question, and we moved several to the same property pool that, to your point, Quentin, had a bit of upside left in it. And we estimate that it contributes approximately 25 basis points to same property NOI growth. And as Brian said, everything is on track.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, what's driving the decision to increase the capital recycling? And assuming it does happen, should we expect more of a -- just a pickup in dispositions? Or a pickup in dispositions and in acquisitions, as well?","Martin E. Stein","Our plan, in answer to your second question, our plan would be a net seller in the $50 million to $150 million range, so to the extent that we pick up or sell more dispositions than is in current guidance, we would try to increase the amount of properties that we're buying. So we're actively out there looking to find opportunities that meet our criteria, and in our 2 dozen markets and our great shopping centers with excellent growth prospects. I think we've mentioned in the past to the extent that we can effectively and efficiently accelerate and expand our disposition program in a way that makes sense, we would do that. And I think there's reasonable prospects that might occur.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But it sounds like it's going to be -- the plan would be to offset that with a complementary amount of acquisitions?","Martin E. Stein","Yes.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the second question, I'm not sure if you touched on this. If you did, I apologize. But I think, Brian, you mentioned small shop leasing was about 83% in the quarter. How did that compare to year end? And then what's your expectation for the balance of 2012?","Brian M. Smith","The small shop leasing was up across the board. I think I mentioned in the comments that it was up 50 basis points for the quarter and almost 300 basis points for the year. We had occupancy gains in all of the sectors. But the small shops, I think outperformed. I think the small shops in general, no matter what metric you look at, they're strong and they are better than last year. The tenants are experiencing sales increases across the board. As a result, we're hearing from our leasing people and property managers that they're more confident. They're expressing long-term optimism, which we hadn't heard before, and that there's now a sense of urgency. The move-outs are abating. We mentioned that in the comments that they're largely strategic, about 50% of the move-outs we're doing now is because we've got multiple retailers in line for spaces. We can terminate the weaker tenants and start moving them in. Rent growth is positive for small shop. So all in all, it's looking good.","Martin E. Stein","And I just want to clarify. I thought I heard that you might have said, maybe I misunderstood, that 83%, but we're over 85% in spaces under 5,000 feet.","Operator","Our next question today is from Samit Parikh from ISI Group.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I know that you said subsequent to quarter end, you had a couple of assets that you sold, cap rates in the 5s. And one of them was an asset, I believe, in San Pedro, which is a pretty good asset. I know it's in a JV. I'm just curious about your disposition strategy for this year, you're increasing it. Are you going to have a mix of sort of stronger quality assets along with some of your weaker ones to capitalize on maybe pricing today?","Martin E. Stein","Our primary focus is on selling nonstrategic assets. There were partnership reasons that made it make sense to sell the San Pedro asset. But it will be across the board, centers that we don't feel are strategic -- the -- or that are consistent with our strategy long-term, we're going to be trying to sell.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And you took down your cap rate assumptions for the dispositions. What does that tell us about sort of the demand for second-tier, the players coming into the market and sort of what IRRs they're looking for right now?","Brian M. Smith","I think I mentioned that we, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the sale of 2 properties, sub-6 or about 5.8%, 5.9% cap. So that was part of the reason. But I think there is a strengthening market. It has been strong and remains very strong for the institutional quality A properties. And there's always been demand for the Cs where there's lot of outside. Where we are seeing a change in this quarter is in the mid-tier, the kind of B-level properties, there's much more demand than there was in the past there. I think in those kind of properties, our buyers are looking for about 150-basis-point lift. So if they buy it at 9% cap, they want to get that down to 7.5% or so. But there is increased demand, and we did have those 2 sales which lowered the cap rates.","Lisa Palmer","And also, by adding the fund assets to the disposition plan, although they're not on the market yet, our hope would be that they would trade even below the range that we've disclosed. So that had a little bit of influence in bringing it down as well. They're pretty high-quality assets.","Operator","And moving on, we'll hear from Jeffrey Donnelly from Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The first question actually is about general market trends. Maybe you can just talk about some of your top cities, because I'm interested in knowing which are showing accelerating growth and absorption, or just beginning to maybe see some firming in concession and rents? And conversely, which ones maybe are proving stubborn or even going the other way on you?","Brian M. Smith","Hap mentioned our top 24 markets. And of those 24 markets, we had 15 of them that experienced same-store NOI growth greater than 4.5%, and we experienced 11 that had same-store NOI growth greater than 7%. And those would include markets like Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, Orange County, D.C., Atlanta, Dallas, Denver. So pretty much most of our top markets, we're experiencing that kind of growth. We had a couple markets in our top 24 that were -- did not perform that well. For example, Palm Beach, Portland and Raleigh. But in those cases, there was something going on. In the case of Palm Beach, we have a redevelopment where we took our Winn-Dixie anchored center, we terminated the lease with Winn-Dixie. So we've lost all the NOI, but we did that because we're moving Publix from across the street into a brand-new store. So that's going to be long-term very good news. And then in Portland, it was really driven by one large vacancy of Sports Authority, which we subsequently released to Best Buy.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Again, just as maybe a follow-up question, if I look at your lease expirations for 2012, '13 and '14, the rent that's expiring obviously has been above what you've been signing of late. But the year-over-year growth in that expiring rent seems like it's rising faster than the market rents have been rising. I guess I'm just wondering, do you think that the current rent spreads that you've been posting are going to be sustainable the next few quarters? I guess ultimately what I'm asking is what do you think about market rent growth going forward?","Brian M. Smith","Yes, the average rents that we got there, of course, include anchors, which may have long-term and you don't know if they're going to be actually rolling. When I looked at the average leases signed in the quarter, the shop space was about $25 and the anchor was about $11. If you take our historic 70-30 blend on that, that's about $21 a foot. And if you compare that to the expiring leases for this year, 2012, they're in the mid-$19 range. So I think overall, we're in pretty good shape. And again, if you look at, which I mentioned in the earlier comments, if you look at our rent growth, a significant amount of the leasing came from the 2007, late 2006, early 2008 era. And those rents were all positive. So the fact that we're getting through this period with positive rent growth and the fact that our average rents have been increasing and are now on a blended basis higher than our expiring, feel pretty good. You never know what's going to happen on an individual deal, which as we saw with the Kimco results, one deal can move the needle. But overall, feel pretty good.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On development, that's one element of your guidance that really didn't change, and yet you have started a couple of projects and you're getting good yields relative to kind of the sub-6 cap rates on acquisitions. And given the tightness that you're starting to see in more markets and open to buys that are out there. I mean is there a reason not to think you could kind of do at least the high end of your guidance? Or I mean, what's the development landscape that you're seeing right now?","Brian M. Smith","Well, 2 questions. Regarding the guidance, something can always knock these projects off, but I think we will be at the high end of the guidance for the developments. One of the large ones that we're working on just received its entitlement approval yesterday. So I think we will be there. Just in terms of the environment, there is more development starting to surface, more opportunities. I would say it's limited to the stronger markets, kind of the gateway markets and where there are legitimate projects with the kind of anchors and everything that we're looking for and the kind of markets, we are seeing increased competition from well-established private companies. It really comes down to the demand from the small shops and the rents that they can project. If you look at our property Northgate up in Oregon, our second phase that we have tremendous demand for more anchors than we can possibly accommodate. The problem is, we are not comfortable adding anymore, not very much more shop space there. And therefore, we're having trouble making it pencil. But in your gateway markets, we're definitely seeing more opportunities.","Martin E. Stein","And those markets are typically infill, and the time to get entitlements can be lengthy.","Operator","Next, we'll take a question from Nathan Isbee from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Brian, you pointed out again that move-outs were below budget. Can you just mention what your expectation was for the full year in '12? How much did you budget in 1Q and gross [ph] is where it ended up?","Brian M. Smith","We were about -- first quarter, I think we ended up about 110,000 square feet, fewer move-outs than what we had budgeted. Frankly, in going into the second quarter, in the first month, we're seeing about the same amount of reduced move-outs. So we go through this on a re-forecast process and go tenant by tenant. And whereas we think these things are going to have to move out, we're getting some positive surprises. So I don't know if that's just a delay or if in fact we are going to see fewer move-outs at the end of the year.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And your same-store NOI guidance change, was that included? Did you change your assumptions on move-outs?","Lisa Palmer","No, the range...","Martin E. Stein","Just the timing.","Lisa Palmer","Yes, just the timing. The range for move-outs that basically coincide with the 2% to 3.25%, is 1.4 million to 1.6 million square feet, and that's on 100% basis.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So to the extent you'd actually end up below that range, there would be further upside to NOI?","Martin E. Stein","But just as Brian has pointed out, the good and the bad, a meaningful portion of those projected move-outs are planned and strategic. I mean we're talking 50% to 60%. So they're known. So I'd be surprised if there was much...","Lisa Palmer","To the extent that we do better than that and to the extent that we hit our leasing objectives, yes. We need both.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. I'm sorry?","Lisa Palmer","We need both.","Martin E. Stein","Especially as it relates to the future.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then I guess then just focusing on the leasing volumes, they have been trending down the last few quarters. Is that a function of just taking a harder line on rents?","Brian M. Smith","Well, I might take a little exception there. If you look at the last few quarters, 2011, the last 3 quarters of leasing were the 3 highest we've ever had. So even though the fourth quarter was lower than second and third, it was still in the top 3 of anything we've ever signed. And then this quarter, it would look -- it is lower. It looks kind of like an average quarter when you go back historically. But again, the first quarter is the weakest quarter we always have in terms of move-outs, absorption and new -- or total leasing. And if you look at this quarter compared to prior first quarters, we're ahead in all those categories. We're way ahead in move-outs. We're way ahead in absorption and we're ahead in total leasing.","Operator","Craig Schmidt from Bank of America Merrill Lynch has our next question.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My understanding was heading into the quarter, I think the anchors were 99% leased and the small shop under 10,000 about 86%. If those are right, where do you think you can take the small shop space to by the end of the year? And what's the highest that small shop occupancy number has been in the company?","Martin E. Stein","91% is where the -- 91%, 92% is where it's been. And I think we've been pretty straightforward that our objective is 90% in order to get to 95%. And I think that we're going to make progress -- we're making progress -- I would -- it might -- I don't think we'll get there by the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the acquisition side. I know class A shopping centers, you're now kind of seeing these kind of sub-6 cap rates. But I'm just curious, what exactly you have to underwrite in order to kind of make those deals pencil out? And specifically, what kind of IRRs you're also expecting on those type of deals?","Martin E. Stein","For something to have -- pay less than a 6% cap rate, it better have a very nice growth profile. And that's the key thing, it's what's the total return of going into it plus growth.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And the growth profile you are underwriting is what, 4%, 5%?","Martin E. Stein","It's hard to find, unless you got a redevelopment, a lot of shopping centers with that kind of growth profile. We're looking for growth rates that are going to average in the 2.5% to 3% range, under very vigorous underwriting.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just in regards to the asset sales, and you guys bumping up your projections. Are you still kind of looking roughly at about the same type of cap rates for those deals? Or have they even come in better now as evidenced by some of the deals you did this quarter?","Martin E. Stein","I think we revised the range for the cap rates on what we expect to sell downward.","Operator","We'll go next to James Sullivan from Cowen and Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Given the strength and demand and pricing in the leasing that you've shown here in the first quarter and that's really been underway for a couple of quarters, and given the -- I think the word urgency was used in some of the negotiations with some of the prospective tenants. Just trying to get a handle on how soon and how strong a recovery in development starts can be. And I know, Brian, I think you touched on this earlier when you talked about, obviously, the yields on some of the most recent starts and some of the problems with other projects that may not pencil out. And I guess the question I'm trying to get to is that we've been hearing now for a while that retailers have open to buy, they need locations and yet there's not a lot of development taking place. And they've been unwilling to commit to the rental levels that will make the developments work. But your comments earlier suggested that it's really kind of a small shop issue that's holding back and preventing projects from penciling out. So I guess my question is -- it's really 2-part. Number one, when you think about your kind of 3- to 5-year plan, what kind of an annual development starts number would you -- do you have in mind? Number one. And number two, how close are we to the point where you can really start ramping that up and getting the small shop pricing and demand in place to have that happen?","Brian M. Smith","Yes, Jim, the example I gave was kind of unique to Medford because that's the market where we aren't comfortable putting in a lot more small shops. But I would say, as we move -- as we look for developments in more of the urban, kind of gateway markets, we don't have that same kind of problem with the small shops. I think when you start developing -- as we do developments in those markets, you're probably going to see a lot more competition, and you're going to see returns are a little bit lower. But in terms a of 3- to 5-year plan, we are looking for -- we're staffed to do anywhere between $150 million to $200 million a year. And if I look at our pipeline, you know what the guidance is right now. I think we're going to get the high end of that. And we have projects in the works for next year that would take us potentially a lot higher than that. In terms of how close we are to really seeing it ramp up, I think we are starting to see it. As I mentioned, we're starting to see more competition. We're not seeing it from your new, small, undercapitalized developers. You are seeing it from the guys who've been, who are private, who've been around a long time. On the East Coast, it's Eton, it's JBG. On the West Coast, it's the Irvine Company. Those kind of companies. And they're aggressively competing with us right now for the best projects.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And is it your feeling that the anchor retailers have accepted the numbers that you guys need in order to have these projects pencil out now?","Brian M. Smith","I think the anchors are, especially for the kind of locations we're talking about. For example, Dick's. Dick's has historically been a second-generation space user and we're doing multiple projects with them with brand-new developments. So I think that's an example of where, to your point, Jim, they can't get the stores, they got the open to buys and they are going with new developments and paying the rent they need to.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Brian, you were talking about regaining a little bit of pricing power in the market, in the small shop market as well. When you look out over the next 2 years and you think about further increase in pricing power, do you think you're going to primarily see it in the headline rents? Or do you think you'll be able to also reduce some of the CapEx packages you provide to tenants?","Brian M. Smith","I think it's in the headline rents. I don't think that our cap -- our white boxes and our TIs are out of whack. We look at that every quarter. And while our total TIs are up, although I think they're down this quarter, it's because of the increase in leasing. But if you look at it on a per square foot basis for just the tenants that we're giving TI packages to, it's very consistent. In fact, we've been in a several quarter downtrend on it to the point where I was wondering if we were being a little bit stingy. But historically, we're right in line. So I don't think you're going to see packages coming down materially.","Martin E. Stein","And rates are moving, it's just they aren't back to where they were at the peak.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Sure. And in terms of the gap between lease space and occupied space, what's that gap as of the end of the first quarter?","Brian M. Smith","It's 220 basis points. So we've got -- I think it was -- yes, it was 220 basis points. So I think 170 of that is tenants that haven't moved in this space and 50 of it is tenants who have moved in and are waiting to pay rent. They're doing their build-out and everything and it will soon start.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On the development front again is -- are you seeing more opportunities for land you already have, which is, I guess, basically what South Bay Village is, versus brand-new opportunities where you're going out and tying up the land and then I guess having to compete more with other developers?","Brian M. Smith","A little bit of both. We are making good progress in our land held. I think since first quarter of 2011, we've gotten rid of 128, put it either sold or put in production, 120 acres. As I look at our pipeline for the rest of this year and even for next year, it is mostly new properties.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Brian, where is that, South Bay Village, just out of curiosity, exactly?","Brian M. Smith","It's in Torrance.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It's in Torrance, so...","Brian M. Smith","Yes. So it's south of the airport, west of the 405 freeway.","Operator","And Vince Chao from Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry to kill the development questions here. But just in terms of the competitive landscape, the well-capitalized guys are the ones you're competing against. But just wondering if you're seeing any change at all in the financing for maybe some other guys in the market? Is there any increase in financing for construction?","Brian M. Smith","We are hearing that there is. I don't know the terms. But I definitely know that a lot of the smaller developers who have been out the game for the last few years, depending on the property, depending on what's behind their guarantees and all, can get financing.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And is that something that's just kind of happened over the last, say, 3, 4 months? Or has it been in progress for longer?","Brian M. Smith","I'd say there's been a noticeable pickup in the last 6 months.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- sorry, if I missed this from earlier. But on the term loan, is there anything that would cause you not to draw down the remaining amount or is it tied to sort of your investment activities in any way?","Bruce M. Johnson","You're exactly right. It would be tied to our investment activities.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But if the opportunities don't materialize by the time you have to draw it down, you would take the money though? Or...","Bruce M. Johnson","No, we would not.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. We potentially, for our banks that are on the line, we have already discussed this with them. We could potentially extend the delayed draw feature.","Bruce M. Johnson","In case there were some timing differences, we expect it.","Lisa Palmer","Yes. As we have more visibility to -- for the rest of the year for the execution of the capital recycling as, I believe, Brian or Hap mentioned, we would expect, given our guidance, to be a net seller of somewhere between $50 million to $150 million. If we're in that range, then it's likely that we would draw down the term loan at some point before the end of the year. If dispositions gets much further ahead of acquisitions, then we would not.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a question on -- back to the small shop tenants and your comment that they're looking better. What do you think is driving that? Are they getting better access to credit? Or are they feeling more confident and thus are more willing to dip into their own cash reserves? And also, how would their health vary across your markets?","Brian M. Smith","Well, a couple of things there. So we're talking how are they doing and how are they feeling versus financing. I'll start with the financing. We said for some time, and it remains true, that our leasing is not to anybody that is putting financing contingencies on there. They are well capitalized. We're hearing there's plenty of private equity out there for them. So all these tenants that we're dealing with are well capitalized. In terms of why they're doing better, why they're more optimistic, it really comes down, I think, to several things. First of all, we have been, over a 3-year period, consistently moving out our weaker players and putting in strong operators. So I think you have a higher-quality tenant across the board. Second of all, there's less competition out there. Third, you are seeing much better sales. And I think it's the sales, more than anything, and the margins, that are making these guys bullish. They've been able to -- we heard over the last 6 months, they're actually able to start raising prices now. So it's really the fundamentals of their business, the fact that these are the tested operators and that there's just not that much competition. And finally, there's not any -- there's very little new growth out there. So it's not like they're having new competitors pop up all around them.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just to characterize their health across your markets, is it pretty consistent? Or is there a big variance, is one market weaker than another?","Brian M. Smith","The way we look at it is, on a portfolio basis, we measure not only AR is greater than 90 days as a percent of revenue, and that has really fallen, continues to fall. It's now below 0.4%, whereas before it was up around 0.5% -- I mean, it was about 1.5% at one point, wasn't it? So we're seeing it across the board. We also measure just people who are delinquent in various different categories, those have all been declining. Certainly, if you go to different markets, you're going to find that not to be the case. We're going to find more stress in markets like Arizona and Phoenix. Whereas if you go to Houston, we had 0 move-outs last year -- I mean, sorry, last quarter. So I think we can generalize that they're healthy all the way across the board. But it's going to depend on individual tenants and in individual markets.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions today. Speakers, I'll turn the conference back over to you.","Martin E. Stein","We appreciate your time and wish everybody to have a great rest of the week and great weekend. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that does concludes our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laura Clark. Thank you. You may begin.","Laura Clark","Good morning and welcome to Regency\u2019s first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.","Before we begin, I would like to address forward-looking statements that maybe discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","On today\u2019s call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplements, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at regencycenters.com. Lastly, we request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call to allow everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am very pleased with our first quarter results and with the completion of our merger with Equity One. The team has made extraordinary progress integrating the companies. The combined portfolio is demonstrating its exceptional quality with another quarter of being 96% leased and producing over 3.5% same property NOI growth. Our developments and redevelopments continued to perform well. Substantial synergies are already being realized. These collective achievements are reflected in our increased earnings guidance.","I cannot overstate our team\u2019s excitement and enthusiasm with the merger and further enhancement to our four strategic pillars. One, we own an unequalled portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. Two, we have an industry leading development platform. Three, our business activity is supported by a fortress balance sheet. And four, we benefit from a special culture in a deep team of talented professionals. This compelling combination will grow cash flow and earnings, which in turn grow NAV, dividends and shareholder returns.","Now, I would like to provide some perspective to the current challenging environment for many retailers and the negative headlines that have become part of our daily reading. Although we will certainly not be immune, there are compelling reasons why I feel that the sky is not falling and why I remain optimistic that well-conceived, well-located and well-merchandised retail real estate will succeed in this environment and Regency\u2019s outlook remains extremely bright.","During the 4 years I have been in the business, competition, retail bankruptcies and store closures have been integral parts of the landscape. We fully understand and appreciate that technology, particularly online shopping and an overabundance of space are combining with other factors to accelerate store rationalization. As a result, a number of lower quality centers will be losers, centers which will either struggle or not even survive. However at the same time, it is important to keep in mind that winning retailers who excel at being relevant to their customers are continuing to expand at a notable pace as they will need bricks and mortar space to service and sell to their customers.","Regency\u2019s portfolio is a balance of shopping centers, where the winners will thrive, centers that are convenient to the neighborhoods and communities with substantial purchasing power and supply constraints and are well-merchandised to other highly productive winning retailers. The vast majority of our threat comes from best-in-class, local, regional and national tenants that offer a durable combination of convenience, necessity, service, value and better shopping experiences. When disruption causes retailers in our portfolio to rationalize their store count, we have often found that our locations are must-keep or if the user vacates, bad news is typically good news as we are able to attract a better user at higher rents.","Finally, our experienced team has a proven track record of navigating major disruptions in the cyclical and secular changes in our business. We employ those lessons learned in a rigorous and proactive approach to capital allocation, recycling and asset manager. These factors have all served to reinforce our conviction that Regency\u2019s portfolio has never been better positioned to withstand the challenges and prosper from the opportunities that we encounter in the shopping center business. And there is no better evidence that Regency owns the winning shopping centers that have minimal exposure to recent bankruptcy as well as our substantial releasing success for those sites that did experience store closings.","Before I turn the call over to Mac, I would like to acknowledge his added responsibilities for transactions, along with development as EVP of Investments. I will now turn the call over to Mac.","Mac Chandler","Thank you, Hap and good morning. I am pleased to share our enthusiasm for the developments and redevelopments we have in process. They now reflect a total investment of over $500 million, including the additional projects acquired through the merger, which our team had successfully transitioned. Our in-process development and redevelopments are expected to generate returns of 79%, representing significant value creation. Regency\u2019s proven development platform has delivered over $1.5 billion in development projects since 2009, at an average 8% return. Our industry leading development team continues to source compelling opportunities as evidenced by our two latest development starts and we are excited about the opportunities acquired through the merger.","During the first quarter, we started two ground-up developments, representing a total investment of approximately $60 million. The Field at Commonwealth is a Wegmans anchored 190,000 square foot center located in Metro DC. Commonwealth will benefit from an affluent trade area with strong demographics, including household incomes averaging $140,000 as well as strong daytime population. Though construction has only just begun, the project is already 82% leased and committed. We anticipate project completion at mid-2018 at 7.5% stabilized yield.","Our second development start, Pinecrest Place, is located within a premier infill submarket of Miami, with significant barriers to entry. The 70,000 square foot center will be anchored by a Whole Foods that is relocating from a nearby center and shadow anchored by Target. Similar to Wegmans, we continue to value the quality Whole Foods brings to a shopping center through high levels of food traffic and sales volumes, which attracts the best restaurants and side-shop retailers. Pinecrest is expected to stabilize in mid-2018 at a 7.3% return. Please note that we increased our guidance for the year and now anticipate starting between $175 million and $275 million of development and redevelopment projects. While the best development opportunities are limited and competitive, Regency is well-positioned to capture more than our fair share of future projects given our platform depth, enduring tenant relationships and demonstrated track record paired with our well-capitalized and flexible balance sheet.","Turning to acquisitions and dispositions, we continue to control the Northeast acquisition opportunity we mentioned in our previous call, which we now hope to close in the second half of the year. In regards to dispositions, we have revised our guidance to $100 million to $200 million commensurate with Regency\u2019s increased development and redevelopment spend. Importantly, our disposition strategy remains the same as we will continue to sell properties as needed to enhance portfolio quality while also funding new investments whether those are developments or redevelopments at attractive returns or acquisitions of premier shopping centers with strong NOI growth profiles.","I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa.","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line. Our first quarter results were highlighted by combined same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, driven almost entirely by base rent growth. It is important to note we are presenting same-property NOI growth on a pro forma basis. The metrics are calculated as if all properties were owned and made the definition of same-property for the full calendar year.","We remain highly leased. The combined same-property portfolio is 96% leased with shop space at almost 92%. Taking into account the combination of the two portfolios, there is essentially no sequential change in the percent lease of the same-property portfolio. And in fact, small shop occupancy is up 70 basis points year-over-year. Overall, leasing spreads for the quarter were 8.2% with shop space leasing spread showing continued strength at over 9%. Rent spreads on new leases, in what was a relatively small sample size this quarter, were substantially impacted by one anchor lease in the center that is targeted for sale. Without this one lease, new rent spreads were over 10%. The bottom line is that we continue to see healthy demand when leases expire and we also continue to have success despite the decreasing amount of remaining space left to lease and that decreasing amount is often some of our most challenging spaces. It is also important to note, as Hap alluded to earlier, that 95% of closures from bankruptcies that occurred last year have been re-leased or are in final lease negotiations.","Our merger with Equity One closed on March 1 and our team has been focused on a successful integration allowing us to proceed towards our primary objectives of the merger; one, achievement of enhanced same-property NOI growth, two, execution of a larger development and redevelopment program and three, realization of synergies. All of these lead to accretive core FFO results. I am very pleased to report we have made tremendous progress towards achieving each of these objectives and as Hap mentioned, reflected by our revised guidance ranges. The integration of the two platforms has gone very smoothly. We have clear visibility to achieving the $27 million of operational and overhead synergies that we projected.","Now I would like to discuss our revised guidance in more detail. We have provided a full update to our guidance that reflects the merged company. Updated core FFO is expected to be $3.60 to $3.68 and NAREIT FFO of $3 to $3.10. NAREIT FFO includes the impacts of the one-time merger transaction costs estimated to be approximately $80 million in 2017 or $0.50 per share. You may recall when we announced the merger, we did communicate that we expected the merger to be accretive to core FFO before the incremental impacts of non-cash purchase accounting adjustments. In our supplemental, on Page 39, we have provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact to core FFO from these non-cash items. It can be a bit complicated, but I will do my best to summarize for you now.","Our pre-merger standalone 2017 core FFO guidance midpoint was $3.47 per share. Our revised post-merger midpoint is $3.64. If you exclude the incremental non-cash impacts, adjusted core FFO at the midpoint is $3.53 per share. That represents a $0.06 to $0.07 per share increase of which the majority has resulted from accretion related to the merger. We also increased our same-property NOI growth guidance to a new range of 3.2% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by our strong first quarter out-performance. I would like to remind you that upon closing, we did increase same property growth guidance by approximately 80 basis points, simply as a result of the expected growth in the Equity One portfolio. Before closing, I do want to call to your attention that next quarter same-property NOI growth could fall below the low end of our range due to the timing of our CAM reconciliations. This is only a timing difference and does not impact full year expectations.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Just on redevelopment, how are you thinking about some of the bigger, more complex redevelopment and densification projects that had been in Equity One shadow pipeline, sort of in the context of the current environment and maybe if you talk about sort of your approach to sort of development investment in general as you look forward to 2018?","Mac Chandler","Sure. Christy, this is Mac, I would be happy to answer that. I guess the first thing I would say is these Equity One properties, the ones that are sort of the typical ones for redevelopment are all tremendous properties. Very well located, in the best markets, so we are very excited just about the locational attributes. We will take a step back, that\u2019s what our teams are doing now and we are looking at them. The redevelopments could be a straightforward retail redevelopment in which case there is great NOI growth profiles going forward. We are also looking at more complex retail redevelopments and then also mixed use formats. So we haven\u2019t done any of these large projects to determine our path yet, we are still in \u2013 considering these various alternatives, but we are going to take a hard look at those in light of the fact that several of these projects take 2 years, 3 years \u2013 they take a few years down the road, actually to get entitlements in hand, even though they have great underlying entitlements. So we will look at them just like we have for decades here in our development program. We will look at risks, reward, timing of all that. If we do bring in a non-retail use, we would typically go out and seek the best in class non0retail partners, such as a multifamily developer and we have great relationships with the very best players \u2013 partners, who are well capitalized and experienced.","Christy McElroy","But there has been no change in sort of your overall approach to development in the current environment?","Mac Chandler","There hasn\u2019t \u2013 no, I mean we are conservative by nature and we are diligent as we look at these projects and we don\u2019t see any change to that. So as projects get closer to being realized, we will look at the current environment at such time, but many of these Equity One projects will take shape in the months and years to come as they flush themselves out of the entitlements.","Hap Stein","And the ground-up developments that we are looking at basically are very consistent with Regency\u2019s strategy, strong anchors, strong demographics and many of them are going to be delivered 2 years and 3 years out. But we also not only have strong anchor sponsorship, but we also have a good inclination \u2013 indication from the side shop retailers how the project is going to be well received. It\u2019s not specular development and it involves, Mac alluded to, the same and even more \u2013 maybe even a little bit more of a rigorous approach today.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just my second question, in the past part of your capital raising strategy have included equity issuance to fund or help fund incremental acquisitions, how are you thinking about your cost of capital today from a funding standpoint given what\u2019s happened in the equity markets, especially, if you think about sort of funding this potential deal in the Northeast that you are working on, how does \u2013 and how does that impact your willingness to do deals?","Lisa Palmer","Christy, I will take that. Again, similar to what Mac said about developments, we haven\u2019t changed how we think about, basically sources for our investment opportunities. If you think about how we provide guidance on our business model, it\u2019s not dependent on acquisitions. We do have one that is under our control\/under contract in the Northeast, which has been for a while. I will remind you that we have the forward equity that we priced last March, a very nice attractive price of close to $80 a share that we can draw down to fund that acquisition. And then going forward, again nothing has changed, same strategy we have always had. We will access the equity markets when it\u2019s priced attractively. And I think we typically will say it\u2019s not our job to tell you what\u2019s NAV, but I know right now that we are trading at a discount to NAV. I think that\u2019s pretty obvious. So I would not say that our equity is attractively priced today. So today, we wouldn\u2019t be accessing that market. So we would be sourcing from dispositions to the extent; one, to fund our development spend, which is what our guidance incorporates and we do have an acquisitions team and we find it a very compelling investment opportunity which has attractive and future NOI growth profile that is accretive to what we have, so quality accretive, growth accretive. We could potentially increase our dispose to match fund that.","Mac Chandler","But the key point is we do not need to access the equity markets to continue to invest particularly in new developments and redevelopments or to extend any acquisition between free cash flow\u2026","Lisa Palmer","I neglected to mention free cash flow. So free cash flow this year will be approximately $150 million and that is growing at a pretty good pace in future years.","Christy McElroy","Got it. Thanks for the time guys.","Mac Chandler","Thanks Christy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.","Greg McGinniss","Hi, good morning. This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. 2017 synergies appear to be kind of accelerated from prior guidance, it looks like you are actually achieving $27 million of actual savings versus run rate savings, just wondering how you are able to achieve this goal so quickly?","Lisa Palmer","Actually, it was interesting as we still have some open positions. So as part of the merger, we had to add 65 positions to Regency and we have not filled all of those positions. So our updated guidance does, at the midpoint, we have increased G&A approximately $1 million. And the fact of the matter is, is that on day 1, a substantial amount of the G&A went away. And as we go through the year, we fill those positions we are going to get closer to what will be the run-rate.","Greg McGinniss","And then is there any expectation, I mean, you guys have \u2013 I know you only had couple of months to be looking at this merger, but is there any expectation for more savings potentially?","Lisa Palmer","We had pretty rigorous analysis when we actually evaluated the merger and feel really comfortable with the $27 million of synergies. And then going forward, we will see the company grow as it typically would.","Greg McGinniss","Great. Thank you.","Hap Stein","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning everyone. Just sticking with the integration and synergies as part of the discussion, do you still anticipate sort of the full run-rate to be in place by the end of the year or do you think that can be sooner?","Lisa Palmer","I think that with our guidance, you will see that we have really already achieved the substantial majority of that $27 million. So, it\u2019s in place and 2018 will be a typical run-rate for Regency.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And then on the integration, you mentioned that was going quite smoothly. I guess, at this point, what\u2019s left either from a back office perspective, you mentioned still needing to hire a few more bodies. I am just curious what\u2019s left in terms of the integration? And then was there any issues in terms of involuntary turnover or anything like that as a result of the two companies coming together?","Lisa Palmer","I will answer the last question first. We really \u2013 we are really pleased with the retention of the people that brought \u2013 we brought with us from Equity One. Equity One had a great culture and I think that their employees and their team members could see that they were joining a team that also had a great culture. So, hats off to David and Matt and Mike for that and that\u2019s gone extremely smoothly. In fact, we have most of them in the office here today for an event. And in terms of the \u2013 what\u2019s left to do, most of it is back office. Again, we do have some hiring to do in the field, but very little because we brought \u2013 of the 65 positions, approximately 40 of those were in the field\/supporting the field and those people we did bring over from Equity One. The new positions that we had to hire were back office accounting, because we are centrally located here in Jacksonville and their accounting department was in Miami and New York. Offered relocation, we just didn\u2019t have many takers. I can\u2019t imagine why Jacksonville is a wonderful place to live. And \u2013 but what\u2019s left is mostly back office. The purchase accounting is really complicated. It involves third-parties. I think, as most of you know, we received our third-party inputs, if you will, after the April 1. So, it\u2019s been a really short timeline and right now, we are still working on it. So, our Q will have provisional purchase accounting. I think we mentioned that in our \u2013 you will see that when you read the Q. So that\u2019s what\u2019s left to do. And again, it\u2019s complicated. The team has done tremendously well and really sprinting to get everything finished and integrated and we are really excited about the future of this company.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And just one last question for me on the same-store NOI guide that was increased a little bit from the prior fairly unique versus what a lot of your peers are saying and obviously, you have got the quality portfolio to support that. But I am just curious, what\u2019s being embedded in the future outlook in terms of bankruptcies that we may not have heard about yet or store closures? Just curious if that\u2019s changed at all since your prior guidance.","Lisa Palmer","We have incorporated obviously tenant fallout\/bankruptcies, future bankruptcies into our guidance. We \u2013 in the first half of this year, we are obviously feeling the effects of the \u201816 \u2013 the \u201816 bankruptcies. So, the first quarter, in fact, the impact from bankruptcies was 70 basis points. As we get towards the end of the year, we are going to actually \u2013 those leases that we talked about \u2013 that I talked about, being 95% released, those will begin to rent commence in the latter half of the year. So, that will help our same-property and then at the same time, we are expecting that we may have some fallout. So incorporated in our guidance is about 25 to 50 basis points of total impact from bankruptcies, flat more or less from the \u201816 and then additional for this year.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","Hey, good everyone. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on, on the small shop? I mean what are the local tenants doing? We hear everyday about all the national retailers that are struggling on the big box side, but just curious if it\u2019s the exact opposite going on with the small shop tenant with the occupancy picking up nicely year-over-year?","Jim Thompson","Wes, yes, I\u2019ll answer that question. It\u2019s Jim. As we look at our key health metrics for our side shop folks, accounts receivable, bad debt, move-outs, those metrics all remain at relatively low levels, but we are obviously closely monitoring those. Our leasing pipelines continue to remain solid. We are seeing best retailers are making more disciplined leasing decisions, which I think \u2013 we think is very good, but it\u2019s also quality, not quantity kind of attitude today. So overall, I think the side-shop program today is consistent to what we have seen in the past.","Hap Stein","Yes, being 92% leased is a historically high level it\u2019s not the highest we have ever been at, but it\u2019s historically high level and I think it is \u2013 it reinforces, as you indicated, the quality of the portfolio.","Mac Chandler","The only thing I would add is and Lisa touched on it, I think the production folks that came over from Equity had shared a very, very similar vision to us and both teams have done an excellent job over the last several years on the side-shop leasing.","Hap Stein","Not only leasing the space up, but upgrading the quality of the tenants. In Regency\u2019s case, this is our fresh look initiative and approach.","Lisa Palmer","I feel like I have to take this opportunity to reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks, the fact that on a combined portfolio basis, our shops year-over-year, up 70 basis points is pretty impressive and hats off to the team.","Hap Stein","Yes, we are not taking anything for granted.","Wes Golladay","Okay, yes. And then going back to the bifurcation of the winning centers versus the losing centers, are you already starting to pull meaningful more amount of tenants from the adjacent centers or is it just all people just looking new retailers getting into the market?","Hap Stein","We are primarily expanding retailers, because we have already \u2013 for the most part, already attracted a lot of the better retailers, not that we aren\u2019t able to take retailers from other shopping centers, but Jim, I would say, it\u2019s primarily retailers opening up additional stores in the market or going into them.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi. Looking at the current development, redevelopment pipeline, it\u2019s about $500 million, 50:50 split between new and redevelopment. If you are looking out over the next say, 3 to 5 years, do you think you will roughly have that same sort of split?","Mac Chandler","Yes, it\u2019s a little early to say that, but what I will say is what you like about Equity One \u2013 one of the things we really like are some of these tremendous embedded opportunities within the portfolio. So a good chance that, that could be the case. In many of the specific opportunities, the range of how extensive of a redevelopment you could do varies and that will depend on market conditions, but I would not be surprised if it moves that direction and our teams are setup to take advantage of that. That\u2019s one of the great things about our platform is our development teams are also the redevelopment teams and we are in the field and we are prepared to take those out. So, we certainly would be disappointed if that was the case. We would be equally as pleased.","Hap Stein","Yes. And from a cycle standpoint, I think adding this, as Mac alluded to, having the redevelopments come on, we may see a downturn in ground-up development opportunities and having these redevelopment opportunities will be a great fit for our development program.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay. And then I guess on Serramonte, I mean how are you dealing that, is that a long-term hold for Regency or at least in the current form or it\u2019s fully owned?","Hap Stein","I will be saying this is, is that obviously, given its size, scope and nature during our underwriting and since closing, Serramonte has garnered a tremendous amount of attention from our market teams and from our top management teams, so let me start off with that. Secondly, let me \u2013 which I think is also very obvious, it is located in a very dense area within 10 miles of San Francisco and strategically located between the Silicon Valley and Downtown San Francisco. So it\u2019s a fabulous location with an unbelievable amount of traffic. I think that\u2019s important to note. The center is performing well. Our mall tenants\u2019 stores average $560 per square foot. Target is one of the best stores in the chain for Target. I will also say that the expansion that\u2019s underway with value oriented retailers on the exterior of the mall, like Nordstrom Rack and TJX and Ross is going to be a great addition. You may also note that Dave & Buster\u2019s recently opened up in the center and it\u2019s one of the top Dave & Buster\u2019s in the chain. The Macy\u2019s and the J.C. Penney are two of the best locations in the mall. You may also be aware that Macy\u2019s is closed within \u2013 I think, within 5 miles or 10 miles of Serramonte, two of their other stores, there was announced closings of those. And that the J.C. Penney store that they just opened up Sephora and it seems to be anecdotally performing extremely well. So the center is a good center and I think it\u2019s continuing to get better and it\u2019s a good center in a fabulous location and we feel very, very good about its future prospects.","Michael Mueller","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","Yes. Thank you. Prior to the merger, the small shop occupancy of Regency versus Equity One was separated by about 300 bps, it sounds like you might have closed that already, but my assumption here is that at some point, the Equity One will reach the level of Regency and if that\u2019s the case, how long do you think that takes to achieve?","Jim Thompson","Craig, this is Jim, I will answer that. As I have mentioned, I think we have had excellent leasing progress from both companies over the past several years on the side shop. I think we are obviously operating at high levels closing in on 92%. We think there is probably some opportunity to grow that, but really I think we are nearing full capacity in that side shop regime.","Hap Stein","We are focusing on continuing to increase that, but for us, by far investment partners, our shareholders, they expect anything more than that would not be appropriate. But obviously, the team is focused on taking 92% up to 93%, but any expectation, as Jim indicated would be \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be warrant.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And then just the winning centers versus losing centers, have you ever measured a benefit of maybe sales transfer when you saw a neighboring center close and how \u2013 what lift you might have gotten at your own center?","Hap Stein","I don\u2019t think we have measured that. It is going to be interesting to see how this plays out. But I do think there is going to be this acceleration that\u2019s occurring and bifurcation between winning and losing retailers and wanting to own and owning, fortunately shopping centers that are going to attract the winning retailers because they are convenient to the communities and neighborhoods that the winning retailers who excel at being relevant to the customers want to be located.","Craig Schmidt","And do you have a sense of why that is accelerating, because we have been overstored for quite a while now?","Hap Stein","I do think that that the combination of \u2013 my sense is and let me say it, it appears like there may be some acceleration that\u2019s occurring and that\u2019s kind of the \u2013 what we are believing is going to happen, but there is no guarantee that that will happen and kind of as we have always said, we are not going to be immune to the overabundance of space, e-commerce or retailers are not going to, but we think we are in a very good place to continue to attract the better retailers. And to \u2013 and I think a couple of things just keeping it 96% leased, almost 92% side-shop occupancy and as Lisa has now said twice, 95% of the space \u2013 first of all, we didn\u2019t experience the bankruptcies \u2013 that a lot of the bankruptcies occurred, but that \u2013 where we were impacted 95% of that space has either been at signed leases or in final stages of lease negotiations. And one last thing, our ongoing conversations with our tenant customers reinforces our points of view, whether it\u2019s a grocery store, side shop retailers or the value oriented retailers that we work with.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. Congratulations on completing the merger.","Hap Stein","Thanks Craig.","Jim Thompson","Thanks Craig.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Linda Tsai","Yes. Hi. Recognizing that your outlook for the impact from bankruptcies in 2017 is low relative to your competitors and this is the result of operating high quality properties, I am just wondering, when you compare the closures that sort of \u201816 versus \u201817, are there any observations you can draw between the types of centers where the closures occurred maybe as it relates to the size of the center or whether it was grocery anchored or are there any other characteristics worth noting?","Lisa Palmer","I mean I will let Jim add, but I mean just thinking about where our Sports Authorities were located last year as well as Eastern Mountain Sports where we had other bankruptcies plus this year\u2019s, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 there is really no specific trends. I mean they are across the country. As you know, we are mostly grocery anchored, so most of them are in grocery anchored centers. One thing I can say, it\u2019s going to be in centers with that have secondary anchors because they have got anchor space, but beyond that\u2026","Jim Thompson","Yes. Beyond that, I think so far we are seeing more small shop RadioShack and Payless. We have only got two boxes of Gordmans and Overton\u2019s that \u2013 and in both of those cases, we had \u2013 we are currently negotiating replacement tenants, so we are not seeing the big Sports Authority, which have \u2013 had a pretty big impact last year so.","Lisa Palmer","I mean, I will reiterate what Hap said in his prepared remarks and that is that there is going \u2013 that\u2019s not just winning \u2013 it\u2019s not winning and losing centers, it\u2019s really winning and losing retailers. And our strategy and what I believe we own are the centers where if there happens to be a losing retailer, which Sports Authority was one, bad news is good news. That\u2019s our strategy and that\u2019s the real estate that we want to own. So it\u2019s possible to have a failure in a great center and you know what, we welcome that.","Hap Stein","And we are not losers. We haven\u2019t been perfect. We won\u2019t be perfect. We are going to be impacted, but our track record is pretty gratifying of navigating those issues.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate everybody\u2019s time and interest in Regency. And I hope that you have a very good day and rest of the week. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"18130":["Regency Centers Corporation (NASDAQ:REG) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call May  4, 2016  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Mas - SVP of Capital Markets","Hap Stein - Chairman & CEO","Lisa Palmer - President & CFO","Mac Chandler - EVP, Development","Jim Thompson - EVP, Operations","Analysts","Jay Carlington - Green Street Advisors","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Anthony Hau - SunTrust","Greg Schweitzer - Deutsche Bank","Chris Lucas - CapitalOne Securities","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host Mike Mas.","Mike Mas","Good afternoon, and welcome to Regency's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Mac Chandler, Executive Vice President of Development; Jim Thompson, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we begin, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","We also request that callers observe a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Hap.","Hap Stein","Thanks Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Regency's team continues to execute well on the critical components of our well-honed strategy. The underlying fundamentals of our portfolio remain very healthy. This is evident by growth in core FFO per share of 8%, strong rate growth in occupancy and same property NOI growth of 4% for the seventh consecutive quarter.","We continue to reap the benefits from the quality of our portfolio amplified by the tail winds of favorable market conditions. Retail supply remains tight while demand for space in prime locations continues at a rational pace. We are experiencing particularly strong demand from quality quick-serve restaurants, health & fitness users, leading traditional grossers, discount para retailers and pet stores.","And while the fundamentals are healthy for most of the retail, restaurants and service companies, they are represented in our centers, fallout from industry store rationalization will continue. We are now obviously witnessing this play out in the sporting goods sector which include a bankruptcy filing of the sports authority in Eastern Mountain Sports. While there will likely be some impact or end of life growth, the quality of our real estate affords us the ability to cap on these opportunities in the long run.","We are placing a struggling operator with the more productive line, has been and always will be better for a long term NOI growth rate. Turning to development, our industry leading local teams continue to source compelling new development and re-development opportunities building the pipeline that positions us to start and deliver average of $200 million or more of exceptional projects.","This quarter we started one ground up project in Houston, located in a master plan community that includes Exxon's World Headquarters. A large scale re-development near Aventura Mall near Miami and completed two whole food centers one in D.C. and one in Dallas. As I said before the development business is not for novices. And the environment remains competitive for the limited opportunities that made our criteria.","With that said I believe we have the right team to capitalize on the expansion especially investing class traditional grossers. They continue to find investment opportunities supported by this expansion with demand from shop and category leading junior anchor retailers. As I look forward as we have a keen eye on the mature state of recovery, and understand the volatile nature of the capital markets, I am confident we are well positioned to continue our positive momentum.","Will we find ourselves in a pro-longed recovery or an economic downturn or whether the pace of rationalization accelerates, my confident stems from the outstanding quality of our portfolio, our disciplined and proven development capabilities, our rock solid balance sheet and our extremely talented team focused on growing shareholder value. Lisa?","Lisa Palmer","Thank you Hap and good afternoon everyone. NAREIT FFO for the quarter was $0.86 per share. This includes approximately $7 million of gains on land parcels as well as pursue costs related to acquisition activity which I will address later. These items together with expected additional acquisition pursue costs are incorporated into our new NAREIT FFO per share guidance range of $3.22 to $3.28.","This is an increase of $0.04 at both ends. As Hap noticed Core FFO for the first quarter increased 8% for the first quarter of 2015 and same property NOI growth once again exceeded 4%. Consistent with prior quarter's base rank continues to be the largest contributing factor. We do expect the property to analyze moderate throughout the moderate of the year as we expect higher costs for commenced, camera conciliations and the potential impact of the recently announced bankruptcies.","I also want to caution that the second quarter has the potential to fall below the bottom end of our guidance range. As the second quarter is the quarter where the majority of our prior year reconciliations are finalized. So with that said, our full year 2016 same property growth guidance remains unchanged at 2 and 3 quarters at 3.5%.","With respect to the recently announced bankruptcies the legal process remain fluid. Between sports authority and Easter Mountain Sports we have five locations at risk. We fully reserve against any unpaid pre-petition reg. After second situation specifically released two-tenths and studying the competitive positions of our impacted locations we developed what appears to be reasonable set of functions and probabilities supporting our same property growth rate range.","These assumptions included combination of accepted and rejected leases but do not include the scenarios of full-loss at every location. From an occupancy standpoint the same property portfolio rose back above 96% lease with shop base right at 92% lease. Move outs and bad debts remain low and we avoid the usual first quarter seasonal dip in occupancy.","This is a very good proxy for the underlying portfolio. As our portfolio achieved higher occupancy levels we are able to be very selective with merchandizing and leverage pricing power through better steps and strong releasing stretch. In fact, rent growth for new lease assigned during the first quarter was 50%. This is primarily due to the release of one of our Haggen bosses that we purchase out of bankruptcy. \u2018","We released it to one top specially grossers in Southern California. It's another classic example of where bad news is great news when you have the opportunity to re-merchandize or redevelop quality real estates as we have accomplished time and time again. Turning now to the capital markets activity. We seek out to enhance our balance sheet by astutely accessing capital to efficiently fund investments.","As we did with the forward offering completed in March. To that end we are leased to share some high level information on our pending acquisition activity as well as offer our general guidance on when we intend to draw down our forward equity. We currently have great visibility in the two acquisition opportunities. The first includes the retail portion of an iconic mixed-use property in Metro D.C. strategically located in island scenario which most of you do know that is one of the premier neighborhoods in that region. Consistent with our mixed use strategy we are partnering with Avalon Bay one of the most well respected in the industry. They will own and operate the residential component. The resale featured several key anchors and many leases below market, they are exceptional analyzed growth potential for even further upside redevelopment.","The second opportunity is located outside Seattle in a highly desirable sub-market that will augment our platform which is already deep in that market. This property will be a perfect addition to our North West portfolio. Combined this acquisition should approximate $325 million in total purchase price. And we expect to close on each before the end of the second quarter. For each closing we intend to draw down a portion of our forward equity offering while at the same time expanding our existing term loan facility to provide for an additional $100 million of debt capital. Our new amended term loan will have similar pricing of what it has today but will mature in 2022 adding 2.5 years to the existing maturity date.","The remaining forward equity proceeds will be available for additional acquisitions between now and June of next year. Finally, we closed on another great shopping center during the quarter. Garden City Park located on Long Island not only increases our presence in metro New York but also presented us with an immediate redevelopment opportunity.","This well located center offers significant upside with below market rent and re merchandizing potential. We plan to begin work on the redevelopment within the next 60 days. Most importantly of all, the NOI growth on levered IRR to Garden City and the two pending acquisitions are accretive to our portfolio.","To wrap it up I am very pleased with these quarter's results and the accomplishments our team has achieved. I thank you for listening and we now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Carlington with Green Street Advisors, please proceed with your question.","Jay Carlington","Hey thanks for taking the question. I guess just a follow up on Sports Authority in Eastern Mountain, can you give a little bit more color on the assumptions you are expecting there? How that impacts same property on a wide growth in 2016?","Hap Stein","Sure I will address what happened in the first quarter and then I will let Jim talk about with individual stores in what we are comfortable with saying in public anyways. So in my prepared remarks hopefully you heard that we do fully reserve all unpaid pre-petition rent. So for the first quarter that was approximately $250,000.","If you look at that in isolation, its' less than 20 basis points. However, obviously you can't really look at that in isolation, we evaluate the health of all our tenants and the remaining tenants in maybe Eastern Mountain Sports and few others that are struggling a little bit are extremely healthy. And going forward obviously I said in my prepared remarks, that we are assuming we already know for example one location that was a closed on our list but others, we just have a list of assumptions as to when that store may close if at all and we are assuming that some of them may be accepted.","So again just to reiterate, those assumptions are incorporated into the range in 2 or 3 quarters right now, I am not sure I am giving you that much more detail today.","Jay Carlington","Okay. So maybe as a quick follow up, you mentioned the Q2 weakness you are expecting here, is some of that more Sports Authority or that's more the comps that are effecting that?","Hap Stein","It's all free, higher comps from percent, the higher comps from camera reconciliation and then there is also the bankruptcies.","Jay Carlington","And maybe switching gears on the acquisition, is there a rough slit you can give on Seattle and D.C. in terms of the size and then can you maybe talk about what type of IRR you are underwriting for those acquisitions?","Hap Stein","So we increased our guidance to 340 and we have already closed on one property in the first quarter so basically the Seattle asset, we are not allowed to disclose the purchase price for the market common clarity at this time. Once we close on that we will be able to do that. So I would tell you that the Seattle asset is in the range of $35 million to $40 million per purchase price and then in terms of under-writing I would just again reemphasize that the NOI growth and the IRR composed are creative to our portfolio and also I will give you some color for current market.","As of this quality today if you were to talk to some of the brokers in the market, they will tell you that Gateway markets, they are trading at 5.5% of unlevered IRRs. And in market common ours is 75 to 100 basis points north of that and for the Seattle asset add another 100 blips to that so we feel very good about these acquisitions and the returns we are getting and we are able to add value with the expertise and talent that we have from our team. The Long Island is even better than that, double-digit IRRs, unleveraged, all unleveraged.","Jay Carlington","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Donnelly","Good afternoon folks, question on leasing trends. I am curious about leasing trends specifically for inline spaces. Are you able to break that our for us for new and renewal away from the activity?","Jim Thompson","Yes, on the shop space leasing we are basically 12.1% growth on the new and on the renewal I guess 12%, on the renewal per shop space and shop space is smaller than 10,000.","Jeff Donnelly","And maybe, I am curious how you are thinking about maximum occupancy your next goal because you are pretty close to 92% on small shop leasing and wondering if there is as far as you can push it or is there another goal post Regency is going to set where it wants to be?","Lisa Palmer","Many of you probably heard me say this before, we own 212 properties today, though 212 was the whole portfolio that we owned back in 2006 which was our priority and that same pool of properties for 2006 and 2007 was 96.7% and 96.6% lease so basically maintaining percent lease above 96.5% for over four quarters at least. So I do think we have a little bit more runway and you can't underestimate how much we have improved the quality of the portfolio from 10 years ago.","Jeff Donnelly","Was that shop occupancy or overall occupancy?","Lisa Palmer","That's overall occupancy. So the shop occupancy was north of 92%.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay. Understood and one other follow up, I think Regency has about 50 properties located outside of top 50 MSAs, it's not a big part of value or big part of base rent but many of those properties have rents that are inline or even above the base rent of your top 50 markets so do you see those assets or markets as a source of funds down the road or it just strikes me that they might have a weaker return on investment profile in your top 50 assets?","Unidentified Company Representative","I believe one of those markets is Raleigh Durham which is outside of top 50 markets Jeff and we see a very good not only about the portfolio but the portfolio in Raleigh or the upside of that so I mean you have to be careful about where that might be, so I feel good about the upside throughout the portfolio and we are all continuing to evaluate as we have proven in the past to sell those assets and shopping centers who have lower long term growth profile.","And the only other color I would add to that is often the - the university town will be outside of the top 50 and we have enjoyed significant growth in a lot of those assets as well.","Jeff Donnelly","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lena [ph] with J P Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, what are your plans for refinancing your perpetual preferred coming due next year?","Hap Stein","The perpetual preferred doesn't actually have a maturity date, that's what we really like about it so we have no intentions right now to either call next year but no plans to do that right now. That's the thing we really like about preferred stock.","Jim Thompson","And the call option which is our period.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Got it thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.","Rich Moore","Hello guys, good afternoon, first thing Lisa I am curious that you guys have always been Core FFO sort of place and I am really big on using NAREIT FFO but I get used to the idea that I was supposed to use Core FFO for Regency and now you are citing NAREIT FFO, are you switching the focus to NAREIT FFO, which I think would be great by the way but I am just curious if you are?","Lisa Palmer","Appreciate your opinion, over the last year probably longer we have been providing both and providing guidance on both. We think both are relative metrics and as long as we provide all of the information and are fully [ph] so that you all see what is in Core FFO and what is not, we'll continue to report both.","Unidentified Speaker","Yes, Rich we noted NAREIT FFO in press releases because we updated that range so we only update the ranges that are impacted.","Rich Moore","Yes, okay thank you and then I am curious on Houston, we have heard all this concern about Houston and it clearly hasn't come to pass and you guys have roughly 5% or so of AVR there, how is Houston doing if I was to start another project there and do you have any specific like same growth metrics for the market or anything you can share specifically on Houston?","Hap Stein","Yes, on our portfolio itself it's one of our stronger portfolio. We have got 7 out of 10 properties that are located in master plan communities. Out of that portfolio we are 98.7% leased today. Q1 we are seeing 6.6% property NOI growth so we feel very good about that market, retailers are pressing strong sales which continue to drive expansion and we are real comfortable with the market today. Yes, this is - it's part of the reason why we like the Springwoods, it shows similar characteristics. It's got - being a master plan community. It's anchored by one of the top grossers in long term base and we have seen results. We have got great producing activity or 71% lease-to-date following [indiscernible] 8% so we love that and we think that's why we are really in Houston and we would love to see more opportunities similar to this one.","Rich Moore","Okay. Good thank you and I sort of had the same question as a follow up on the San Francisco, Oakland MSA as well because now that's the new hot spot where San Francisco is going to become the new ghost town because of the technology and I wonder if you guys are seeing any softness there?","Mac Chandler","Yes, I think I can speak to that. This is Mac and we are not, I think that's the large part because of our centers. We have great centers, they are with big grossers, and they are necessity based retailer for the large part so part of what makes them unique is tremendous [indiscernible] in the past cycles so it's very supply constrained and are performing really quite well and we're not going to lose about that market, it's one of our best portfolios.","Rich Moore","Okay. Great thanks guys.","Mac Chandler","Thanks Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Hau with SunTrust, please proceed with your question.","Anthony Hau","Good afternoon guys the story in part of this call so someone maybe already asked this question but can you comment on why the lease occupancy went down by 200 bips?","Mac Chandler","Sure, this is Mac. It's pretty simple in that case, we actually signed a lease with a hair salon and prior to us delivering the space to them they ran into some trouble at some other locations and they basically backed out of the lease and we have backups we are already talking to so.","Hap Stein","It's not about the whole thing on where we are on the leasing standpoint even though the center has just been completed.","Mac Chandler","Yes, the Whole Foods opened last month and they are doing tremendous, well above their projections. If you get a chance, this side of the North Orange County, it is one of our best developed, best looking asset and that's merchandise asset so we are 90% leased. We could have reached really two or three times over, we have turned away a lot of cash so we have been very patient and we held out a couple of spaces and we really see no issues getting those spaces leased up. So if you are in Southern California please take a chance to stop by.","Anthony Hau","One last question, I know that Sports Authority didn't have a huge impact on the portfolio and hence you guys have only three stores but have you guys adjusted those stores ready and are there any potential upsides for those boxes?","Mac Chandler","Yes, we have already talked about those properties, I will let Jim talk about the real estate.","Jim Thompson","In general I wouldn't expect to see a lot of upside but at the end of the day we are comfortable with the real estate, there will be good demand for our retail spaces.","Hap Stein","As we said in our prepared remarks, to replace the struggling operator with a better operator is going to be better for the long term.","Anthony Hau","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Schweitzer from Deutsche Bank, please proceed with your question.","Greg Schweitzer","Hi everyone, just going back to - just apologize if I missed the spec. in terms of the upside from the market leases that you mentioned with the retail component almost fully leased, when do some of those leases rollover where you could realize those gains?","Hap Stein","We have retailed the entire Basin building which has some upside as well, I don't Greg if you have had an opportunity to visit the center, and it's across the street. No, that's what we are buying so there are different parts within the center. The main retail component is anchored by Barnes & Noble and I will agree when I said the prepared remarks, that would be half the example of where bad news would be great news. As we would love to get that space back. But the center was built a little over 10 years ago, we would expect we are going to really realize some of that growth profit, it will certainly increase over the next 12 months but I think you will see the bigger step certainly in 2018 as when we start to see growth in the underlying.","Greg Schweitzer","And then on the potential redevelopment that you mentioned could you share any details on the scope or what you are thinking about there?","Hap Stein","It\u2019s really early in the process and there are many different alternatives so it's a little too early to share much detail but it is a potential to be retail and perhaps multifamily shop, could be all retail, there could be a potential of moving some of the candidates to that, the other existing candidates to that location but it's way too early. We could lease it till one year though.","Greg Schweitzer","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is Chris Lucas from CapitalOne Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Lucas","Yes, hi good afternoon everyone, just a follow up on market comments, is there an office component to that I believe is that correct?","Lisa Palmer","So we really are evaluating the different alternatives as to what we may do with that parcel and no decisions have been made. No matter what we do there will be significant offices from what is existing there today.","Chris Lucas","Can you guys disclose what the relationship is, is it sort of percentage ownership between you and Avalon at this point, has it been discussed?","Lisa Palmer","Go for it Mike.","Mike Mas","Chris it's not the way we have seen it, written about, talked about as a joint venture and although technically we will close as JV the idea is to kind of minimize immediately so we will have to make a structure out of it. So we will have physical and legal ownership of only our component. We can't at this point in time unfortunately talk about purchased price details and the difference between the multifamily retail and looking forward to doing that on closing and you will release a press release at that time.","Hap Stein","We will get all the economic benefits from the retail and Avalon will get all the economic benefits from the multifamily and we expect to have the thing before the end of the year.","Mac Chandler","I would like to reiterate, as Mac said, as you know typically we are not releasing the purchase price prior to closing so as soon as that happens more than happy to share that information publicly.","Chris Lucas","Can I just go back and tie though the office building ownership into that? Kind of where does that?","Mac Chandler","That is 100% ours.","Chris Lucas","That is yours that is your upside?","Mac Chandler","Correct.","Chris Lucas","Thank you that's all I needed.","Mac Chandler","We look at that as a vacant building with significant amount of upstart.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Hap Stein for closing comments.","Hap Stein","We appreciate your time wish you a great rest of the week and a terrific weekend. Thank you very much."],"18583":["Regency Centers Corporation (NASDAQ:REG) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February  2, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","","Hap Stein \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Brian Smith \u2013 President and Chief Operating Officer","Bruce Johnson \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Lisa Palmer \u2013 Senior Vice President, Capital Markets","Chris Leavitt \u2013 Senior Vice President and Treasurer","","","Analysts","","[Michael Bellarmine] \u2013 Citi ","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Chris Lucas - Robert Baird","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","[Tao Akesanya] \u2013 Jeffries and Company","Todd Lukasic \u2013 Morningstar","[Gaonton Gar] \u2013 Credit Suisse","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen and Company","Wes Golladay \u2013 RBC  Capital Markets","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","[Semi Farique] \u2013 ISI","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","","","","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Regency Centers Corporation Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets, Ms. Lisa Palmer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.   ","Lisa Palmer","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call this morning are Hap Stein, Chairman and CEO; Brian Smith, President and COO; Bruce Johnson, CFO and Chris Leavitt, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. ","Before we start, I'd like to address forward-looking statements that may be discussed on the call. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Hap?","Hap Stein","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. As I stated at Investor Day, Regency\u2019s executive team is committed to regain our standing as a blue chip shopping center company by achieving four critical objectives, which I shared with you then, and I want to very briefly review with you now. ","First, generating dependable NOI growth of 3%. Second, reinvigorating a disciplined development program that will add significant value to the portfolio. Third, further strengthening the balance sheet and assuring access to capital, and fourth, compounding recurring funds from operations and NAV per share by 5%. ","As I reflect back on 2011, I am gratified by the progress the team has made in positioning 2012 to be a turnaround year for Regency. I\u2019d like to now highlight those key accomplishments that will be important building blocks for both 2012 and the sustainable achievement of these four objectives in subsequent years. ","We leased nearly 7 million square feet of space, including 2 million square feet of new leases, and that strong tenant demand is continuing. We increased occupancy in the operating portfolio to 93.5% and this represents the highest level in three years. ","We sold on a pro rata basis more than $90 million of operating properties and recycled the capital into $110 million of dominant grocery-anchored shopping centers with much better prospects for future growth in NOI. We started over $95 million of new development and nearly $25 million of redevelopments or expansions at attractive returns of more than 9%. ","In addition, we sold or converted to development almost $30 million of land held and we took further steps to improve the balance sheet. Among these was renewing our $600 million line of credit, closing on a $250 million term loan, and refinancing more than $500 million of mortgages in our co-investment partnerships. ","In addition to this significant progress, there are several other important reasons and I\u2019m confident that our focus strategy will soon start translating into performance that will manifest into the ultimate measure, total shareholder return in excess of our shopping center peers. ","It all starts with our exceptional people. Many of you have had first-hand opportunities to see how good they are through our investor relations group or on property tours. Regency\u2019s team and our enduring customer relationships are advantages that enable Regency to fully leverage our other essential assets, expertly execute our strategy, and effectively accomplish our critical goals and objectives. ","It is clear to me our key customers truly recognize the value of Regency\u2019s platform and generally respect and appreciate doing business with our people. In the mind of our retailers, brokers, our co-investment partners, and other key stakeholders, Regency is a blue chip company. In fact, the vast majority of Regency\u2019s portfolio contains dominant grocery-anchored shopping centers that are located in attractive markets. Our experience has shown that centers with highly productive grocery anchors attract better side shop retailers, maintain and grow occupancy and produce reliable NOI. ","Let me take a moment to remind you of the key attributes of the portfolio. 87% is in a top 50 market. Average household income of approximately $100,000, three mile density of over 90,000 people, and grocery sales that we\u2019re proud to publish of $25 million and $500 per square foot. ","In 2012, we\u2019ll place even greater focus on selling the small segment of the portfolio, including legacy developments that we determine might be a drag on NOI, and buying centers that will enhance future growth. Regency\u2019s capability to manufacture dominant grocery-anchored shopping centers in attractive markets on a basis that is accretive to NAV, and especially to the price at which we could acquire comparable properties, is an essential Regency advantage. We have incorporated the valuable lessons learned and are focusing on the construction and repositioning of core shopping centers that we want on long term. ","And last, Regency has a sound balance sheet and access to multiple sources of capital.  Perhaps that\u2019s the most important lesson from the recent financial crisis that the balance sheet maturities and access to capital are critical. We are committed to maintaining and even enhancing substantial financial flexibility while we are aware we are still operating in an uncertain and fragile environment. I believe that the accomplishments of 2011, combined with these four attributes and resilient retailer demand for space in our shopping centers, have positioned Regency to make even more meaningful progress this year. Bruce?","Bruce Johnson","Thank you, Hap and good morning on this beautiful day in Jacksonville, Florida. ","As Hap pointed out, as a result of the proactive steps we\u2019ve taken, our balance sheet is in good shape. Let me recap the year highlights. We renewed our $600 million line of credit on an extremely favorable basis and we\u2019ve closed on a $250 million unsecured term loan to repay the bonds that matured in January. This term loan is fully pre-payable without penalty providing us with the flexibility to delever when it makes sense to do so. ","This means that as of the end of January we had more than $600 million of available capacity between the line and the term loan. We also secured more than $500 million of mortgage finance in our co-investment partnerships with terms that exceeded tenures and raised, at average, 4.7%. Finally, [Caster\u2019s] committed $100 million of equity to our partnership with them. ","As a result of our efforts of the last several years, we have improved our debt profile by reducing the amount of debt outstanding and meaningfully extending the average maturity date with our wholly owned and co-investment portfolios. ","I\u2019d like to turn now to capital recycling. In 2011, we disposed of 13 non-core properties. The average cap rate was 7.8% and we acquired five dominant grocery-anchored centers at an average cap rate of just over 6%. ","In January we entered the New York market with a strategic acquisition of Lake Grove Commons in partnership with First Washington and [Calper\u2019s]. Lake Grove is an A+ asset located in Long Island. The center is anchored by Whole Foods with substantial embedded NOI growth from contractual rent increases. This investment represents an opportunity to expand Regency\u2019s presence into the New York market providing traction for potential future acquisitions. ","We will continue to recycle capital to enhance future NOI growth prospects. As Hap mentioned, if the right opportunities arise, we would consider expanding the pool of properties that we determine we don\u2019t want to own on a long-term basis. Obviously, these sales may trigger gains or losses. ","Looking ahead, our guidance for 2012 is unchanged from what we presented in December. However, it\u2019s important to point out that we expect to be approximately 93% leased at the end of the first quarter. This is for two reasons. 20 basis points is related to the movement of properties to the same property pool. The remainder is due to projected move outs, which are typically higher in the first quarter of the year, however, I am comfortable that we\u2019ll be close to the 94% lease by year end and that 2012 same property NOI growth, excluding term fees, will be in the range of 1.5% to 3%. Brian?","Brian Smith","Thanks, Bruce, and good morning. As you heard from Hap, we\u2019re starting to see the fruits of our efforts. By just about any metric you choose, there was good improvement in the portfolio during 2011. While that improvement hasn\u2019t fully manifested itself, it is setting the table for higher levels of NOI growth. ","Let me run through a few of those metrics. After the seasonal dip in the first quarter of 2011, we saw three straight quarters of positive absorption. Absorption for both the fourth quarter and the full year were the best we\u2019ve ever had. What was more impressive to me was the absorption for operating spaces less than 10,000 square feet was also positive for three consecutive quarters and for the full year. ","Never before have we had better quarterly or annual absorption for small shops. Better absorption comes from better move outs and leasing and we did a lot of leasing in 2011, more than any other prior year, again, for both the operating portfolio as a whole and for our small shops. The level of new leasing was nearly 40% higher than the average of the last five years. We also signed 25% more renewals than the average of that same period. ","We not only leased space, we did it with great retailers that enhance the quality of our portfolio. We did a lot of repeat business signing multiple leases with national chains such as Petco, TJ Maxx, Chase, Starbucks, Great Clips, Chipotle, Five Guys and others.","I mentioned move outs were better. They\u2019ve been gradually improving since late 2009, but the improvement was really evident as we ended the year with three straight quarters of lower move outs resulting in the lowest annual level since 2007. Best of all, the level of small shop move outs was the lowest since 2006, which is really encouraging. As a result of this leasing progress and favorable impact on occupancy from dispositions, the operating portfolio was 93.5% leased. For the quarter, we had occupancy gains in all size ranges. ","I draw your attention to one of those ranges\u2014our small shops and spaces less than 10,000 square feet, which ended the year 87% leased. That is meaningfully higher than a year ago. Developments contributed as well. Occupancy in those properties increased 630 basis points to over 88% leased contributing nearly $4 million of additional NOI. This increase in development leasing, together with growing our small shop percent lease to 87% represent two very significant accomplishments. ","We\u2019ve talked in the past about how our tenants\u2019 health metrics were all heading in the right direction, and by any measure, they are much healthier today. We discussed in the past that retail survivors have learned how to manage costs and inventory to succeed in a tough environment, but for the first time in a while, our tenants are reporting modest sales increases. We heard about top line improvement across most of the portfolio. As a result, there\u2019s a lot more optimism and confidence out there on the part of the retailers. ","Furthermore, many of our grocery anchor customers are also projecting solid 2011 annual sales growth from their stores in our portfolio. There\u2019s another increasing trend we\u2019ve seen in the regions. It appears that retailers are exercising their stated options more frequently instead of rejecting the option and trying to renegotiate it. If this continues, it would suggest a potential shift in pricing power. ","All these things, along with our much lower AR balance and notable decrease in small shop move outs I mentioned earlier, point to a healthier tenant base. Those are all good trends and it is important progress that we\u2019ll soon be paying dividends and same property NOI growth, and there are other metrics as well that also give me reason to be optimistic. ","Total NOI growth was positive 1.7% if you include developments on the same property basis. Rent paying occupancy in the operating portfolio increased 60 basis points, over 91%. As we move closer to 95% occupancy in the next couple years, we should start benefitting from more pricing power. Most important of all, based on what we\u2019ve seen in January, the strong leasing momentum and trend of reduced move outs appear to be continuing. ","Let me now turn to development. We started two new developments in the fourth quarter. After a bruising seven-year entitlement battle, we\u2019re ready to take the land in Sonoma County, California out of  inventory and begin our East Washington Place development. It\u2019s a strong lineup of anchors \u2013 Target, Sprouts, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and TJ Maxx\/HomeGoods combo store, and they are helping attract other top-notch retailers like Beverages and More and Alta."," This will be the best located retail center in the city of Petaluma and it\u2019ll be a great addition to the portfolio. We know there will always be tight supply constraints in this market, given the city\u2019s demonstrated no growth attitude. In northern California real estate circles, this development really is creating a buzz. We\u2019ve received extensive interest from national retailers for the side shop space and the return on the incremental cost is approximately 9.5%.","The second development, Northgate Marketplace, which is located in Medford, Oregon, will be anchored by the perfect grocer for Oregon, Trader Joe\u2019s. Also anchoring the center will be REI, Alta and Petco. This is the best site in Medford at the intersection of the city\u2019s three most heavily trafficked highways and directly adjacent to the super regional mall. Medford is a proven, very successful market for retailers with several national anchor tenants claiming their Medford stores are among the best in their chains. ","In addition to ground up projects, our development expertise gives us the ability to harvest value from our operating properties through expansion and redevelopment. We started two such projects this quarter. The first was the addition of TJ Maxx at our Golden Hills property in Paso Robles, California, which is also anchored by Lowe\u2019s and Bed, Bath and Beyond, and we have space to accommodate Petco and Five Below at the Target-anchored Lower Nazareth Commons that\u2019s adjacent to Wegmans in Pennsylvania. These expansions enhance existing assets, they drive additional traffic, and they make them more desirable to potential new tenants and provide us with impressive returns of about 11%, all with relatively low levels of risk. ","In summary, I know that we\u2019ve still got plenty of work to do, but I am more confident than ever that we\u2019re going to show the results we expect. We\u2019re going to accomplish our goals of improving occupancy and seeing property growth in 2012 and successfully execute our development and redevelopment strategy. Hap?","Hap Stein","Thanks, Brian and thanks, Bruce. In closing, I have no doubt that Regency is not only on the path to recovery, but more importantly, is on the right road to reestablishing our preeminent standing with you. ","Before I turn the call over to questions and answers, I have to take this moment and comment on the announcement a couple weeks ago of Bruce\u2019s plans to retire at the end of the year. To say this is a bittersweet moment is a major understatement. Bruce\u2019s leadership, his experience, his judgment and financial acumen have been instrumental in successfully building Regency into a leading national shopping center company. He\u2019s part of our heritage and he epitomizes those attributes that make our culture and the people of Regency so really special. ","At the same time, Regency is fortunate to have Lisa, another consummate professional and wonderful person in the same mold as Bruce, to succeed him in January 2013. Many of you had the privilege to work with Lisa over the years and already know of her strengths and accomplishments. ","As I indicated, Bruce will not be retiring until the end of the year. Until then, we will continue to benefit from his full-throttled effort, leadership and judgment as we build on improving fundamentals in this crucial year. ","We thank you for your time and welcome any questions you may have.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. ","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Brian, I think you said it was 87% small shop occupancy at year end. One, what was the sequential improvement, and then where do you think that number can go by year end?","","Brian Smith ","The sequential improvement was 110 basis points and we\u2019re expecting by the end of the year to have somewhere in the neighborhood of 300,000 square feet of positive absorption, and that\u2019s pretty much all coming from the small shops, so that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get to approximately 94%. ","Hap Stein","I would say that small shop would be between we are today -- We may take a dip in the first quarter, but we ought to be, by the end of the year, between where we are today and 90%. ","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Second question, I remember from the Investor Day for 2012, the GNA expectation picked up a little bit. I guess what Bruce\u2019s retirement in \u201913 and just thinking about the development pipeline being a little bit bigger by then and maybe you\u2019re capitalizing more. Should we expect to see GNA dip in 2013?","Hap Stein","I think that the rate of growth should reduce and we are actively in an efficient basis to reduce the rate of growth. ","Lisa Palmer","Mike, I\u2019d just like to add to make sure that everyone is clear, even though we came in slightly favorable for 2011, our guidance for \u201912 remains unchanged, because a large part of what was driving the favorable variance were health insurance claims that we do not expect to recur in 2012, so the guidance for 2012 remains $58.5 million to $62.5 million. ","Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you. ","","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from [Michael Bellarmine] with Citi. ","","[Michael Bellarmine] \u2013 Citi ","Good morning. It\u2019s actually [Michael Bellarmine] with Quentin. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the occupancy and the leased rates the end of the year in the same store pool in [93-8], that obviously was ahead of where you thought you would be in December of 93 to 93.5, so it sounds like the move outs were a lot less, but I think from Bruce\u2019s comments, there was some talk that you head down about 60 bips in the first quarter as you expect those move outs to occur, and I just wonder if you could just put a little bit of color around -- it was, I guess, about 125,000 \u2013 150,000 square feet. What sort of tenants, have they already moved out, or just what the expectations are and why you think they\u2019re eventually now going to leave. ","Brian Smith","We tend to just historically, in the first quarter, have more move outs. That happened in, certainly, the last two years. It\u2019s pretty much a seasonal thing we see every year. So, we expect that\u2019s going to happen in first quarter. We\u2019re planning on it, anyway. Our experience so far in January has been less than what we\u2019ve planned for, but that\u2019s an annual thing that happens. ","","Hap Stein","In addition, as we mentioned, it isn\u2019t all due to seasonal move outs. Some of it is due to including new properties into the pool. ","","[Michael Bellarmine] \u2013 Citi ","Right, which I think Bruce said was 20, and then I guess to get down to 93, 20 from the same store and 60 from move outs, but at the end of the year, you were certainly much higher than you thought you would be in December, and if those people didn\u2019t move out in December, and it sounds like they haven\u2019t moved out yet in January. I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on in terms of how conservative you may be in thinking about the guidance. ","Brian Smith","We may be. We just don\u2019t know. Again, historically, for the first quarter we\u2019re going to have negative absorption and then we\u2019re planning in the next three quarters to be very positive from there. The question is does January represent all of the first quarter. January is the month we expect to be the worst of the three months in January, and like I said, we\u2019re about 100,000 square feet better on the negative net absorption side than what we planned. I just don\u2019t know whether that will maintain that improvement throughout the rest of the quarter or not. ","[Michael Bellarmine] \u2013 Citi ","And then just a question on the acquisition in New York. Hap, I think you mentioned it was with First Washington. Was that the first capital outlay since buying back the portfolio a couple years ago? Because it sounded like Bill had been pretty quiet in putting new capital out, so I was just wondering if there\u2019s been a change of strategy and getting comfortable with the yields today. ","Hap Stein","That was the first that we\u2019ve done together. They have made other investments that, for whatever reason, we decided not to do together. They\u2019re in the market and would like to deploy more capital. ","[Michael Bellarmine] \u2013 Citi ","And comfortable with the going in yields in the fives, low sixes?","Hap Stein","If you\u2019re going there and you can either get good dependable growth like we\u2019ve got in Lake Grove, or even there\u2019s maybe more upside and your total return is better, I think we\u2019re pretty much on the same page there together as far as what we\u2019re looking for. ","[Michael Bellarmine] \u2013 Citi ","Okay, thank you. ","","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. I was wondering if there was an expansion potential at Lake Grove Commons. I\u2019m just looking at the acres and the existing FAR seems kind of low. ","","Brian Smith","I don\u2019t think so. What you\u2019re got there, Craig, are two very high-volume anchors. You\u2019ve got the LA Fitness and when we\u2019ve been to that site, it is packed. The health clubs take disproportionate amount of the parking, anyway, so what we don\u2019t want to do is impinge upon that parking and therefore potentially hurt the sales of Whole Foods, Petco or our small shops. ","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and I just wondered, are you looking at further acquisitions in Long Island? And, what might be your cap rate if you looked out three years given the fixed rent increases? ","Hap Stein","We should be over 6% return by then and that is a target market for us. ","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Possibly with Blumenfeld?","Hap Stein","Possibly with Blumenfeld, yes. ","","Craig Schmidt \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks a lot. ","","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Christy McElroy with UBS. ","","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Hi. Good morning, everyone. You\u2019ve talked about converting a portion of your land into core development projects over the next few years and you did that in Q4 with East Washington Place. Of the $75 million to $150 million of development starts you\u2019re forecasting in \u201912, how much of that is comprised of projects where you expect to use the land already owned? Do you expect the yields on those to be similar to the East Washington in the sevens? ","","Brian Smith","Let me just check. In 2012 it looks like we really only have one property that\u2019s going to be coming up of land held and that would be similar in the sense that it would be about a seven, or in the sevens on total cost, and more like about 14% on incremental income. ","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","You\u2019re thinking about those projects more on an incremental basis than on an all-in?","Brian Smith","We\u2019re going to report both, obviously, but the costs are what they are so we\u2019re going to have to report total costs, but they also sunk costs, so the question is how do we get out of those, and if we can deploy the additional capital returns that are that attractive, then that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. ","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Given that you just transferred a pretty substantial amount of development projects into the completed bucket, are those now considered operating properties? I know you mentioned a potential impact on Q1 in transferring properties to the operating pool, but       did their inclusion have any impact on the occupancy numbers in Q4? When should we start seeing these properties impacting same store growth?","Lisa Palmer","Christy, this is Lisa. I\u2019ll answer that. Yes, as of December 31st all of those development completions are in our percent leased for operating properties, not necessarily same properties. To be considered a same property, the anchor would have had to have been open as of January 1st, 2011. So, not all of those would be considered same property. We can go offline and specifically give you a list of those that will be added to the same property pool. ","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","So in Q4 \u201912,  this same store on a wide growth number should include the impact of these properties?","Lisa Palmer","It\u2019s got to be a full calendar year, so again, if the anchor was open January 1, 2011 and it was substantially complete, basically, so more than 90% funded, then that would become a same property pool. Some of those that weren\u2019t open then will have to wait until 2013 before they actually hit same property. ","Christy McElroy \u2013 UBS","Okay, thank you. ","Hap Stein","Thank you, Christy. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley. ","","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. On the targeted dispositions, can you just give a little bit of color? Obviously, you\u2019re looking at accelerating it this year versus last year. Is the market for those non-core assets any better? Is it kind of potential improvements in the same market a factor or are you just going to be more aggressive this year. Is it mostly still one-offs?","Hap Stein","We\u2019re considering all that, where I do think we may have an advantage from a sales standpoint as those assets that are unencumbered, but the key criteria we\u2019re going to look at is is this going to be a drag on future NOI growth, and that\u2019s the criteria that we look at, and\/or what\u2019s the visibility from here for NOI going up or going down. ","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","What\u2019s the geographic composition of the pool?","Hap Stein","All over the country. And, once again, it depends. ","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","On demand?","Hap Stein","It depends on market\/demand and it depends on our view of our future outlook for the property. ","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and then on the development starts, you\u2019ve talked a lot about being more conservative in terms of shop space and the risk that you take on with projects. Is that being reflected in the starts that you\u2019re commencing this year? Have you scaled back from your original plan in the amount of shop space, and by what percentage?","Hap Stein","The key issue is what\u2019s the individual demand for the specific project. In certain instances, no shop space may make sense, and in certain other instances, 45,000 \u2013 50,000 square feet may make sense, so what Brian and the team are doing is calibrating what\u2019s the visible demand for side shop space and when it\u2019s appropriate, we\u2019re also phasing it. ","Brian Smith","It\u2019s exactly right. If you look at what\u2019s been started this year and in the last couple years, as Hap said, some of those had very little. I think we\u2019ve averaged about 15,000 square feet over what we\u2019ve put in place, but some of them had none and some of them had a lot. Not a lot, but they\u2019ve had more. ","If you look at the two we\u2019re announcing this quarter, in Medford, Oregon we\u2019re doing limited amounts, maybe 15,000 square feet, whereas the one in northern California, there\u2019s tremendous demand, so we\u2019re going to build much more there. ","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. ","","Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs","Good morning, everyone. Brian, given the encouraging signs that you\u2019re seeing in terms of occupancy, and I\u2019m just focusing here on the inline space, could you give us some sense of the market on rents, and I guess the question here is if you\u2019re starting to see this pickup in occupancy, are you going to start to focus a bit more, maybe, on pushing rate throughout the year? ","Brian Smith","Yeah, we\u2019re certainly focused on it. What we\u2019re dealing with, I think, are a couple of things. We still are dealing with some high rents. For example, if you look at northern California, we\u2019ve got pricing power in the San Francisco Bay area, but we just did a lease for our Powell Street project at $48 a square foot, but it was coming off of a $51. So, on one hand, we\u2019ve got markets where we\u2019re seeing increased stability to push rents, but some of those markets we pushed real aggressively before the downturn. But overall, I think we are seeing some positive things. ","The property manager\u2019s reporting that across the country there is an increased ability to drive rents. Not all properties, not all markets, but as a general trend, yes. If you look at our numbers, if we look at all spaces including those that have been vacant for more than a year, the new was negative but it was less than half as negative as the average three quarters, and if you focus on those that are just less than 12 months, we actually had rent growth on new spaces of over 5%. ","So, in the leverage system, all aspects of the leasing seems to be returning a little bit more. We are exercising those termination rights and getting rid of the weaker tenants that would be hard to grow rents. We are getting better rent bumps and what we\u2019ve seen so far in January is stronger rent growth. ","Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs","Okay, and maybe back to Paul\u2019s question on the sales candidates versus the core assets, is there a breakout of NOI growth between what you\u2019re potentially selling and what remains the core assets?","Hap Stein","Typically, what we may be selling is we\u2019re saying meaningfully higher growth than what we\u2019re buying than what we\u2019re selling, and let\u2019s leave it at that. ","Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you. ","","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from [Tao Akesanya] with Jeffries and Company. ","[Tao Akesanya] \u2013 Jeffries and Company","Just in regards to your economic outlook. If the economy does end up being a little bit better than you\u2019re anticipating, do you think you\u2019ll probably see more strength in regards to pricing, or more of an ability to generate more occupancy in your small shop space, and conversely, as well. If the economy got worse, which of those two do you think could give way first?","Hap Stein","Number one, I think that we are seeing, as Brian indicated, a very resilient demand for space and as he indicated, we\u2019re starting to feel more pricing power and I think that feeling is real, obviously to the extent that we get more of the economy behind us, that\u2019s going to improve because there\u2019s less supply that\u2019s been out there, especially a better space, so I think it would take an effective downturn in the economy to swing to reduce the tenant demand for space and pricing power, in effect, swinging back and the momentum going in the other direction. ","[Tao Akesanya] \u2013 Jeffries and Company","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Todd Lukasic with Morningstar. ","Todd Lukasic \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning. Thanks. Just a quick housekeeping question first on a GAAP basis income statement, the other expense line, $44.9 million. Is that mainly due to write offs of predevelopment costs or is there something else in there?","Brian Smith","It would be a combination of that and our income taxes. Other amounts are related to reserves we\u2019ve put up for environmental costs or insurance reserves on liability claims, those kind of things. ","Todd Lukasic \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thanks, and then just with regards to the side shop space, you guys are making some nice progress renting that up, obviously. I\u2019m just wondering what you view as sort of a normalized level of vacancy for that side shop space. ","Brian Smith ","Probably where we were before the downturn, which is really up in about the 91% range. ","Todd Lukasic \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Hap Stein","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to [Gaonton Gar] with Credit Suisse. ","","[Gaonton Gar] \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, guys. Just another question on the small shop space. What kind of tenants are you seeing demand from, and going into 2012, are there any specific industries or tenants in your portfolio that you would be concerned about? ","","Brian Smith","Again, we\u2019ve been focusing for the last few years on mostly the national, the regionals. Very, very little leasing is being done with true mom and pop shops, so I don\u2019t see any reason why that wouldn\u2019t continue, although we are hearing that financing is returning to the small shops but, again, that\u2019s not been something that\u2019s held us back in the past, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect us that much going forward. ","There\u2019s a couple of categories of small towns that we worry about. I would say that the dry cleaners are certainly one we\u2019ve been seeing some weakness in. Tanning salons, we\u2019ve been seeing some weakness in, and then we\u2019ve got the ones that are well  known to everybody. If there\u2019s any remaining video or the book category, those kind of things. ","Hap Stein","We had limited exposure there. We\u2019ve got limited exposure to Best Buy, and in the case of Sears, I think, as Brian says, bad news would be good news. ","[Gaonton Gar] \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right. Very helpful. And, you spoke about financing coming back. Are you hearing about any specific initiatives by the SBA which might be helping some of your mom and pop kind of tenants?","Brian Smith","I think I just mentioned that there is more Small Business Association financing out there but we have not been needing that in terms of increasing our occupancy. We\u2019ve been leasing to stronger chains, national, regional and so forth, but it certainly can\u2019t hurt us as some of the smaller players decide to get back in the market because there\u2019s financing available, that can only help us. ","[Gaonton Gar] \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right. Thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company. ","","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen and Company","Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions, guys. As you move out of the legacy development and some of the transactions where you have some significant sum costs and look at new developments, there has been\u2014and correct me if I\u2019m wrong on this\u2014but there\u2019s been significant growth by some of the smaller footprint grocers in terms of unit growth, and I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing more of that, or if my impression is wrong, number one, and the 20,000 \u2013 30,000 square foot box rather than the bigger box. ","And, curious if you\u2019re seeing more of that, number one, and number two, how you underwrite those. Do you underwrite them any differently or not in terms of projected stabilized yield?","Brian Smith","We are definitely seeing more of them, particularly in some regions. If you look at who\u2019s really expanding, it seems to be all over the map. You\u2019ve got the Kroger\u2019s and the HEB\u2019s, which are growing very large, putting very large stores into production. On the traditional size, I\u2019d say the one that\u2019s grown the most would be Publix. ","But, what you\u2019re seeing, particularly in California, would be almost a grocer war in northern California with all these smaller concepts. You\u2019ve got the fresh market, you\u2019ve got Sprouts, you\u2019ve got Sunflower, Fresh & Easy, just a lot of that going on \u2013 Trader Joe\u2019s, of course, and we have not done much with them. We\u2019ve put some in our existing centers. ","We are doing a little bit, and in terms of underwriting it, we factor that in with the other risk metrics, the amount of shop space, how much preleasing is done, but we tend to go with the better operators, so we\u2019re not doing any new developments for Fresh & Easy. We kind of factor the risk in that way. We\u2019d just rather not do it. Sprouts, we have been comfortable, and, as you saw, the one we put them in is this one we\u2019re doing in Petaluma and they\u2019re not the credit town of the whole deal, so we\u2019re comfortable with that. ","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen and Company","If we think in terms of incremental dollars into new developments, we don\u2019t have sum costs in the land, where would you like your yields to be, and maybe if you could contrast that with, say, where they were at the height of the development cycle the last time around.  ","Hap Stein","I think if we can generate on a good infill site returns above 8%, it\u2019s going to be a meaningful accretion to where you\u2019d buy that shopping center on the open market today. So, we\u2019d like to get 9%, but as I said, if we can get returns in the 8.5% range, what we\u2019re focusing on today, which are dominant core shopping centers, especially in infill markets or markets that are tough to develop in, I think we\u2019ll be doing well. ","Jim Sullivan \u2013 Cowen and Company","Good, thanks. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. ","","Wes Golladay \u2013 RBC  Capital Markets","Good morning, everyone. Now that five years have passed since the market peaked, are you seeing any meaningful headwinds on the renewal front from those leases signed five years ago?","Brian Smith","No, we\u2019re doing significant amounts of renewal leasing. It\u2019s the most I think we\u2019ve ever done. Obviously, there\u2019s negotiations and the one thing I did mention in the prepared remarks is during the worst times, downturn where people had stated options in their lease instead of just renewing them, it seemed like every renewal was open for renegotiation. ","Now what we\u2019re seeing a lot more as kind of an increasing trend is that the retailers are willing to just go ahead and sign the stated option and move on because they know, as Hap mentioned, the amount of second generation spaces out there has gotten a lot smaller. ","Hap Stein","In general, if you think about it, Wes, if you\u2019ve got a successful business in a good shopping center in a good space in that shopping center, you\u2019re not going to want to relocate that business for a few bucks a foot. ","Wes Golladay \u2013 RBC  Capital Markets","Okay. Sticking with the shop space, I\u2019m trying to figure out when we can start pushing the rents. Would that be when you get to the 91% occupancy, so about 4% away? Is that what we\u2019re looking at?","Brian Smith ","It\u2019s really dependent on the market and the shopping center. We\u2019ve got it and we have significant pricing power in markets like the Pacific Northwest, in the San Francisco Bay area, Houston, Austin, and where we don\u2019t have any would be in Las Vegas, Arizona, Inland Empire and Central Valley, California. ","All the other ones, it\u2019s improving quite a bit as we\u2019re seeing fewer move outs, more leasing activity, and our occupancy growing and sales improving and margins improving on the retailers, we are getting better pricing power. ","Hap Stein","Unfortunately, we have limited exposure to those markets. ","Wes Golladay \u2013 RBC  Capital Markets","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. ","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Good morning, guys. Hap, if I could follow up on the question from Jim, do you think the development yields you earned before, the 8% to 9% yields are achievable if your shop space proportion might be a bit leaner than it was in the past? I\u2019d expect that shift in the mix of space could potentially clip your yield a little bit from what you might have earned in the past. Is that the case or do you disagree?","Brian Smith","It\u2019s true, but on one hand, there\u2019s not that much development going on. Where it\u2019s going on is typically more in the urban markets where there\u2019s better sales being generated for the retailers, so that\u2019s allowing them to keep their rents higher than you\u2019d expect. I mentioned the $48 rent in the Bay area. You\u2019re not going to get that in some of the markets that are greener and don\u2019t have -- be able to generate the top line revenue for the retailers. ","The other thing that\u2019s happening is construction costs are lower than they were at the peak. The cities are much more willing to work with you on fees because they\u2019re looking for the tax revenue, so you aren\u2019t getting feed out of the game. And then the land costs have come down in most markets, so while rents may have come down a little bit or you have less shop space, you also have a better top side.  ","Hap Stein","The bottom line is we\u2019d rather have a shopping center that makes a core shopping center infill market that makes set in stone long term, and if the return is eight or if it\u2019s eight or maybe a little below that, because we\u2019re phasing part of the side shop space, we\u2019d rather have that than a 10% return out in a shopping center that doesn\u2019t make sense doing long term. ","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Would that argue that the development pipeline as you approach in the next five to ten years is probably more infill than it was in the last five to ten?","Hap Stein","Absolutely.","","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","I guess another question, just maybe building on another earlier question, who is buying BNC Assets out there and how they\u2019re getting financed. Do you guys think lenders are loosening up on underwriting terms there or is that really not changed much?","Brian Smith","I can let Lisa and Bruce talk to the lending and the underwriting, but if you look at what we sold in this past quarter, every one of them except for one was sold to private buyers. What they are looking for and what they like, which was eluded to earlier, is the fact that most of these have no debt on them and therefore they can get very strong leveraged IRRs. ","Hap Stein","Financing must be available to stronger local regional and national private buyers. ","Bruce Johnson","My friends that are on the private side are still having difficulty arranging financing that they had been used to prior, even before the peak of the market. The underwriting requirements have changed significantly. You can get financing, but as Hap said, you\u2019ve got to be one of the stronger players in the markets you\u2019re dealing in. ","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Bruce, is there any chance to\u2014I\u2019m not sure if this exists, but to get assumable data on some of these and actually sell them off on a highly levered fashion, or is that just not permissible in the market today?","","Bruce Johnson ","That, again, would depend upon the strength of the player involved, I think. Certainly that\u2019s something that we could do and would do, and if you\u2019re a private guy and not a public company, I think if you\u2019ve got the relationships as well, you could do that, but again, all of those things are more difficult today. ","Brian Smith","As I look at the lists of the people who bought these private buyers, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s just one person deciding they\u2019d like to own a shopping center. Up in Washington we sold property to Merlone Geier. They\u2019ve been around forever. They have a large portfolio. They\u2019re private but they\u2019ve got a lot of endowment money behind them. Cole Capital is one of the ones that bought, so they typically are private but they\u2019re pretty well capitalized. ","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Last question. We actually just hosted a call last week with one of your competitors who called out Florida for its weakness, particularly in the small shop leasing front. I think it bottomed lower and it\u2019s turning, but still slowly. Can you guys talk specifically about what you\u2019re seeing in Florida, maybe for your portfolio but more broadly in the market?","    ","Brian Smith","If you had to look at one trend in our portfolio, it would be the recent strength in Florida. The unemployment rate has fallen in Florida. I think it\u2019s the second fastest improvement in the country and what we saw in the fourth quarter for the first time was real enthusiasm, real excitement. ","Down in Tampa, which has been a tough market, we had 15 new leases all commence on December 15th so there\u2019s a lot of optimism and there\u2019s a level of activity in Florida that we just haven\u2019t seen in a long, long time. ","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll follow up with you guys. ","","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. ","","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi everyone. Just a follow up on the disposition side, the BNC question. Private buyers are the ones buying the stuff last quarter, but can you just talk broadly about the demand you\u2019re seeing? Is that increasing of late or just holding steady? Falling?","","Hap Stein","It\u2019s holding steady, I\u2019d say. Executing on the sale of non-core properties, the properties that we\u2019re selling, there is demand but it isn\u2019t like the demand for the A centers. ","","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, but it hasn\u2019t fallen off at all?","Hap Stein","No, it has not. As a matter of fact, I think the stuff we\u2019re selling is still for the most part is pretty decent. It\u2019s good stuff and we just think the capital could be better utilized elsewhere as far as improving our growth profile. ","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then a cleanup question. I noticed that TI\u2019s this quarter looked like they ticked up a little bit higher than they\u2019ve been trending on a per year basis. Was there just a couple transactions that skewed that higher?","Brian Smith","There\u2019s some of that. The reality is if you look at the trend in TI\u2019s since 2009 it\u2019s been on a downward trend. This quarter ticked up a little bit, but I think it\u2019s a one quarter kind of deal and it doesn\u2019t signify anything else. ","We also were giving TI\u2019s a little bit more often so it\u2019s not -- for example, on the renewals, our per square foot TI amount actually dropped, it\u2019s just that we gave a little bit more often than in the past. There were several retailers or users that are big high TI demand. ","We had a lot of medical, whether it\u2019s dentists or hospital urgent care kind of concepts, Petco, which has a big electrical requirement, Office Depot is the same kind of thing, so there was a lot of that.

Could you talk about the timing and the trajectory of same store NOI growth this year based on your expectations of what the changes and lease percentage and physical occupancy is going to be? Also, just one beyond that, as well. What are the drivers that you think would get you to the lower end of your 1.5% to 3% same store growth guidance versus the upper end? ","Lisa Palmer","I\u2019ll take the first part of the question. I\u2019ll let Brian answer the drivers of the growth of the low end and the high end. From the trajectory standpoint, clearly it\u2019s going to be on an incline, an upward incline with the first quarter probably being more in the range of 1% to 2%, and then you\u2019d see improvements to that each quarter throughout the year. That would then get us to the 1.5% to 3% rate. ","Brian Smith","You have the contractual rent increases in the 1% to 1.5%. That\u2019s going to be pretty well set and it\u2019s going to depend on what\u2019s continuing to happen with move outs and leasing, and if the trends continue, it\u2019ll be as Lisa described. ","","[Semi Farique] \u2013 ISI","Okay, great. And I guess just one more. DDR announced a program where they\u2019re going to work with Score and the SBA and provide sort of favorable terms to entrepreneurs and potential small business tenants in the Atlanta area right now. Are you working on something similar? Do you think that\u2019s a need or something as a supplement to help boost some small shop growth and small shop leasing and maybe some of those tougher areas that you\u2019ve had? ","Hap Stein","We\u2019ve had conversations with our banks in the past and have offered that up, but when you really get right down to it, most of the demand from tenants, they have financing available, the right tenants, and we just haven\u2019t to date found a program like that that would make sense. Financing, I don\u2019t think is an impediment to us getting 94%, hopefully, by the end of the year, and 95% by the end of next year. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors. ","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Just going back to the small shop demand, you talked about Florida being an area of strength lately. Where else do you see outside demand and where else do you see a softening or leveling off of demand? ","","Hap Stein","I think it\u2019s more noticeable meaningful improvement from where we\u2019ve been would be the way I would describe that as. It\u2019s moving very encouragingly in the right direction. ","Brian Smith","Again, that\u2019s been the area of biggest change, which is really what I was trying to address. I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s changed. We\u2019ve had a great year of leasing throughout the year. It\u2019s just been off the charts and that\u2019s been widespread with the exception of just those few markets that we\u2019ve always talked about and they continue to remain weak. ","I think some of the other trends with regard to both the anchors and the small shop leasing would be we are starting to see an increased move toward quality as tenants\u2019 leases expire. We had a situation in Portland where Bed, Bath and Beyond moved less than a mile to come into our shopping center. We had Beverages and More move out of Westfield power center in San Diego to be where the daily draw of the grocery-anchored center is in one of our centers. ","I would say also up in the northeast, we saw 125 basis point increase in occupancy and that was despite the move outs of Borders, A&P and Blockbuster, which hit that region particularly hard.","The other thing, I think, going on with them is that these move outs, as low as they were, a lot of them are done on a strategic basis. It\u2019s either to get them out to make room for redevelopment, it\u2019s to expand another user, so I think those are a lot of interesting positive trends that are going on with small shops throughout the country. ","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Okay, and just going back to dispositions and thinking about non-core assets, what percentage of your portfolio do you think you would like to sell over the next four to five years in terms of the assets you consider to not have the kind of growth prospects that you would typically expect from your new acquisitions? ","Brian Smith","We\u2019ll focus on 10% but I do think the capital recycling will be an ongoing part of our strategy for the foreseeable future. ","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Okay, so if you look out four or five years you\u2019d probably sell about 10% of your portfolio during that period?  ","Brian Smith ","Based upon the guidance that we gave on Investor Day, that 10% of the portfolio would be sold in the two- to three-year period rather than -- I think a range of $150 million to $250 million. That would occur over a three-year period. ","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Chris Lucas with Robert W. Baird. ","Chris Lucas - Robert Baird","Good morning, everyone. Brian, just a question, another one, on the small shop space. It sounds to me like most of the work you\u2019re doing there is through the PCI program or with those type tenants. Is that fair?","Brian Smith","It is, yeah. ","Chris Lucas - Robert Baird","Okay, so the question is are you seeing any change in the makeup between corporate stores and franchisee stores? ","Brian Smith","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s some dramatic change. The only thing that we\u2019re seeing is you\u2019ve got some franchise concepts where you\u2019ve got a weak program, you\u2019ve got weak local franchisees and we just tend to avoid those, but I don\u2019t think on any macro level there\u2019s much of a change there. ","Chris Lucas - Robert Baird","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. ","Operator","We have a question from Philip Martin with Morningstar. ","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning, everybody. I promise I won\u2019t lead with a small shop question, but with respect to your capital recycling program, what is the average Regency holding period of these assets within your capital recycling program? How long have you held these assets? ","","Hap Stein","We\u2019d have to get back to you on that. It varies meaningfully. ","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. That would be helpful. I\u2019m just trying to gauge the average hold time of these assets. Secondly, with respect to small shop space, are you seeing an increase in new concepts or are these existing concepts, as you mentioned, maybe moving around, shifting around more strategically, et cetera, or given the unemployment issues that are out there, are you seeing more new concepts being started up and driving an incrementally higher small shop demand?","Brian Smith","We\u2019re seeing some new concepts. We always see new concepts in the restaurant category \u2013 the yogurts, the burgers. You see things like Petco\u2019s Unleashed, which is an expansion of a concept that they already have. We have heard of some other ones. There\u2019s a new one out there called The Joint, which is a chiropractic place. ","Again, I think in all the years I\u2019ve been doing retail, there\u2019s always new concepts coming out and I think that\u2019s continuing to go on, but it\u2019s not the new ones that are driving all the growth. ","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, and you\u2019re not seeing a disproportionate of new concepts relative to the past? It\u2019s about the same? ","Brian Smith","Yes. ","Philip Martin \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thank you very much. ","Operator","That is the last question we have today. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Stein for any closing remarks. ","Hap Stein","We appreciate your time and interest in Regency and hope that you have a great week and a great Super Bowl weekend. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. ","","",""]}}
