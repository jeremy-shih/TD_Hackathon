During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 19, 2015.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, currently our Chief Financial Officer who has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer effective September 1st; and Cathy Smith, who is the named Chief Financial Officer effective September 1st.","This morning, Brian will discuss our second quarter performance including results across our merchandise category and plans for the third quarter and remainder of the year, then Cathy will provide her perspective as she prepares to join the team as Chief Financial Officer next month, and finally, John will offer more detail on our second quarter financial performance and discuss our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Following the remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release which is posted on our Investor Relations Web site.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his perspective on our second quarter performance. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John and good morning to all of you. We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results which we announced earlier this morning. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.22 is 20.6% higher than last year and $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter.","We are also pleased that once again this quarter we were able to grow traffic and sales both in stores and in digital channels, even as we were cycling over a very promotional second quarter from last year. Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our expectations. Notably about two thirds of this comp increase was driven by a growth in traffic combined with the smaller increase in average ticket.","Second quarter digital sales grew 30% from a year ago slightly below our expectations as we compared against very intense digital channel promotions last year. Digital growth contributed about 60 basis points to our comp sales growth this quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was a half a percent point higher than last year. As we continue to benefit from favorable merchandise mix and the comparison over last year\u2019s promotional markdowns. On the SG&A expense line we had an unexpectedly strong quarter as we benefited from discipline throughout the organization along with the impact of expense timing as John will cover in a few minutes. With these results we continue to benefit from very strong cash generation by our core business which enabled us to return a combined $1 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchase.","As we\u2019ve outlined in last several quarters we\u2019re working to define clear roles for each of our merchandise categories and avoiding resources to growing what we call our signature categories; style, which includes the majority of apparel, home and beauty categories along with baby, kids and wellness. While we are still in the early days of this work we\u2019re already seeing a compelling benefit from our efforts. Specifically comp sales in signature categories grew more than 7% in the second quarter, three times our overall comp growth. This performance represents an acceleration from the first quarter when comp growth and signature categories was about doubled Target's overall comp growth.","With strong signature categories performance comps in both Home and Apparel were in the 4% to 5% range this quarter. In Apparel, results were strongest in Baby and Kids along with women's ready-to-wear. Within Home, results were strongest in the core and seasonal including back-to-school. Other categories highlights this quarter included toys part of our Kids focus in hardlines, which saw more than a 12% increase in comp sales. This growth helped offset comps decline in Electronics which is a primary beneficiary of the second quarter promotions last year and we were also seeing soft sales in tablets. Outside out stores, our focus on style was evident as more than 80% of our second quarter digital channel sales growth was driven by Home and Apparel. In Home where digital penetration is much higher than average, digital channel growth have of our total comp this quarter.","Looking ahead we'll continue to work to advance the key strategic priorities we laid out last fall. First on our list is to become a leader in digital, this is critically important because guest research shows that digital relevance drives traffic and engagement across all selling channels. While we're pleased with the industry leading growth we've seen so far this year we have much more work to do and a key asset will deploy is our source. We're already shipping digital orders from approximately 140 stores and by the end of this year we'll be shipping for more than 450 locations.","Ship-from-store capabilities allows us to balance inventory across the network, leverage the capital and labor already in our stores and reach guest more quickly. To highlight the benefits in improved shipping times, this fall we'll begin testing what we're calling available-to-promise in which we'll the guest a specific delivery commitment typically 2 or 3 business days. If the guest orders on a specific date, we believe this capability will drive further increases in digital conversion rates which are already improving rapidly as guest respond to a faster and firmer delivery commitment.","Second on the list of key priorities is working on category roles, beyond our efforts to grow signature categories, we're also focused on testing and learning how we can reposition our food offerings to better serve our guests. While this work won't be complete until next year we're engaged in many small tests throughout the country to gain a deeper understanding of our how guest would respond to potential changes in assortment and presentation. Through guest research, we already know we need to be more clearly highlighting Wellness in our food offering through both assortment and the information we provide. We're also focused on ways to elevate our food presentation and experience to fit the way the guests live and shop.","We know we have an opportunity to provide fresh healthy options and more relevant and localized assortment as our guests responding to healthy choices we're offering today. Within food our market share in Wellness is already doubled our food share overall and this quarter we continue to see double digit sales growth in these important categories. This clearly shows that our guests are already responding when we enhance assortment of natural, organic and better-for-you items in our stores. As a result in the third quarter we'll continue to expand our Wellness assortment in food with new food items in our made to matter collection and nearly 50 new items across 6 categories in our simply balanced brand.","Our third priority is to develop capabilities to offer more localized experiences across our stores and a more personalized digital experience for our guests. While this work is ongoing we're already seeing encouraging signs of the early progress on both fronts. To inform our localization efforts we launched a small test in the Chicago market where we're working with a set of stores to test changes to assortment, presentation and inventory commitments on certain items. In these stores we're highlighting locally relevant items, updating category adjacencies and changing shelf facings to reflect the demographics around these individual stores.","While this test is still early we're encouraged with the guest response so far specifically comp performance in this group of test stores has been 1 to 2 points higher than the rest of the Chicago market and a set of controlled stores. Items featured in the tests are present in 5% to 10% of the guest baskets in these stores and we've seen a meaningful improvement in our guest survey stores for variety of products in these stores. Giving these strong initial results we're working to quickly build on our capabilities and create an operating model that allows us to scale our efforts across a broader set of stores and demographic clusters.","As part of our personalization efforts last year we replaced the third party recommendation engine with internally developed product which incorporates both in-store and online guest history. In 2015, we've expanded the use of engine across our mobile offerings, email, subscriptions and cartwheel. This engine is driving a meaningful increase in conversion compared with our results on the prior third-party product generating incremental sales of $50 million to $100 million so far this year. We've rolled out personalization recommendations to Cartwheel only a few weeks ago but early data indicates the change is driving more than a 10% increase in the number of offers downloaded per user, a critical co-measure of engagement with this app.","Our fourth priority is to test and roll out new, more flexible format in markets where populations are increasing, guest affinity for Target is high and our store penetration is low. This quarter we were very excited to open a new City Target store in Boston literally next door to Fenway Park. And we're pleased with the look and feel of the store and the positive response we've seen from our neighbors. We began work on develop the store a decade ago well before we had smaller formats and for this project we're able to open a full sized store in a dense urban area. However this opening begs a question of the criteria we're using to designate stores as City Targets, a Target Express or simply Target. As a result we announced last month that going forward we will no longer use the City Target or Target Express names on any of these new stores. This announcement doesn't reflect a change in our desire to open stores in urban areas. It simply reflects our goal to become flexible and how we fit into every community with an ability to open up a variety of stores, different sizes and layouts, offer a locally relevant assortment and provide guests with easy access to items from our entire digital assortment through in store pickup.","Our fifth and final priority is to advance our growth initiatives by changing the way we work and becoming a more effective and agile organization. This week we announced several changes to our team including John's promotion to the newly created Chief Operating Officer role and the hiring of Cathy Smith as our new Chief Financial Officer. I am very excited about these changes and confident that John and Cathy will play a critical role in Target's long term success. In the past year I developed a deep appreciation of John's knowledge and insight. And I believe he is the right person to improve our operations. Retail is changing rapidly today than any time in my career and we need to ensure that core operations keep pace with the new ways we're serving the guests. Overtime Target has developed an incredibly complex supply chain, built to serve an outdated linear model in which product flows from vendors through distribution centers to stores. To serve guests today we are becoming much more flexible in a way we fulfill demand for products and services. And this is stretching our supply chain well beyond its core capabilities.","And frankly, as a result some retail fundamentals have started to suffer. Specifically in stocks in our stores have been unacceptable so far this year. And our guests deserve better. In this new role I've asked John to focus first and foremost on improving the capabilities of our supply chain, working across organizational boundaries to understand and address root causes that are hampering day to day execution. Beyond these immediate needs I've asked John to continually assess and evolve our capabilities to ensure our operations keep up with our strategy and a rapidly evolving retail landscape. As we plan to move John into this critical Chief Operating Officer role it was really important to me that we hired a Chief Financial Officer who is a proven leader. Someone capable of upholding Target's strong track record of disciplined financial management. So I'm very excited that we've convinced Cathy Smith to join our leadership team. She served as a CFO at other large organizations including Wal-Mart where Cathy and I were colleagues.","I have the utmost confidence in Cathy as a strong financial and business leader. She'll be an outstanding addition to our leadership team and John and I look forward to supporting her transition into this role. One year ago I was only a week into my new position when I spoke on this earnings call. As I look back at the last year I am very pleased with our progress and confident we're focused on the right strategic priorities because our guests are responding. As we plan for this year we face the daunting challenge of sustaining traffic and sales without repeating last year's promotional intensity. So far this year traffic and sales are increasing, digital growth is far ahead of the industry and signature categories are leading the way, yet we will not slowdown.","We'll continue to invest in newness, innovation and presentation while we focus on maintaining strong execution. We're seeing encouraging results in back to school, and back to college and we'll work hard to maintain that momentum for the rest of the season. Also this quarter we're excited about our new planned program including more than 50 items from our latest design partner Adam Lippes, beyond Adam's design our planned takeover will feature 100s of other products across a broad set of categories. Beyond apparel, accessories, home and pets you'll find planned soda bottles, shampoo, bandages, paper towels and more. We\u2019re pleased with the early reaction and the media buzz and looking forward to rolling out these items throughout the quarter.","Target is also featured permanently in the September issue of Vogue which includes a 21 page insert where we\u2019ve re-imagined some of the most iconic covers by incorporating products we sell. This insert will be digitally shoppable so our guests can go behind the scenes to buy what they see and access additional content. And while that becoming even more important in the fourth quarter we\u2019re already ramping up our support around this year\u2019s hot license products for kids both young and old. For Minions to Marvel, Avengers to Peanuts and of course Star Wars. These licenses are prominent in our assortment of back-to-school backpacks and this fall we will feature them on Halloween costumes, d\u00e9cor, apparel, toys and much more.","Before I end my remarks I want to pause and thank the Target team including the colleagues I met on my recent trip to India who are doing amazing work in sourcing and technology to support our strategic growth priorities. For our team members around the world this has already been a very eventful year and we made changes to our team and our structure to better support our guests. Throughout all these changes the team has remained resilient and energetic where the passion to serve our guest is contiguous. Every day I step back and marvel at the amazing things this team can deliver, iconic marketing, amazing products at an incredible price, fast and easy digital experiences and of course a unique store experience that brings our expect more pay less promise to life every day. None of this would be possible without our great team. And the outstanding results we\u2019ve seen so far this year are a testament to their efforts. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Cathy Smith. Cathy won\u2019t officially begin her role until September 1st but I\u2019m pleased that she is here today to introduce herself and share a few thoughts about Target and her new role. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. Like Brian I have long admired Target as a retailer and an iconic brand and a great American company. During my career I\u2019ve had the opportunity to view Target through the lens of a competitor and of course a guest. And now I am really excited and humbled to have the opportunity to join the team as we work to transform how we serve guests while preserving what consumers love about this brand. While I won\u2019t start working here until next month I\u2019ve really enjoyed getting to know the leadership team and I have had the opportunity to meet with many of the members of the finance team this week.","Target\u2019s success comes from many things beyond the iconic brand the company has an impressive array of owned and exclusive brands as a guest and someone who loves retail I\u2019m constantly impressed by Target\u2019s ability to delivery new, trendy, high quality items at amazingly low prices and I just know there are incredible product design developed and sourcing teams behind those items. In addition in appreciate that Target has just added 1,800 well maintained great looking stores in convenient locations delivering a great shopping experience and near and dear to every CFO\u2019s hearts we have a healthy balance sheet which when combined with our strong cash flow generation creates ample capacity to fund robust investments in growth and the return of billions of dollars to shareholders annually through dividend and share repurchases. And lastly Target has its passionate team members who work tirelessly to serve our guests every day and who are proud of their Target.","Let me tell you a brief story, as I was exploring the possibility of joining this amazing company I wanted to move beyond the familiar experience of shopping at my Target so I dedicated a couple of weeks to visit more than 65 stores across 10 states and I drove my family along for most of the ride. I spoke to guests at every store I visited and I can tell you that they are clearly demanding enthusiasts they love Target and they enjoyed sharing their personal stories about why they chose to shop with us.","Before I close I want to say that I\u2019m looking forward to reconnecting with those of you I know and getting to know those of you I don\u2019t. I plan to scale my first few months with the team amercing myself in the business to ensure I have a detailed understanding of where we\u2019ve been, where we are today and where we need to go in the future. With that foundation I look forward to meeting you and hearing your perspective. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to John who will share his insights on our second quarter, financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter and beyond. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Cathy and hello everyone. We\u2019re really pleased with our second quarter results as virtually every line on the P&L came in at or better than our expectations. Compared with our guidance going into the quarter overall comparable sales were in line with expectations, but the mix of store sales was a bit stronger than expected. Second quarter gross margin performance also met our expectations, but SG&A expense performance was much better than planned reflecting our continued efforts to control costs along with the impact of a timing change in marketing expense. As a result our second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.22, $0.08 above the high end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter.","Second quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.21, $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS as pretax restructuring costs and breach related expenses were 1 penny each were partially offset by $0.01 benefit from the favorable resolution of income tax matters. Second quarter GAAP EPS of $1.18 reflects a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.25 loss on Canadian operations last year. This year's Canada losses were consistent with our expectations as an increase in our accrual for estimated probable losses primarily guarantee of leases was offset by an adjustment to the tax benefit from the Company's investment loss in Canada.","Our second quarter comparable sales increase of 2.4% was just ahead of our first quarter performance and consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. Within the quarter, comps were strongest in May and June however this year's monthly pattern was the mirror image of last year's second quarter when the comp growth was strongest in July, which featured the most intense promotions in the quarter. As a result on a two year basis, monthly comp trends were very consistent throughout the quarter. Importantly, transactions were positive both in-stores and online throughout the quarter driving two-thirds of our comparable sales growth. Digital channel sales increased 30% in the second quarter on top of more than 30% growth in the second quarter last year. As Brian mentioned, second quarter 2014 was intensely promotional and those promotions were a key driver of digital channel sales last year.","Looking ahead, we'll continue to focus on achieving our digital channel sales goals through a combination of both traffic growth and conversion improvement. REDcard penetration was 22.1% in the second quarter more than 130 basis points ahead of last year. Portfolio delinquency and write off metrics are at historically low levels and we continue to see increase in payment rates. This means the size of the portfolio continues to slowly decline but better than expected risk metrics are offsetting this impact. As a result profit sharing income on the portfolio was up this quarter compared to last year.","One other note, this week we began accepting EMV or chip-card transactions at all stores across the country. As a result this quarter we will initiate the process of replacing all of our REDcard products with chip and pin cards including our private label credit and debit products. While sales were in line with expectations, our second quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.9% was much stronger than expected. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.9% was half a point higher than a year ago right on our guidance.","Consistent with the first quarter this year rate benefited from lower marked downs as we annualized last year's post breach promotional activity and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature categories. I mentioned this last quarter but I want to emphasize it once again, it is really important that we've been able to grow our traffic in sales even as we cycle over very intense promotions last year. Beyond the benefit of growing sales there was a compelling gross margin benefit from growing our signature categories three times as fast as the Company which more than offsets the pressure on our cost to goods from investments in quality, innovation and presentation.","On the SG&A expense line we had a standout quarter with a rate improvement of about 60 basis points compared with last year. This performance was driven by outstanding discipline across the enterprise combined with the benefit of our cost control initiatives. These benefits more than offset a 40 basis point headwind from incentive compensation which was unusually low in the second quarter 2014 in light of the financial performance we were experiencing at the time.","As I noted earlier, marketing expense timing was a meaningful benefit this quarter. As last year\u2019s second quarter spending was unusually high to support our promotions and this year we've retimed some spending into the third quarter in support of our back-to-school licenses and Target style. This timing shift benefited our second quarter SG&A rate by about 30 basis points or about half our overall rate favorability and we expect this shift will reverse in the third quarter.","Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our quarter end inventory position which was about 4% above last year. This reflects a meaningful improvement from the 9% year-over-year increase we reported at the end of first quarter driven by issues at the west coast ports. While we've made a lot of progress in the second quarter the year-over-year increase is moderated even further so far in August. As our quarter end inventory supported back-to-school sales that moved into early August as a result of retiming of some tax-free holidays.","Bottom line we feel very good about overall inventory levels in relation to our sales plans; however, we have a big opportunity to improve in stock levels which I'll cover in a few minutes. One note, you'll see on the balance sheet that we've moved pharmacy inventory into the other current assets line in all periods reflecting the current status was held for sale pending the close of our transaction with CVS.","Moving to consolidated metrics, second quarter interest expense was $148 million flat to second quarter 2014 excluding last year's $285 million charge for early debt retirement, we paid second quarter dividends of $331 million, up 22% from last year and we invested in other $675 million to retire shares that adds up to a total of $1 billion return to our shareholders this quarter representing more than 130% of net income. Looking ahead with healthy business results and an ample cash position, we expect to have the capacity to continue to returning a meaningful amount of cash through both dividends and share repurchases within the limits of our current investment grade credit ratings. As anticipated given our continued desire to repurchase shares, in the second quarter our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. As of quarter end under this program we have retired more than 65 million shares at an average price of just over $67 a share for a total investment of about $4.4 billion. With the expansion of the program we expect that sufficient repurchase authority well into next year including any potential repurchase resulting from the proceeds of the CVS transaction.","Regarding that transaction things are continuing as expected as we work with CVS and regulators to advance the process of gaining approval for the sale. Given the uncertainty of potential timing for regulatory approval and the closing of the transaction the guidance we provide to-date does not reflect any expected impacts of the transaction which includes application of proceeds and removal of prescription sales, costs and assets from our financial statements. As I described last quarter this year we began reporting return on invested capital from continuing operations or ROIC because we believe it is an important metric in assessing the quality of our capital allocation decisions overtime. And as we covered in the financial community meeting in March our goal is to reach the mid teens or higher on this metric over the next five years.","Not surprisingly given our strong operating results we reported a meaningful improvement in trailing 12 month ROIC this quarter as it grew 2 full percentage points to 13.3% compared with 11.3% a year ago. Now let's move to our outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. In the third quarter we are cycling over stronger sales results from last year, both in stores and digital channels. And we expect the consumer competitive environment to remain choppy. As a result we are planning for a third quarter comparable sales increase of 1 to 2% including expected digital channel sales growth of about 30%. We expect our third quarter gross margin rate to increase 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year reflecting a continued mix from the signature category sales and a benefit from cycling last year's promotional activity, partially offset by investments in quality and price on our owned and exclusive brand products.","On the SG&A expense line we expect our third quarter rate will be about flat to last year. As the benefit from cost control is expected to be offset by a 30 basis point headwind from the shift in marketing spend from Q2. Combining our gross margin and expense rate reductions we're looking for improvement in our third quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 to 30 basis points compared with last year. Third quarter interest expenses is expected to be approximately flat to last year and tax expense is expected to increase by about $60 million reflecting improved profitability and non-recurring favorable tax items in third quarter last year. Altogether these expectations would lead to third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.89, compared with $0.79 a year ago. Note that this includes the impact of the shift in marketing timings which translates to a $0.05 per share headwind in the third quarter.","As we look ahead to the full year we are certainly pleased with our results so far which have been notable stronger than expected and we have been pleased with comp performance so far this month, including back to school sales which reflected retiming of some tax free holidays into early August. At the same time we remain mindful of the intensely competitive nature of our holiday season and have noted the inventory levels we're seeing with some competitors. Taking both of those factors into account we're updating our guidance for the full year adjusted EPS to $4.60 to $4.75 a $0.10 increase compared with the prior range. Before I conclude my remarks, I want to pause and comment on my priorities as I enter the new role as Chief Operations Officer next month. As Brian mentioned, the number one priority for my new team is to improve the way our supply chain functions from end to end, achieving this goal, lead to many benefits perhaps the most visible of which is an improvement in our in stocks. Given the breadth and complexity of our business it will always be a challenge to the in stock on every item in every store in every moment of every day.","But our guests need us to be consistent in delivering everyday essentials and unfortunately in the last couple of quarters our in stocks have been deteriorating. This challenge is understandable because we've been asking our supply chain to move well beyond its original design and become more flexible in the way we serve our guests. However while we understand the reasons the simple fact is that our current performance is unacceptable. So beginning this quarter my team will be looking for both quick and more comprehensive solutions to make improvements in the supply chain both this year and overtime, and beyond this initial effort we will work to ensure that our preparations and strategy move in lock steps enabling us to serve our guests in a rapidly evolving retail landscape. I look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming months and years. With that we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Cathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen","Brian as you\u2019ve been so successful in this journey as traffics back to the stores, just a bigger picture question, how do you think your priorities have kind of dynamically changed throughout the year and where would you say Target is in terms of customers coming back to the store versus increasing customer spend? And John I had a question relating to the comp guidance as well.","Brian Cornell","Oliver, overall I think we\u2019re making really good progress against our key strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about for a year now. The change we announced this week is to make sure that we elevate our focus on execution and really ensuring operational excellence throughout the organization. And that is why I am so excited about John stepping into this new role to make sure that we complement the focus we have placed upon creating strategic clarity with a recommitment to operational execution. And I think the combination of those two elements is critical to continuing to drive traffic, make sure we delight the guest, seeing improvement in our net promoter scores and make sure that both in-store and online we are continuing to see an acceleration in traffic and visits to our site. So I think we\u2019re making very good progress right now. I think that is showing up in the results we delivered this quarter but we\u2019re not satisfied and we know we\u2019ve got more work to do to ensure that we do meet the needs of the guest every time they shop and critically important in meeting those needs is to make sure that we provide a great in-store experience and dramatically improve our in stock conditions particularly around core essentials. So I think very good progress I think this is an excellent quarter where the entire team performed well but we know we\u2019ve got more work to do and we got to make sure both in-store and online we deliver a consistently great experience for the guest.","Oliver Chen","And John I just had a question on the comp guidance, would you expect this to be a pretty broken up between traffic or ticket or do you think it\u2019s going to be more traffic led and as you do embark on the opportunity in supply chain, what are you highlighting as your lower hanging fruit in terms of timing and I was just curious about the categories that you seen the most opportunity for when you think about further advancing your supply chain?","John Mulligan","Sure. On the comp guidance we don\u2019t breakout traffic and ticket but I\u2019ll tell you just from a business perspective we\u2019re very focused on driving traffic overtime ultimately we have to bring people in our stores, we need to bring people at our site on to mobile devices and so that\u2019s a key driver for us for our sales as we continue to move forward.","Related to the supply chain, there is the team has done a great job responding to the needs of the organization overtime to develop more flexible ways to meet the needs of our guests and really fulfill on demand shopping I think we are just at a point now where we need to step back and build broader capabilities across the entirety of the supply chain as we continue to expand the way we want to serve our guests. So there is not one particular area of the company or one particular part of the business that we\u2019re completely focused on absent I would tell you and as I said and you heard from Brian in-stocks are a key priority and in specifically being sure day-to-day in every store we\u2019re in-stock on essentials. That\u2019s a key priority for our guest. We hear it from them. It\u2019s a key focus for the team and we have teams working on improving those in-stocks across our essential categories to-date and that will be a focus as we go forward.","Brian Cornell","Oliver I can build on that because as we talk about improving our focus on operational and executional initiatives, now I go back to some conversations we\u2019ve had in the past. I actually believe we have the best team in retail. Our store operations Tina and her team do a sensational job. But one of the things that John will be focused on is ensuring we simply the work and we make it much easier for them to execute each day and take care of the guest. So we want to complement a very strong store leadership team that does a sensational job each and every day executing store by store by simplifying some of the work, by making sure that we push work upstream and allow them to focus even more on the store experience and the service we provide our guest.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.","Matt Nemer","First I was wondering to what extent you are using price to drive the 3x growth in signature categories, can you comment on what the growth and gross profit dollars for those categories has been like?","Brian Cornell","Yes Matt, I\u2019d tell you that the improvements we\u2019re seeing is really driven by mix and as we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ve invested heavily in ensuring we are on trend. We are bringing great quality to the guests. We\u2019re extenuating our position in key categories. We were really pleased during the quarter to see how well we connected with sub-cats like swim. We\u2019ve seen really strong performance in ready to ware and most recently a very positive response to the changes we made in denim, so the improvements we're seeing in those categories are really driven by great quality following the trend curves, bringing great style and fashion to our guest and it has not been driven by a reliance on pricing.","Matt Nemer","And then secondly, your comments regarding the supply chain being stretched I realized that the analysis is just starting or in the early days, but do you believe that there is a significant refinement required in the supply chain in terms of either DCs or FCs or something else?","Brian Cornell","No, Matt we are in a place where we have, we believe just great-great assets across the supply chain, great distribution centers, great upstream distribution centers, food distribution centers fulfillment centers and of course the stores. I think we've said over the past couple of years our focus of our investment has been supply chain and technology in support of becoming an on demand company that will continue to be the case. We're going to continue invest in technology and supply chain, but the physical asset side we feel really-really good about.","Matt Nemer","Okay that's great news and then if I could just sneak one more in, the early back-to-school strength and the marketing shift is that fully embedded into the Q3 comp guide?","Brian Cornell","It is and it would be and we're seeing a very positive start to back-to-school and back-to-college.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Schick with Stifel.","David Schick","Wondering if you could give us a few more examples concrete examples of how you are driving that localization success in Chicago categories or items and separately if you could talk a little bit about digital approach outside of your own platform so we've seen it and we've heard from you what you're doing and that's exacting and driving growth, but we've seen a little bit of your outreach to bloggers and how you're working with them if you could talk about the full view of how you're thinking about digital outside of the Target's headquarter that will be helpful as well? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Sure, David let me start with localization and as I said during the couple of calls, this is still a very nascent effort for us. We're in one market a handful of stores in Chicago, but we\u2019d really been focusing on a handful of areas where we recognize we need to change our assortment, change our presentation, be more relevant and really recognize the needs and the demographics of these local markets. So, there is a handful of categories I might list up one craft beer and really making sure that in a category like craft beer we have locally relevant items and we recognized that even in a market like Chicago those need to be tailored neighborhood by neighborhood. So we have looked at specialty foods. We have looked at categories like craft beer. We have looked at categories like patio and grills, and recognizing in that end the suburbs of Chicago, we can offer and should have in-store large patio sets five burner grills, but for our stores located in more of the urban neighborhoods of Chicago we need Easter tables and we need two burner grills because those guests are living in condos and apartments, they've got small patios and we need to make sure we tailor our assortment and our presentation to recognize their needs and to make sure we're more locally relevant.","So we're certainly seeing a lot of time looking at food and as we think about the food reinvention a lot of this is going to be driven by making sure we have locally relevant brands, those hometown favorites and also in broader categories like patio and furniture making sure that we're matching up our assortment in-store with the needs of that local guests. So a lot of additional work for us to do, but we're really pleased with the progress and I talked about 1 to 2 point lift versus the test and control stores adds a very important measure for us to continue to evaluate. And working with John and our merged team we'll be looking o rapidly rollout the learning from Chicago into other relevant markets.","From a digital standpoint David, obviously we continue to see really positive response to some of our efforts like cartwheel and cartwheel has now been downloaded over 18 million times. And every time I am in-stores I run into guests that have their smartphone in their hand and they're looking for their offers from cartwheel, but we also recognized that Target is a brand that is talked about in social media everyday thousands of times every day. So if you were to visit our headquarter here in Minneapolis just down the hall from my office we have what we call guest central, it is our guest command center where we're monitoring what people are talking about, what they're blogging about, how Target is being referenced in the news and we're making sure we're very engaged with those bloggers and making sure that we're in the discussion. So it's a very important part of how we think about the brand and making sure that we incorporate social into our overall brand development initiatives.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Looking forward to working with you guys in your new capacity as we move forward. The stock obviously was up a lot earlier today it has kind of rolled over and I think it's the sales line that people may be a little concerned about. The 1% to 2% guidance in the third quarter but also that we'll look out over time SG&A saves obviously tapered down and so as you look out to '16 and '17 getting the sales line moving is going to be more important here. I know Brian you pointed to some things like the signature categories but I was wondering what else gives you confidence, we actually have a lot of confidence because we got a focused group that stay in touch that people are really responding to what you guys are doing. But in your words what gives you the confidence we can see sales trend higher overtime?","Brian Cornell","I think it starts Scott with the reaction we've seen from the guests, at some of the changes we made in signature categories. And when I think about in today's marketplace apparel growing at 4% to 5%, the changes we've seen and the reaction we've seen from the guest to our home offering. The fact that within kids, toys growing this quarter at 12% and while again still in the early stages the reaction to some of the changes we're making in our food assortment. The reaction that guests is taking to made to matter and our wellness initiatives gives me a tremendous amount of confidence that as we continue to bring great design, fashion, quality and excitement to our signature categories and combine that with the opportunity to reinvent food to bring the right assortment that meets the needs of our guests, that to me is the magic to unlock sustainable sales growth to Target and make sure we're driving traffic to our stores, more visits to our site and it gets back fundamentally Scott, I believe we win and will continue to grow by combining a great store experience the convenience of allowing our guests to order online and pick up in our stores whenever they want and also be able to ship directly to their homes and using our stores as flexible fulfillment centers to make sure that response is a quick one. So I'm very optimistic about the future. I think you're starting to see that embedded in the results and the results in signature categories is very encouraging for us. We're getting great feedback from the guests. As I think about the third quarter we expect plan to be a really exciting initiative and the buzz that we're seeing already is really positive. So we've got work to do on food but when we reinvent food and get the assortment right there and improve the presentation I think that gives us all great confidence that we're going to continue to drive traffic to our stores and that's going to convert to really solid and sustainable comps.","Scott Mushkin","And maybe just, I hate to be the short term focus but the question I get all the time as we look at the fourth quarter, where you're going to be going over a pretty significant comp from last year. How should we think about that, I mean a lot of people look at stacks, you guys have good stacks, or how do you think we should start framing the fourth quarter maybe a thought there?","John Mulligan","I think we can all drive ourselves crazy doing two year, three year, five year stacks whatever you want, but in this case I do think the two year of stack is important. We've continued to see our two year stacks improve if you do last year's Q4 against the previous Q4 you know the average there is about or the number there is about a 1-3. So we expect to cycle past that this Q4 and we've seen putting our, putting the implied guidance you guys can do a rough number around that, putting that against last year's comp will be an acceleration of our two year stack and so we feel good about that and I think to the points Brian just made, part of it is we need to continue to grow, we feel confident we\u2019re going to continue to grow and comp against whatever it is we delivered in the prior year and we feel good about doing that, we feel great about our fourth quarter plans, we're cognizant that that's an intensely competitive time of year, we'll be very promotional, we're not going to get beat on promotions and we'll be in the game and we feel really good about what we'll offer the guests in Q4.","Brian Cornell","And Scott honestly, we'll update our guidance for the fourth quarter at a later date, but trust me we're spending a tremendous amount of time evaluating our plans week by week in the fourth quarter. I spent time just yesterday with our team going through our fourth quarter plans, our merchandizing plans, our marketing plans, how we\u2019re going to approach the key holiday periods. And to me it's all about making sure we've got the right content, we have got to have great product. We certainly know we need to make sure we're winning from a promotional standpoint but then we got to make sure we surround the guest with a great experience and really iconic marketing. And I think we're going to combine a great in store with an online experience and be very competitive and well prepared for the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock","I was just wondering if we could focus just, I know we focused on, you have talked a lot about the signature categories, you have talked a lot about supply chain but could we focus on, and you've also talked about food can you focus a little bit on electronics continued weakness there clearly the industry itself is a little bit challenged but a lot of consumer interest in new products in that category especially as we go into the holiday season this upcoming holiday season you\u2019re talking about the fourth quarter maybe dive a little bit into what you\u2019re doing there in that specific category to maybe try to gain market share and what is the challenge category? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Yes so Matt I\u2019m not going to go through the details of our plans. We\u2019ll kind of maintain that powder for the fourth quarter but we\u2019re certainly looking at newness in electronics. We\u2019re looking at categories where we think we\u2019re uniquely positioned to win, so working very closely with our suppliers to ensure that we have the right newness that we\u2019re ready with the right presentation I think there is a lot of exciting things in the pipeline. We certainly think as we continue to focus on wellness that variable technology is a space where we can and will win. But we also recognized right now that many of those categories are waiting for new innovation and we\u2019re working closely with our key suppliers to make sure that we\u2019re going to be bringing that innovation to the guest and featuring it throughout the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.","Peter Benedict","Two quick ones, first, on the digital side obviously impressive growth 30% I think the longer term plan closer to 40%, so curious, two things, one, what kind of gets that channel growing faster the next couple of years and related to that a number of large retailers out there are opening up dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers. I don\u2019t believe you guys have those, is that something that make sense for Target as you think out over the next few years?","John Mulligan","I\u2019ll take the second one first and then let Brian comment on the growth. I think on our supply chain for the digital channel we actually have six dedicated fulfillment centers and we think the combination of fulfillment centers with our exciting regional distribution centers and along with the stores gives us all of the capability we need and then you\u2019ll see us continue to grow the store channel, our regional distribution channel, all three of those channels as ways to fulfill depending on the product and how quickly the guest wants it.","Brian Cornell","Yes and Peter I\u2019ll step back and just talk about the fundamentals. We got to continue to make sure that we build awareness. We got to make sure that as our guest engages with us digitally we make it really easy, and we make it easy to find product and easy checkout experience. We believe that available to promise which will roll-out this fall will give our guest the confidence that they know where the product is and when it will arrive for them either in a store for them to pick up or being available directly to their home. So we\u2019re focused on making sure that we provide not only a great in-store but a great digital experience and we\u2019re going to make sure that we continue to make our site easy to work with and more and more that\u2019s the mobile interchange that we\u2019ve got to make sure is easy for our guest to find product and checkout. We want to give them the confidence that when they order they know it\u2019s available to promise and we\u2019re going to have it there for them when they need it. And to the point John made, we don\u2019t need to be building upstream DCs we\u2019re going to continue to convert more of our stores and as we go in the fourth quarter close to 450 that will act as flexible fulfillment centers to make sure that we can quickly and efficiently get product to the guest. So those fundamentals are critically important as we think about driving industry leading growth.","Peter Benedict","Sorry, my bad on the DC question, but thank you for that. And quickly over to SG&A I think you guys have outlined 1.5 billion over the next couple of years in savings $500 million maybe coming this year where are you trending towards those savings, how are those savings kind of corporate versus in-store I\u2019m just curious kind of how like store level payroll dollars compared today versus let\u2019s say a year ago?","John Mulligan","Yes so, we\u2019re right on track with the savings we\u2019ve got programs identified to deliver the entirety to 2 billion to 1.5 billion in SG&A plus the cost of good saving so we feel really good about that we\u2019re on track for our commitment for this year as well. One of the things we talked about when we had first announced this and we\u2019ve talked about it in a great detail and the company is -- the stores are already productive and if we\u2019re going to take hours out of the store it will be because we eliminate work to the point Brian made earlier move work upstream into the distribution centers. And so we\u2019re not focused on taking hours out of the store. We\u2019re focused on taking work out and we are in the process of working through that, that\u2019s a little bit longer lead process than some of the other things we\u2019ve done. But we\u2019re focused on essentially freeing up those hours in the store and then we\u2019ll decide do we need them for improved guest service or how we\u2019ll utilize them. But in fact we have -- there is a couple of areas where we have invested hours back into the store as we have put in the whole merchandising sets and as we have put in mannequins we\u2019ve realized the need for dedicated store team members who can merchandise those displays and make them look great all the time. So that\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve invested back into the store.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Gregory Melich","John I can\u2019t let you get promoted without hitting with a finance question so, how much the credit helped you said credit I think was a benefit in the quarter profit share how much did that help in the quarter and linked to that how should we think about SG&A dollar growth, I mean, it sounds like third quarter will be up 1 to 2 in the comp but it was flat in the second quarter, what's the normal run rate there now?","John Mulligan","Good question, on the credit side the benefit it was up but not meaningful and it was less than I would say less than half a penny of improvement versus last year so very-very small we are pleased it was up given that as we said payment rates continue to go up and so we're seeing the portfolio continue to shrink, so clearly a portion of where the gas dollars are going at least from our perspective. SG&A through time, we'd expect to lever SG&A go up over the long-term here go up modestly slower than sales growth. I think we said we're going to continue to take expense out, but we also said that the majority of that expense will likely get reinvested so I wouldn't count on big reductions in our SG&A overtime there will be places where we have to add back expense to meet the needs of our guests I just talked about in the stores. So modestly slower than sales growth over the long-term would be what I\u2019d say.","Brian Cornell","Okay, thank you. And for all you that concludes our second quarter earnings conference call. And I really appreciate you joining us today, so thank you."],"20448":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q1 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call May 23, 2018  8:00 AM ET","Executives","John Hulbert - VP, IR","Brian Cornell - Chairman and CEO","John Mulligan - EVP and COO","Mark Tritton - EVP and CMO","Cathy Smith - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Matthew McClintock - Barclays","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Edward Kelly - Wells Fargo","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse","Greg Melich - MoffettNathanson","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Chris Horvers - J.P.

During the presentation, all participants will be listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 23rd, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; Mark Triton, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark, and Cathy will provide their perspective on our first quarter performance, outlook for the full year, and progress on our long-term strategic initiatives. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.","As a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our first quarter performance and our priorities going forward. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks John and good morning everyone. We are really pleased with the performance of our business in the first quarter, which demonstrates the resilience of our multi-category portfolio.","Our traffic growth, up 3.7%, is the strongest we've seen in more than 10 years, reflecting healthy increases in both our stores and digital channels. Comparable sales growth of 3% was consistent with our guidance, driven by strength in home, household essentials and food & beverage.","This demonstrates the benefits of maintaining a balanced portfolio as strength in these categories offset the impact of a late spring on our temperature-sensitive categories, which have accelerated dramatically as we entered the second quarter. We also benefited this quarter from the launch of three new owned or exclusive brands in Home and apparel and a successful limited-time partnership with Hunter.","In our digital channels, we continue to see strong trends even as we compare over rapid growth in past years. For the first quarter, Target's digital channel sales grew 28%, on top of 21% a year ago.","While our operating income continues to reflect some near-term headwinds driven by last year's investments to transform our business, we are benefiting from accelerated traffic and sales and federal tax reform legislation enacted late last year. As a result, our earnings per share grew more than 9% in the first quarter and we're expecting strong EPS growth for the remainder of the year.","Given all the changes we've made in our business, we are seeing multiple drivers of the recent acceleration in our performance from our investments in stores, supply chain, new brands, and our team, even our ongoing partnership with CVS. Everything is contributing to our success and our guests are responding.","As a result, given our current trends and our plans going forward, we expect that our comparable sales growth will accelerate in the second quarter into the low to mid-single-digit range. And we remain confident that our business will generate full year sales and earnings per share consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.","As we have said many times, our business performs best when we support both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less brand promise. On the Pay Less side, we continue to see the benefit of last year's work to optimize assortment, focus on fundamentals, and ensure we are priced right daily.","And in support of the Expect More side of that promise, we're seeing great results from our investments to differentiate Target from everyone else in the marketplace. We have committed significant capital to remodel our stores, ensuring we continue to provide a great experience for our guests.","In the first quarter, we completed more than double the number of remodels we delivered a year ago. Beyond the direct feedback we're hearing from our guests, we continue to see incremental 2% to 4% sales lifts in stores following the completion of a remodel.","Beyond these wall-to-wall transformations, we continue to roll out presentation enhancements to a broader set of stores focused on key categories, like beauty, apparel, home and food & beverage.","And on the sales floor, we continue to invest in hours, tools, and training that will allow our team to provide our guests a richer experience as they walk our stores, pick up their digital orders at the front of the store or now, even in the parking lot.","Beyond our work in existing stores, we continue to expand the physical reach of our brand, rolling out new small formats in neighborhoods we didn't serve in the past. These stores serve as a beacon for our brand, reaching guests who have a high affinity for Target. And importantly, they continue to deliver outstanding sales productivity and compelling financial performance.","Beyond a price right assortment that addresses their needs and wants, convenience is a high priority for our consumers. As a result, we're rapidly rolling out services and capabilities designed to make Target America's easiest place to shop.","At the beginning of the year, we rolled out free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items on Target.com with no annual fee. We're able to make that commitment and control costs because over the last few years, we've developed the capacity to increasingly rely on our stores and serve as a shipping point for digital orders.","Beyond efficient fulfillment to our guest homes, we are rapidly rolling out our new Drive-Up service to stores across the country. With this service, we typically have orders ready within an hour. And when a guest parks at a designated area, our team delivers their order to the backseat or trunk of their car, usually within two minutes. Guests tell us they love the convenience this service provides and they're amazed at how easy it is.","Our rollout of same-day home delivery through Shipt is also expanding rapidly, reaching nearly half our stores by the end of the first quarter. Like Drive-Up, this service is receiving very high satisfaction ratings from our guests and we've been very pleased with the execution of the Shipt team as they rapidly scale up into new markets across the country.","While Shipt is our most common way to deliver same day, we're also rapidly rolling out a distinct version of same-day delivery to stores located in dense metro areas. With this service, guests fill their own basket but don't need to worry about carrying their items home. Instead, they pay a small fee to have their order delivered via courier later that same day in a time window of their choosing.","And finally, we also continue to expand our next-day delivery options for essentials, Target Restock. In the first quarter, we expanded this service nationwide and dropped our industry-leading delivery fee even further.","Beyond fulfillment, we continue to find ways to add digital capabilities that drive convenience in all channels. Last year, we integrated Cartwheel into our native Target app. And in the fourth quarter, we integrated REDcard into the app with a new wallet feature.","Now at checkout, with a simple scan of a bar code, a guest can redeem Cartwheel offers and redeem a gift card or pay with their REDcard and automatically save 5%. The scan is amazingly fast and easy and we've seen increasing adoption of wallet since the rollout.","With all this rapid change, our team is moving faster than ever before. At the same time, we need to execute on every task with excellence every day and our team is rising to that challenge.","To support our team in this rapidly changing environment, we are updating our operating model, providing them with new tools and training and allocating hours to support new fulfillment options and additional service on our sales floor.","Beyond these investments in the guest-facing portion of our stores, we are investing to transform our entire supply chain to support stores as they provide all of these new fulfillment options to our guests.","With this transformation, our team is implementing changes that will, over time, dramatically reduce store workload dedicated to replenishment, bringing up our store teams to focus on serving our guests.","To support the demands of the new fulfillment model and our distribution facilities, the team is testing and rolling out cutting-edge automation that will allow our DC teams to customize and sort each shipment to match the needs of an individual store, reducing store labor without creating the need to invest in new square footage in our upstream facilities.","None of these changes will be possible without the meaningful investments we're making across our business. And unlike many of our competitors, we have the financial capacity to fund these investments. Beyond CapEx, we're making additional investments to provide team members with new ways to grow and learn and to support our team as they do more and more for our guests and our business, we're taking a leading position on wages.","In the first quarter, we increased our national starting wage to $12 or more in support of a commitment to reach a $15 national minimum by the end of 2020. With these commitments, we're already seeing the benefit in our business as we ensure Target remains an employer of choice in a very tight market.","So, now I want to turn it over to John, who will provide details on the team's work to transform our supply chain, enhance the experience in our stores, and roll out fulfillment options across the country. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks Brian and good morning everybody. When you think about the work we're doing across the operations team, you quickly see that it's all about modernizing how we work, both our operating model and how we use our physical assets.","On the physical asset side, the good news is that we started with a strong base of well-designed, well-located, and well-maintained stores and distribution facilities, but they are optimized only for store shopping.","Similarly, we already have the best team in retail, but they were trained in routines and processes focused primarily on tasks and designed exclusively for guests who are shopping our stores.","Now, let me be clear. Store shopping remains very important and will continue to be so in the future, but it's no longer the only way people choose to shop. So, for both our physical assets and our people, we are modernizing how we work, which includes a meaningful investment to continue providing the best of what physical shopping means today. At the same time, we are reorganizing virtually everything we do to ensure we provide convenience, speed and reliability in all the ways that our guests want to shop.","Across our supply chain, we're testing and rolling out new processes designed to make us faster, more nimble, more accurate, and reliable. Last year, we told you about our new facility in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which provides a clean slate where you could develop and refine a completely new way to replenish stores, and the results have been impressive.","Out of stocks on items in the store served by the Perth Amboy facility have been running about 40% lower than our previous benchmark. These results were accomplished by applying a new inventory positioning logic, developed by our data and analytics team that allows us to send the right quantity in the right unit measure much faster than our other facilities.","While last year was about developing and testing these algorithms, this year is focused on beginning to scale up the physical movement of inventory. And by early next year, another 50 Target stores will be served by this new model.","Beyond processes at the DC level, we've also made changes at headquarters to optimize inventory allocations across our network. Last year, we created a new inventory management role in the supply chain team, focused entirely on item forecast accuracy and allocation.","This has led to an increased focus on inventory availability in our upstream facilities, which, historically, were associated with half of our out of stocks because the units simply were not in our network.","With this change, we've enhanced upstream safety stock, which allows us to replenish more quickly in response to accelerating sales. In addition, this change allows the merchandising team to focus more on strategic inventory investments to better position us to gain market share.","While we are still early in the process, we're already seeing the benefit in our business as our out of stock position is at historic lows and continuing to improve. While there's more work to be done, we're encouraged by the progress so far.","And while we're on the topic of inventory, I want to address our total inventory position at the end of the quarter, which reflects the strategic positioning I just mentioned. For example, our teams in toys and baby have increased their inventory investment to ensure that we can meet higher demand as other competitors liquidate and exit these categories.","We also ended the quarter a little heavier than expected in weather-sensitive categories, but that has already moderated as we've seen very strong sales in these categories so far in May.","And finally, this year's calendar shift resulted in some early back-to-school and back-to-college receipts being reflected in our first quarter, which weren't recognized until second quarter last year. Bottom-line, we feel very good about our inventory level, which positions us for accelerating growth and market share gains in the second quarter and beyond.","All of us, both at headquarters and in the field, are focused on serving our guests as quickly and efficiently as possible and we're placing our stores at the center of that effort. In the first quarter, more than two-thirds of our digital volume was fulfilled by our stores, up from about 50% last year.","Of that store fulfilled volume, store pickup continued to account for about 15 percentage points, while ship from store volume has grown to more than 50%. We have more than 1,400 stores shipping directly to guests' homes today, and we continue to retrofit store backrooms to enable additional capacity.","But there's much more to our efforts to expand our digital fulfillment capabilities and provide new, convenient options for our guests. In the first quarter, when we launched free two-day shipping on Target.com, we saw an immediate increase in the number of orders, basket size, units, and sales. The team continues to develop enhancements that will make us faster and extend the cutoff for two-day shipping until later in the day.","One of our newest services is Drive-Up, and we are rapidly rolling out this capability across the country. We added this service in more than 250 stores in the first quarter, and we'll expand into 300 more in the second quarter.","For the stores added in the first quarter, guest adoption is ramping up more quickly than we saw in our Twin Cities test last fall, and the net promoter score has climbed to 85 in recent weeks, the highest of any service we provide.","Also new is same-day delivery through Shipt, which is now available for more than 700 stores and 80 markets in 25 states. In the second quarter, we will launch in multiple markets in the Midwest, moving our total to nearly 1,000 stores.","By the holiday season, we expect to have this service available from a vast majority of our stores in well over 40 states. We are receiving really positive feedback on this service as well. As a result, other retailers continue to join the platform, which helps Shipt's gross merchandise volume reach approximately three times last year's volume in the first quarter.","In addition to Shipt, we continue to be pleased with the rollout of our other same-day delivery service in dense urban areas, which we refer to as from store same-day delivery. As Brian explained, this is a service in which guests shop the store, and we deliver their basket later in the day. We tested this service in five New York stores last year.","And based on the results, we've now rolled out this service to a total of 55 stores located in all five New York boroughs as well as Boston, Chicago, Washington, DC, and San Francisco. Guests build much bigger baskets when they use this service, and Home continues to be the leading category in these orders, accounting for more than half of the sales dollars.","And we continue to make guest-friendly improvements. In the first quarter, we simplified the fee structure in New York, moving from three rates to a flat $7 rate. Order volumes spiked by 75% in response to this change.","And speaking of guest-friendly improvements, last week, we announced a 40% price reduction in our next-day essentials delivery service, Target Restock. This service allows guests to shop from a selection of more than 35,000 food and essential items, which we pack into a shopping cart-sized box and deliver next day. The service is now nationwide, covering more than 75% of the U.S. population.","And we reduced the delivery fee from $4.99 to $2.99, and we offer it free for REDcard holders. And I should mention, as with two-day shipping, Drive-Up and from-store same-day delivery, we don't ask guests to pay an upfront annual fee to enjoy this service.","So, as you can see, we have a rapidly growing list of services that we're scaling across the chain, providing guests with a combination of convenient options, same-day, next-day, two-day, pickup, in-store shopping, and returns. That makes as unique in the marketplace.","And as I said, our stores are at the center of all of them. So, we're investing in tools and capabilities in our stores to ensure they can reliably fulfill in all these new ways.","But the front of store still matters as well, and we're in the middle of an unprecedented remodel plan to ensure we continue to provide a differentiated in-store experience, whether you're focused on a quick Target run or coming in, grabbing a Starbucks, and taking a more leisurely stroll around the sales floor.","We completed 56 remodels in the first quarter, and we've already launched well over 100 more that will be completed this quarter. Unlike the past, when we plan these remodels, we partner with the local store team to customize the remodel plan to fit the needs of the neighborhood where it is located and we know it's working.","We continue to see average incremental lifts within the 2% to 4% range we've modeled for these projects. These lifts are mostly driven by additional traffic as the new environment invites guests to visit more often.","And when guests visit, they find a team that's better trained and better equipped than ever before. Because we've rolled out training and ongoing product education, our guests are greeted by product experts in key areas like food & beverage, beauty, electronics, and apparel.","In addition, we've allocated more hours to key shopping times, like weekends, and around key seasons, like Mother's Day, back-to-school and back-to-college. We started to roll out these enhancements and measure the guest response, and we're happy with what we're seeing.","For example, we've seen better attachment rates and warranty sales in electronics as guests respond to the higher level of service and expertise they're finding there. We are in the early stages of making these changes and we will continue to monitor the guest response as we roll them out more broadly.","And we can't finish without covering the new stores we're opening around the country. We opened seven new locations in the first quarter, including one large-format location and six small formats in metro areas, like Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago.","We are really pleased with the financial performance of these new small format stores and even happier with how they grow. We have dozens of small formats that have been opened for more than a year and as a group, they continue to comp in high single-digits in the first quarter.","So, it's like Brian said, when we look at what's driving our traffic growth, we can't isolate a single driver. It's the combination of all the changes we've been making that have changed the trajectory. In fact, we continue to see the benefit of our 2015 sale of the pharmacy business to CVS as script counts in our store pharmacies increased 8% in the first quarter. While the progress feels great, we are not about to slow down. We have much more to accomplish this year, and the team is engaged and focused on delivering for our guests.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark, who will provide more detail on our first quarter performance and our upcoming plans in merchandising. Mark?","Mark Tritton","Thanks John. At Target, everything we're doing is focused on our guests. You see it in our work to elevate the guest experience as we invest in our teams and remodel our stores. You see it in our new small formats where we tailor the assortment to fit the needs of the neighborhood.","You see it in our work to deliver more convenience with a rapidly expanding menu of fulfillment options. And it's reflected in our work to modernize the supply chain where we are working to increase reliability and drive trust.","In merchandising, we focus on our guests by working to elevate their assortment, delivering the right balance of quality in owned brands with outstanding national brands. We differentiate Target by developing and curating new, innovative products and exciting new owned brands, which deliver an unbeatable combination of quality and price.","We elevate the key moments in the lives of our guests, including holidays and seasonal moments like back-to-school and back-to-college. And of course, we focus on value, ensuring our assortment is priced right daily while delivering clear, impactful promotions, and drive awareness through our marketing.","While there is much more ahead, I'm really pleased with the results our team is already delivering. In the first quarter, we launched 3 new owned or exclusive brands: Universal Thread in women's denim, apparel and accessories; Umbro in Kids and sporting goods; and Opal House in home. In addition, we delivered Hunter for Target, an exciting limited-time partnership with an iconic British brand and the guest reaction to all these new brands has been fantastic.","In terms of value, multiple metrics show that last year's efforts are continuing to drive results. Across our frequency categories, where we are seeing share growth, unit share continues to grow faster than dollar share, a positive leading indicator for our future results.","Already this year, regular price sales increased more than $1 billion compared with last year, reflecting the impact of our priced right daily strategy. And both quick trips and fill-in trips are growing faster at Target than the industry overall, something that's visible in our traffic and by traffic and basket performance.","Beyond these metrics, we see the benefit when we survey our guests about their perceptions of Target. In these surveys, we're receiving higher scores on convenience, reflecting the benefit of our work on fulfillment. We're also seeing rising scores on multiple measures of value, including our everyday pricing, having great sales, and delivering a great deal.","The data also shows we're getting high marks for our assortment across multiple dimensions, including the quality of our products, having the assortment that fits our guests' needs, being in stock, and delivering an assortment of trend right. Given all of these results, it's not surprising that Target's overall net promoter score has also been increasing, nor is it a surprise that we've seen an acceleration in guest traffic.","Our first quarter category results reinforce the value of our balanced category mix, which sustained our traffic before warmer weather arrived. And it's clear that warm weather affects the timing of sales in some of our temperature-sensitive categories, including multiple parts of Apparel as well as outdoor living in home, sporting goods in Hardlines and sun care in essentials.","In these categories, which accounted for nearly 10% of our first quarter sales, while we saw very strong growth in normal or positive temperature regions, our overall average comps were generally lower than the rest of our total assortment.","However, we saw a dramatic uptick in sales and demand as weather warmed in late April into May when overall traffic accelerated and temperature-sensitive items began out comping the rest of our assortment.","Drilling into the first quarter performance of our 5 core merchandising categories, home led the company with a mid-single-digit comp in the first quarter. This reflected broad strength, which offset the impact of delayed sales in season categories, in particular strength in owned brands with the launch of Opal House.","Essentials and beauty also had a strong quarter, growing well over the company average. Our beauty area continues to benefit from our work to differentiate Target assortment, especially in areas focused on naturals and diversity in beauty, hair and body care. This is further elevated when combined with the impact of new presentation enhancements and our investment in training to increase product expertise in our stores.","Beyond beauty, in essentials, we're seeing the continued benefit of our focused pricing and promotions work, punctuated by our Target Run and Done marketing campaign, which together are driving the trip gains I mentioned earlier.","In food & beverage, we saw our fifth consecutive quarter accelerating growth as our first quarter comp increase was in line with the company average. This performance reflects our work on pricing and promotions, assortment, presentation, and our focus on the fundamentals.","Consistent with prior quarters, first quarter comps were strongest in our beverage and produce categories. In addition, we saw really strong performance around the Valentine's Day and Easter holiday, driven by strong growth in seasonal candy and floral.","Both apparel and Hardlines comped positive but below the company average in the first quarter. In apparel, which comped slightly below the company average, strength in our new brands and our positive ongoing efforts in men's offset the impact of the late spring on temperature-sensitive items. As a result, we saw positive market share gains in yet another quarter.","A key standout was our Baby business, which has returned to strong growth this year. Given that having a baby is a key life moment, we have long had a focus on making life easier for new parents, and we're upping our game as others exit this space. We've done a lot of work on our assortment, quality, value and baby registry. And this year, we are seeing the broad benefits in our results, particularly in our infant basics area.","In Hardlines, despite the near-term pressure caused by heavy liquidation pricing from competitors in the marketplace, we saw the strongest growth in toys, which offset softer performance elsewhere in the category, including electronics, where we're comping out of the very successful launch of Nintendo Switch a year ago.","In the second quarter, we'll maintain our focus on newness and innovation as we continue to drive guest preference for Target. Just last week, we announced that we have partnered with Disney to launch an exclusive collection of more than 350 items in apparel, toys, bedding, beauty, food, even pet treats, all inspired by the unmistakable style and silhouette of Mickey Mouse, who happens to be celebrating his 90th birthday this year. This collection celebrates Mickey and the Magic of Summer in a distinctly Target way, and we will be featuring these items in both stores and Target.com all summer long.","Just earlier this week, we announced that we are collaborating with the Museum of Ice Cream to bring its fun and innovative style to our kids department, our freezer aisles and more. Once our team had visited the whimsical museum in New York, we knew we wanted to work with them to bring a little of their magic to Target guests.","Beginning June 3rd, our art class kids owned brand will feature a limited-time collection of summery colors, prints and patterns highlighting the museum's signature playful aesthetic. And later in the quarter, we'll be the first retailer to sell seven premium ice cream flavors developed by the museum, including two of the museum's classics and five brand-new and exclusive flavors.","And as we gear up to announce the specifics, we're planning to launch an additional four new owned brands later in the quarter. The first three will be focused on the Gen Z and millennial guests, bringing great Target style and value to all genders in multiple categories, such as apparel, accessories, shoes, and some exciting new areas.","The fourth brand launch for the quarter will be in home, playing to our great style credentials and Expect More. Pay Less brand promise. This new brand will have relevance for all guests, but it's not a coincidence that we'll be launching just in time for the all-important back-to-college season. Also, while I can't share more right now, there's more in store for the rest of the year and I look forward to sharing those details with you soon.","And finally, I want to add to John's comments on inventory. As he mentioned, we've been making some strategic investments in additional inventory as others are liquidating key categories that already represent core sales and market share strengths for us.","For the remainder of the year, as other competitors close stores and exit businesses, we will use our inventory and marketing to remind consumers that we have a compelling assortment in these businesses. And in many cases, our guests will see our assortment presented in a newly remodeled store at the same time that the other stores are closing.","In addition to our guests, we're also reaching out to our vendors, reminding them that Target is healthy, we're investing and growing, and we're eager to partner with them to launch exclusive items and content, helping them to grow their brand and develop a deeper relationship with the Target guests. Even though we're already seeing a lot of momentum, we see a lot more opportunity ahead of us and we are not slowing down.","The key to driving both preference and growth is to continue to listen to our guests: what they like, what they want, and how we can deliver on our mission to bring joy to their everyday lives.","If we continue this focus and move quickly to deliver more convenience, newness and inspiration, we are confident that we can create an even stronger brand and build on the meaningful progress we've already seen over the last year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks Mark. Last year, we embarked on a multiyear journey to transform our business and position Target to generate profitable long-term growth. We said 2017 would be an investment year. And last year, our team delivered everything we planned to accomplish and more.","We've now moved into 2018, a transition year in which we expect to achieve stability and earnings from our core business. And I'm happy to say, with one quarter in the books, we are on-track to deliver on both our strategic goals and financial guidance for this year.","Our first quarter comparable sales growth of 3% compares favorably to our guidance for a low single-digit increase. This was driven by a 3.7% increase in traffic, offset by a small decline in average ticket.","Our first quarter digital growth of 28%, on top of 21% last year, compounds to more than 50% over the last two years. Target's traffic has been accelerating for a year now and as Brian noted, first quarter growth of 3.7% was the strongest at Target in more than 10 years.","Also notable, the prior quarter's traffic growth of 3.2% was equal to the second-highest pace we've seen in the last 10 years. Traffic is a key focus for us and seeing growth at historic highs gives us increased confidence that we're pursuing the right strategies and making the right investment to best position Target for long-term success.","Our first quarter gross margin rate of 29.8% was down about 20 basis points from last year. This was a bit below our expectations as the mix impact of late spring weather caused a later-than-usual surge in higher margin, temperature-sensitive categories. As temperatures warmed up in mid to late April, we saw the beginning of that surge, and it has continued into this quarter.","With this change, we are confident that we remain on-track to deliver our previous guidance for the year and it's one of the reasons we expect comparable sales growth to move higher in the second quarter.","Our first quarter SG&A expense rate of 21.1% was about 40 basis points higher than last year. This increase was right on our expectations and was driven by planned investments in our team, including wages and other items and increased investment in stores.","Our D&A expense rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year, reflecting accelerated depreciation on our remodel program as it ramps up from last year's pace. Altogether, our operating income margin rate was 6.2% in the first quarter, a little lower than our expectations because of the gross margin mix of our sales.","Below the operating income line, our first quarter net interest expense was $19 million lower than last year. This reflects the impact of last year's debt refinancing and retirement activity.","And finally, our effective income tax rate was 22.6% in the first quarter compared with 34.5% last year. This change was primarily driven by last year's federal tax reform legislation.","Altogether, these results drove first quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $1.33 and adjusted EPS of $1.32. Both of these metrics increased more than 9% compared to last year.","One note, my remarks and today's press release reflect several new accounting standards that we've adopted this quarter. We provided detail on these changes in a Form 8-K filing on May 11th. And in that filing, we included updated prior year numbers that reflect these new policies. So, you could adjust your models to reflect the new accounting.","If you haven't already, I encourage you to review the materials in that filing. And following that review, if you have any questions about these changes and how they've affected the presentation of our financials, please reach out to John Hulbert and we will work to answer your questions.","At the end of the first quarter, our inventory was up about 9% compared with a year ago. As John Mulligan mentioned, this increase reflects a couple of timing issues, along with the impact of strategic investments we've made in key categories, which will best position us to gain market share as competitors close stores or liquidate their operations.","Turning now to capital deployment, we made capital investments of more than $800 million in the first quarter and returned more than $800 million of additional capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We funded these investments and shareholder returns through cash from operation as well as excess cash we held on our balance sheet going into the year.","We remain on track to deliver on all of our capital deployment goals for the year, including capital expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion, maintaining our quarterly dividend with a commitment to annual increases and continued share repurchase within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.","As reported, our first quarter after-tax ROIC was 15.2% compared with 13.8% last year. However, this year's metric reflects the nonrecurring benefit of the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities that occurred as a result of federal tax reform.","Excluding this benefit, our first quarter ROIC was 13.5%. While this is down from last year's result, it is still a very healthy absolute performance. And given that ROIC is a trailing measure, this decline was expected when we initiated last year's investments of both capital and operating income to best position Target for the long-term. Over time, we expect ROIC to grow into the mid-teens as we see the long-term benefit from the repositioning that began last year.","So, now let's turn to our guidance for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, beyond the momentum we're already seeing in our business, sales in May have benefited from a surge in warm weather categories.","In addition, our second quarter comp sales will benefit from this year's calendar shift, which moves an extra week of the back-to-school season into the quarter, replacing a week in early May.","Given these benefits, combined with the underlying strength of our traffic, we expect our comparable sales growth to increase from our first quarter pace, moving it into the low to mid-single-digit range.","On the operating income margin rate line, we expect a decline of about 40 basis points from last year's rate. This reflects roughly equal changes on the gross margin and SG&A expense lines.","In addition, we expect D&A expense to come in about $40 million higher than last year, reflecting accelerated depreciation on assets taken out of service due to our remodel program.","One note, this increase in second quarter D&A is lower than we originally expected as our team has recently implemented a process improvement that reduces the time between remodel approval and project initiation. This resulted in a change in expected timing of accelerated depreciation within the year, which led to the reduction in our D&A expectation for the second quarter.","Moving further down the P&L, we expect second quarter net interest expense to come in about $15 million lower than last year, and we expect an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 25%. Altogether, our expectations lead to expected second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.50. And for the full year, we are on-track to deliver our previous guidance for a low-single-digit increase in comparable sales and GAAP and adjusted EPS of $5.15 to $5.45.","When you look back at the last year, our team has been on quite a journey. Only five quarters ago, we made the decision to embark on a bold, ambitious plan to reshape our business. In the near-term, we knew that decision will put pressure on our financial performance, but we were confident we were making the right long-term move.","Today, a little more than a year later, our traffic is growing at historically strong rates as guests are responding to the changes we've been making. None of this could have happened without the tireless efforts of an outstanding team who have always believed in Target and what we can accomplish together. As a shareholder, I'm incredibly grateful for their efforts and as a fellow team member, I'm incredibly proud to work by their side.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Brian for some final remarks.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Cathy. Based on what you've heard today, I hope you can see why we are so encouraged by what we're seeing in our business. Target has always thrived by being different, by being the best version of ourselves, not another version of someone else. And we've earned the deep loyalty of our guests because we are different, because we deliver a unique assortment and experience, one that's optimistic, aspirational, and full of possibilities.","But being different means always changing. Right now, we're investing to deliver differentiation that matters in today's world, focusing on convenience, digital brands, our operating model, small formats, and the look and feel of existing stores. And we're investing in our greatest differentiator, our team, because human touch still matters even in a digital world.","Thanks for your time today. Now, John, Mark, Cathy and I will move to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","The first question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew McClintock","Yes, good morning everyone. I was wondering if we could start with just traffic, the best traffic that I've probably seen in my career. And it's also the best traffic -- one of the best traffic results probably across the retail industry. Could you help us parse out the strength that you're seeing there? Because you have a lot of things going on right now, is Drive-Up having a material benefit? Is Shipt having a material benefit? Or are we just -- is that traffic result really just the build of your merchandising initiatives over the last year? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","I think you've summarized it well. I think as we sit here today, we feel really good about the traffic that we've generated in the first quarter and the acceleration of that traffic as we go into Q2. And as we've said in some of our prepared remarks, it's really the combination of all of these initiatives working together.","And for several years now, I've talked about the importance of traffic as a true indicator of the health of our business and the guest reaction to our key strategic initiatives. So, they're all coming together well. I think the guest is reacting to our new remodels, to the new brands, to our new fulfillment options, to what we're doing from a digital standpoint. All of these elements have come together, and the guest is rewarding us with increased traffic.","So, we felt great about the traffic number growing by 3.7%, the best traffic growth we've seen in over a decade. And importantly, that traffic growth is continuing as we go into Q2. So, it's really the culmination of all of the initiatives coming together and the guests recognizing the changes we're making at Target.","Matthew McClintock","And then if I could have a follow-up, just on the remodels themselves. Partially why the traffic number is so impressive is you're doing some major remodels that I would assume are taking a lot of stores down and pretty much out of commission, right? So, can you help me think about the negative impact from remodels this year now that you've done 50 and you're going into another 100 into this quarter? Is that in line with your expectations? Or are they -- is it a little bit more of a drag than you thought? Or are you doing those ahead of expectations? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Matt, the remodel is performing exactly the way we had planned. Obviously, there is a disruption during the construction period. But our team is getting better and better at minimizing the disruption, accelerating the remodel time frame. And the guest is reacting very well as we complete these remodels. So, the remodel initiative is working exceptionally well for us. We're generating the 2% to 4% lift that we're projecting, and the guest reaction has been superb.","Matthew McClintock","Appreciate the color. Best of luck.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Oliver Chen. Your line is now open.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. We were curious about the delivery options and becoming America's easiest place to shop. You've done a really good job with all the innovation there. How would you prioritize the options that customers have in terms of driving the financial algorithm, in terms of which ones may be more important at the top of your list for driving our models?","Also, as we think about the fill-in trips and the Pay Less part of the equation, what are your thoughts about fill-in versus stock-up, and how you're positioned with respect to the back half of the year and where you see opportunities? It sounds like the customer perception scores have gotten better with respect to value. Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Oliver, a number of different questions, so I'll try to unpack each one of them. But as we think about the overall experience and making sure that we provide ease to our guests, we're taking a very balanced approach. We want to make sure we provide a great in-store experience. It's why we're investing in remodels, investing in our team, investing in specialized services in the store.","And then we recognize that from time-to-time, our guest is looking for alternative ways to shop. So, we want to make it really easy for them to order online and conveniently pick up in one of our stores. We're seeing a great reaction, as John mentioned, to our Drive-Up service. And as we expand that service, we continue to hear the guests talk about how much they enjoy that.","Obviously, with Shipt, we're now in over 70 markets, and the guest reaction has been superb. And our ability to deliver goods to their homes in now minutes is being very well-received. So, we want to make sure we provide a great experience no matter how the guest wants to shop. And I think more and more of the initiatives that we're rolling out, whether it's Drive-Up or Shipt, what we're doing with the expansion of Restock, all being very well-received.","But importantly, we're seeing a very positive reaction to the in-store experience. And while we feel great about the overall traffic numbers and the comp numbers, what's really encouraging is guests are coming to our stores and enjoying that experience, and they're shopping the full portfolio while they're there.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. And a quick one, Cathy. It's really encouraging that the business trends have picked up with improving weather. However, the mix impact on the gross margin wasn't quite where you wanted it to be. Just what gives you conviction on the guidance in terms of where you can be in relation to diving into some of your comments? Thank you.","Cathy Smith","Yes. Good morning Oliver. As we said, clearly, every -- much of the first quarter played out exactly as we would have planned and hoped for. Other than that late temperature-sensitive category, which drove some mix pressure, we've seen that all come back into the beginning -- end of April and the beginning of this quarter, and so we're really confident.","And then in addition, we have a number of initiatives we started last year that will start to cycle over about -- thinking about our price and promo reinvestments and stuff, give us confidence toward the back half of the year, and then some cost initiatives.","Oliver Chen","Great job on that new brands and stores. Best regards.","Brian Cornell","Oliver, thank you.","John Mulligan","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Edward Kelly","Yes, hi. Good morning guys. Could you provide a little bit more color on the impact you think weather may have had within Q1 and the benefit that this, plus the calendar shift, will have within Q2? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of the cadence of the comp.","And then as we think about progressing through the back half of the year, you've imposed, may I guess, the comparison seems like maybe it's a little bit harder. Just how should we think about the progression this year?","Cathy Smith","Yes. So, the weather, we do -- obviously, because of our multi-category assortment, we have great strength. We saw some really strong trends in home, essentials, beauty, food & beverage, which are great. It was those really temperature-sensitive categories that we did see a little bit of challenge there in early April, which came straight back.","So, I would tell you the strength of that tells us, and we can see it, where weather was happening, we could see the strength and\/or not. So, really strong confidence around the multi-category assortment coming through throughout the year. And I'm sorry, Ed, what was the second part of your question?","Edward Kelly","Just how we think about the calendar impact and the underlying Q2 comp?","Cathy Smith","Yes. Yes, so we saw a little bit of benefit -- or a little bit of benefit in Q1, a little bit more benefit in Q2. But obviously, that's all contemplated into our guidance and that gives us additional confidence into the guidance we've given.","Edward Kelly","And then, Cathy, can I just go back to -- on the margin side? So, Q1 was a bit softer, I guess, than expected and mix had something to do with that. But you expect an improvement throughout the year as we think about EBITDA margins, let's look at it like that, I guess, to try to minimize the D&A impact.","But it does seem like digital will continue to ramp and be important. Wages obviously going $12 an hour, a headwind. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on, as we progress through the year, what drives the improvement in the year-over-year margin relative to sort of what we're seeing in Q1?","Cathy Smith","Yes. So, Q1 really did play out much as we would have expected. Obviously, the really strong traffic drove some great comp sales. We are investing in the SG&A that we said we were going to invest. So, that was really very, very consistent.","And in all fairness, gross margin played out exactly as we would have expected, except for a little different mix. And so a little bit stronger essentials and beauty and food & beverage, a little bit weaker with the temperature-sensitive categories that came back toward the end of the quarter. And so it's just literally a mixed conversation in Q1.","What gives me confidence going through the rest of the year, we'll continue to invest in our business, as we've said, for the long-term. That's consistent. We've got gross margin plans, obviously, as we cycle over some of those investments last year as well as those cost initiatives, which we've got planned and have planned into our guidance.","Brian Cornell","Ed, I'll just reinforce the point, we're very confident in our full year guidance, both from a comp standpoint and an EPS standpoint. And as Mark alluded to in his comments, the reaction to our owned brands in apparel and home has been very strong. We've got a number of new brands we'll launch over the balance of the year, and we certainly expect that's going to influence the mix of our business as we go into Q2, Q3 and the holiday season.","So, we're very confident with the way the business is performing. We're seeing a very strong start to Q2, acceleration off of what we consider a very strong start to the year in Q1. And it gives us increased confidence in our full year guidance.","Edward Kelly","Great. Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Seth Sigman","Hey guys. Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow-up questions here on the margins. Aside from the mix, as we're looking at, I guess, first, the price investments you've been making, remind us when do you actually cycle fully those price investments? And regular price was up $1 billion, I think, you said year-over-year, which seems pretty meaningful. Should we interpret that as the biggest changes are done and you feel pretty good about the value proposition, and we could see that benefit as you move through the year?","Mark Tritton","Yes, Seth, Mark here. Thanks. What we're seeing is a cycle over our LY. We really were starting to implement price changes right at the very end of Q2 leading through Q3 and really maturing through Q4.","So, we're still in an evolutionary process, and we start to see that balance out by Q3. So, there's some benefits again into the mix and private value to LY still in Q2 with stability going from Q3 onwards.","Seth Sigman","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the digital and fulfillment cost, part of the outlook, I think, included the benefit from more ship from store to mitigate some of the cost pressures. Can you update us on that, give us a sense of the impact that fulfillment may have had on gross margin this quarter? And is that also something you expect to improve through the year?","John Mulligan","Yes. So, I think nothing new here, really. Digital fulfillment sales have put pressure on gross margin as that continues to grow faster than the rest of the business. But on the other side of that, as you pointed out, as we continue to ship more from our stores, that is the, first, the fastest way to ship for our guest; and second, it's the most efficient from a cost perspective for us.","And the other thing I would point to is when we introduce things like two-day shipping, we see lift in units as well. And so as we increase units, the cost per unit to fulfill goes down dramatically.","The same is true with Shipt, where those basket sizes are almost double the average basket size that we see in the chain and so the cost per unit to fulfill goes down meaningfully.","And so that's one thing. Mike McNamara and the digital team are focused on is continuing to drive -- as we lower the actual cost to deliver, the team continues to focus on driving the average basket size to lower the cost per unit and improve the unit economics across all of our digital business.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. I really had a bigger-picture question maybe to help frame the great traffic results, but also for the cost involved. So, I think if we look at EBIT dollars were down 10% in the first quarter and you have this best traffic in years. But given the investments you made last year, it sounds like by the back half, to get to your guidance, EBIT dollar should be going up mid-single-digit. Is my -- does my math sound right, Cathy, given all the restatements that that's what we should be seeing?","Cathy Smith","Yes. Yes, no, Greg, you're right on.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then sort of a housekeeping question. The week that shifts, a week that's in July or for back-to-school versus a week in May, is that typically 20% bigger, 40% bigger? Just something there so we can do the math on the comp shift.","Cathy Smith","Yes, Greg, so just think about it this way, we literally just map week-for-week. So, the first 13 weeks of this quarter were the first 13 weeks and just kind of roll that out. Obviously, it does pull a little bit of back-to-school, back-to-college, which is why you're seeing some inventory come through as well, but we're not going to quantify that.","Greg Melich","Okay, great. And then just the last, maybe a bit of big-picture question on the margins. If you think about it, given this surge in traffic and you think about a few years out, if you could keep the traffic up here, would you be willing to let the margin rate continue to slip to, I guess, around 6% now to 5% if that's what it took to keep this sort of traffic number? And I'll leave it.","Brian Cornell","Greg, I think, again, the guest is reacting to the changes we've made throughout our experience, whether it's the new brands, which I think are going to continue to deliver great results and deliver very strong margins for us.","The multi-category strength we saw in the quarter is something that we feel really good about. We've been talking about this for some time. But seeing strength in home, in household essentials, in Beauty, in food & beverage, the guest is reacting to our offerings, and they're shopping multiple categories at Target both in-store and online.","So, we expect that to continue. And as we remodel more stores, as we open up stores in new neighborhoods, as we continue to offer great new brands and new services, we expect traffic to continue to grow.","So, we think traffic was one of the highlights in the quarter, but we also feel really good about the fact that we grew comps to 3%, our digital channel grew by 28% and our EPS grew by over 9%. So, we feel like all of the key initiatives are coming together, and we're delivering very solid results that are in line with our plan for 2018.","Greg Melich","That's great. Congrats, good luck.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Greg.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys thanks for taking the questions. So, I just -- not to beat a dead horse here on the comp cadence, but I'm getting lots of e-mails, so I figured I'd do one more. As we look at the back half of the year, is it going to step down because of the calendar shift and the tough compares? Is that the expectation?","Brian Cornell","Scott, we're expecting again low single-digit comp growth throughout the year. We're seeing really strong acceleration as we go into Q2, so we expect to see comps grow as we go into the second quarter. But our guidance is something that we got great confidence in, and we expect to see solid comp expansion throughout the year.","Scott Mushkin","All right, perfect. Then my second question is regarding kind of the store operations. The in-stock levels, at least according to our research are coming off, especially consumables. And I think you made some changes at the store in how you're managing it. I just wondered if you could maybe explain what's going on at the stores and why maybe we're seeing some better in-stock conditions at the store.","Brian Cornell","Yes, why don't we let John talk about some of the changes we're making with our store operating model?","John Mulligan","Yes. The store team has been going through a process of modernizing our store operating model. It's out in -- it's in pilot right now in what we would call 26 districts across the country.","I mean, really the idea here is to get experts in the areas where they know the business. So, we have food people who know the Food business, and they are accountable for the totality of that business. They do the restock. They do intraday restocking. They own price change. They own everything that goes on in that business. Similarly, in apparel or beauty or electronics and they also have expertise to help the guest understand those specialty businesses, and that's a big part of what we're doing, too.","But as they own the business, and we've seen this in beauty over the past 52 weeks for the team, we are further ahead in beauty, we see out-of-stocks improve because the same person is in that area every single day, and they own it, and they make sure it's stocked. So, some great progress there. We're a little bit further in areas like food and beauty than we are -- and apparel than we are in a couple of others. But that's the focus across the entirety of the store operations.","And I would say, Scott, too, that's been a big part of our out-of-stocks. There's also some things we're doing upstream as it relates to inventory positioning, improving our speed of recovery across the chain as well. So, there's a lot of moving parts there as it relates to out-of-stocks, but obviously, as you know, it's something we are very, very focused on.","Scott Mushkin","And John, how many store is it in right now? And what's your expectation as we get through the end of the year? Thank you.","John Mulligan","It depends on -- there's lots of moving parts. Beauty is across the entire chain right now, and food & beverage operating model is probably across most of the chain as well. Some of the other pieces, we're testing different changes across about a quarter of the business. So, it's in various stages, and we'll continue to refine it and roll that out across the chain as we move forward.","Brian Cornell","Look, Scott, this is a part of the investments we've been making in our store teams over the last few years. It was just a few years ago we rolled out visual merchandising across the entire chain, investing in beauty, and we're seeing great results as a by-product of that.","Special resources behind food & beverage, and that's certainly improving both our performance, helping us grow share, but also improving the in-stock condition. So, we'll continue to make those investments over the balance of the year. But importantly, the guest is responding to those changes, and they've been a very important part in driving the comp increases we saw in the first quarter.","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Chris Horvers from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks and good morning. So, I'm going to take a shot at the shift question. So, as you think about the shift, does it impact as you offset come in 3Q, or does it impact in 4Q as well?","And then on the e-commerce front, does Drive-Up and Shipt show up in digital comp or the store comp? It seems like they're scaling over the year, so does that mean that digital growth actually accelerates throughout the year? Because it seems like the big helper in 1Q was more the free ship versus these other fulfillment options, which are still being rolled out.","Brian Cornell","Yes. So, Chris, things like Shipt and Drive-Up show up in our digital comp, and we've talked about this a lot. From a guest standpoint, I don't think they really care how we account for it. They just care about the fact that we've got these great convenient services that we now offer them throughout the year. So, that is part of our digital comp. It's part of the strong performance we're seeing in digital. And we expect that to continue over the balance of the year. Cathy, you want to talk about the shift one last time?","Cathy Smith","Yes. With regards to the calendar, so it's again really simple, just map week-for-week is what we do, which means you're going to see a little bit -- we saw a little bit of benefit this quarter, a little bit more next quarter, a little less -- a little headwind in Q3 and a little bit more in Q4, and it's kind of that throughout the course of the year.","Chris Horvers","Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Good. Well, we appreciate you joining us today. Hopefully, you sense the confidence we have in our business. We feel great about the start of the year in Q1, the acceleration we're seeing in Q2 and our confidence in our full year guidance. So, operator, that concludes our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call and I thank all of you for joining us."],"20443":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call February 28, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","John Hulbert - Vice President, Investor Relations","Brian Cornell - Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","John Mulligan - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Cathy Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Mark Tritton - Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer","Michael McNamara - Executive Vice President, Chief Information and Digital Officer","Analysts","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Michael Lasser - UBS","Craig Johnson - Customer Growth Partners","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Matthew McClintock - Barclays","Peter Benedict - Robert W.

We have a lot to cover today, so we\u2019re going to get started in just a minute. But we have a couple of important disclosures up front that I\u2019m just going to read verbatim to you.","Any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And the second one is our earnings press releases and SEC filings available on target.com\/investors provide reconciliations of adjusted EPS to our GAAP results and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP components of ROIC.","With that, we\u2019ll get on with the show.","Brian Cornell","Well, thank you, John. Welcome, and thanks for joining us this morning. Today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our strategy. I\u2019ll talk about where we\u2019ve been and more importantly, what\u2019s next. John will share more details about what we\u2019re doing to get there, and then Cathy will walk through our financial model. At the end of that, we\u2019ll spend the balance of the program taking your questions.","As you all know, we\u2019ve been on a multi-year journey to redefine the future of our company to compete and ultimately win in this new era of retail. For the past several years, we\u2019ve been watching several key consumer trends emerge. People are placing greater value on experiences. Often they would rather live it than own it, especially young people.","When they buy, they want to buy into a greater purpose, not just a product. Taken together, these changes can only be described as a profound shift in the consumer mindset. Then combine that with the different behaviors around how and where consumers are choosing to shop. Today, there is total transparency. Ease and speed are paramount. The shift in channel preference is real and only gaining momentum. Our industry is the midst of a seismic shift, and, of course, you read the headlines.","In fact, many of you write the reports, we\u2019re operating in an incredibly challenging environment. All across the retail industry, many of our competitors are aggressively rationalizing their assets. They are closing stores, exiting markets. They\u2019re cutting costs just to keep their heads above water. We\u2019ve not seen this number of distressed retailers since 2009 in the Great Recession. This contraction will create opportunities for Target to pick up market share over the long-term, but aggressive promotional activity will create pressure on our business in the near-term. At the same time, there are others who are thriving in this new environment. So the changes we\u2019re making aims squarely at moving Target into the retail winner circle.","Now, I stood before you a year ago and I laid out five key priorities. I talked about on-demand shopping, establishing category roles, localization and personalization. I talked about small formats, and I talked about simplifying and controlling our costs. And we\u2019ve made good progress executing against these priorities. But it\u2019s become very clear that our efforts were not enough to win in this changing and challenging environment, and you\u2019ve seen that in our recent results.","We\u2019ll continue to have these same priorities, but today we\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going to be different. We all know the industry shift has begun to accelerate, and we believe that rate of acceleration will only continue to increase. You see it, our competitors see it. John, Cathy and I, well, we live it every single day.","But what I want to talk about today is how at Target we are embracing this new reality, how we are building a company that\u2019s poised to lead and grow market share in digital and in our stores. And how we are laser focused on mastering execution and accelerating our efforts to become an even stronger competitor. Let\u2019s go back to 2014, the Black Friday weekend.","In 2014, more than 93% of our transactions took place in stores, less than 7% digital. That season we had just started shipping from a small number of stores. 2015, that same timeframe, digital sales reached almost 10% of our total sales. We more than doubled our ship from store capability to nearly 500 stores. We fulfilled 41% of all our digital orders inside of a store.","2016, just a few months ago, just last year, digital sales climbed to 14%, more than twice what we did two years earlier. We double shipped from stores again, more than 1,000 stores. Our stores were fulfilling 68% of our digital orders. We finished December with record digital growth, including record-breaking days on both Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.","We realize on more and more shopping journeys our guests are looking to save time by using digital, and we only expect that trend to continue. But I know and you know, this channel shift comes with additional challenges. Today, that essential base Target run doesn\u2019t completely translate to the new digital world. Traffic drivers are fundamentally different and guests behave differently too. Put a guest in the store, they are looking for inspiration, they enjoy discovery, they enjoy shopping. But very often a visit to Target.com, it\u2019s far more transactional. One item at a time, logon, check out, as fast as possible friction free.","Now, we\u2019ve proven we can build baskets with more storytelling and inspiring site merchandising, like we\u2019ve done in kids with Cat & Jack. So there\u2019s an incredible opportunity for us to do more. But we also need to make sure, we don\u2019t impede efficiency, or complicate the overall experience in the process.","So this combination of changing behaviors and expectation is certainly causing stress in our model. But the reality is, this is where the guest wants to be. We will never be successful if we dig in and insist they shop the way their parents did. So, as I said before, given these realities, we are embracing the change.","We are reimagining and repositioning our assets to deliver even greater competitive advantage going forward. It\u2019s moving from a very linear model, supplier, distribution center, store-to-guest to creating a smart network. We\u2019re distribution centers, stores, digital channels, they become guest-facing access points, where Target is always on, where Target is always within reach, down the street on your door step, or simply in the palm of your hand.","So the challenge ahead is really about continuing to understand how consumer preference and expectations are evolving. Anticipating where they are going, what they\u2019ll want before they have to tell us. Finding new ways to engage at every stage in every occasion. Offering and clearly communicating compelling value in every interaction at every touch points and building a new Target that\u2019s uniquely positioned to compete and win, delivering on two pillars of market share growth, one digital, and one physical.","So this morning, I want to talk about what that looks like. The capabilities we\u2019re building, the investments we\u2019re making to emerge as a stronger competitor and ultimately grow. But I don\u2019t want to gloss over the important point. This isn\u2019t work, we just started. These aren\u2019t things we\u2019ll eventually do. These are initiatives that are well underway and we\u2019re making progress. What is changing is our speed. Maintaining our current margin rate will not allow us to go fast enough.","We\u2019re aggressively investing in the business to make sure we are highly competitive on price across our assortment all day and every day. We are making significant capital investments that will position Target for the long run, long-term sustainable growth. And all the while, as the investments take root, you will see a much sharper focus on execution every day in our stores, every day online, every day throughout our enterprise.","So let\u2019s start with some of those foundational capabilities we\u2019ve been testing, building and beginning to scale. These are non-negotiables for any retailer that\u2019s going to win in this new era. These initiatives represent significant investments in terms of capital and talent, and they\u2019ll continue to be among our highest priorities in the years ahead.","In the last three years, we\u2019ve more than doubled our digital sales from $1.4 billion in 2013 to more than $3.4 billion last year. And we did that in large part, because the investments we made to replatform our sites and mobile channels. Today, we have an entirely new engine under the hood. It gives us vastly more power in terms of speed, stability, performance and capability. We set up new functions investing in top engineering and data science talent and trained them to make sure their scope impacted the entire enterprise.","Now not long ago at Target, this was a new function. Today, it\u2019s one of our core strengths. When I think about stores, when you look at our store base, you can see that we\u2019ve been highly intentional with our real estate strategies, prime first and second ring suburban locations. By and large, we are not tethered to shopping malls. We\u2019re isolated on some interstate far from guests.","But as you move from coast-to-coast, this experience is uneven at best. In LA, Chicago, Boston we have some beautiful stores. But we also have a large percentage of the portfolio, where the buildings just don\u2019t match the brand. They\u2019re old, they\u2019re tired and they have not been updated in years.","As you know, we spent 2016 testing the best of our enhancements from our store prototype pilot in LA. And now we\u2019re rolling the best of the best, as well as some new features to hundreds of stores across the country. Each store is going to look and feel like a totally new Target. We also see tremendous opportunity expanding our footprint in the key urban neighborhoods and on major college campuses.","The store\u2019s function in every respect as a store, a place you can shop, but they are also just as much hyper local fulfillment centers. Take a look at what we\u2019re doing right here in New York. Until now, we left this massive opportunity on the table, because we didn\u2019t have a solution to literally fitting Target into Manhattan. I can tell you those days are gone.","And just during the last six months, we\u2019ve opened up three new stores in Tribeca, downtown in Brooklyn, and Forest Hills, Queens. Three very different sites, three different neighborhoods, three completely different experiences. Each one customized to fit the neighborhood. And I can tell you, you can expect to see more and more of these across the city.","In New York and beyond, we\u2019ve been purposely very disciplined in our approach. But now, I can tell you it\u2019s time for us to accelerate this new format. Behind the scenes, our supply chain is in the midst of a total transformation, aimed at leveraging our proximity to the guest to unlock even greater value. How do we get just the right amount of product to exactly the right place at exactly the right time?","The work underway is game changing for Target. It will significantly reduce costs and dramatically improved speed, efficiency and reliability across our network. Target\u2019s scale and commitment to operational excellence has long been one of our true competitive advantages. But in this new era, size is not the endpoint.","How we leverage our size and scale not just in supply chain, but the entire enterprise is supremely important. But size is only an advantage if we use it the right way. In football, a lineman who is big and strong, but slow is easily outmaneuvered. But a player who is big, strong, quick on his feet is virtually unstoppable. The key to our future success is the focus on greater agility.","So you will see that in the way we are leveraging this network. But it goes deeper than that. You see the advantages we have in our multi-category portfolio and how it allows us to flex and manage trends in the marketplace. You see that in our balance sheet, which gives us the ability to invest to grow even during challenging times.","The third and final piece of our strategy is about standing proud and being confident about who we are, holding up the power and the potential of our brand as a beacon, and leaning into all the reasons guests fell for Target in the first place.","So at the start this morning, I talked about how we\u2019re looking at this seismic and accelerating shift in our industry and that\u2019s true. But you know better than anyone that these inflection points come around every generation or so. And strong retailers endure, while others, well, they don\u2019t. Pick your era defining change throughout history from downtown department stores to suburban malls, catalogs, e-commerce.","Target not only weathered the storm, we emerged better positioned as a result, and that\u2019s for many reasons. One, we know our guest, and we\u2019re making sure that the changes we make continue to build guest love for our brand. We know our guests are rooting for Target to win and those reasons are embedded in our DNA. Our differentiated assortment, an easy and inspiring shopping experience, engaging marketing, a deep commitment to investing in the communities we serve, giving back 5% of our profit, a promise we\u2019ve kept for more than 70 years.","But as guest expectations evolve over time, we have to evolve the way we deliver the things that are most important, ease, value, and inspiration. So today we\u2019re redoubling our efforts. One example is the work underway to reinvent our portfolio of exclusive brands.","Cat & Jack and Pillowfort was just the toe in the water for us. Our teams right now are busy building brand after brand, and they are prepared to unveil them one after another, season after season. In a moment, John will provide a lot more color and content, where we are today and what\u2019s to come. But before I close out, I want to make sure one thing is really clear, that underlying all this work is an unbending commitment to continued operational efficiency. A commitment to invest in our core business, constantly elevating the in-store shopping experience and a commitment to learn and innovate.","To get where we want to go, we know we can\u2019t fixate on short-term opportunity. Target is taking the long view. And we can either bemoan the changing conditions in the marketplace, or we can embrace them and double down on our strengths. Now in all candor, 2016 was not our best year, and we\u2019re facing some headwinds as we begin 2017. But we\u2019re asking shareholders to make a meaningful investment, to build a stronger growing company for the future.","The good news is that, we\u2019ve been working on this for a while, and we know how to align around the change rather than run from it. Our goal today is to demonstrate that the investments we\u2019re making are the right investments for the future, are the right decisions for the long-term and will create greater shareholder value.","John and Cathy will address this in more detail in a few minutes. But in addition to making the capital investments, we\u2019re also investing $1 billion in operating margins this year. It will allow us faster growth over time and ensure we\u2019re competitively priced every day starting right now.","Now clearly, this is a significant change in our financial model. But it reflects the new realities of the seismic shift that\u2019s occurring across our industry. Combine these investments with our unique asset base and we believe Target\u2019s opportunity is fundamentally different from any of our competitors. No one has our stores, no one has our assortment, no one has our brands, no one is closer to the guest, and no one is better positioned to compete in this next generation of retail like Target.","So while others are pulling back, Target is investing to compete and investing to grow. We\u2019re investing in stores. We\u2019re investing in our supply chain and in digital to fuel our business growth. We\u2019re investing to win share, not surrender it. There will be winners and losers in this new era of retail. This plan is all about how we emerge on top. It\u2019s how we strengthen Target\u2019s value proposition to our guests and for our shareholders. It\u2019s how we build a company that will deliver strong returns for many, many years to come. So thank you.","John Mulligan","Good morning, everyone. Well, you just heard it from Brian. Our brands, our smart network, the incredible value we offer our guests put together give us a unique position as we move into this next generation of retail. And over the past few years, we\u2019ve made significant investments to make our assets work even harder, while we\u2019re seeing progress, we\u2019re nowhere near done.","Brian just talked about the record number of days this season when we saw all-time high digital sales. Make no mistake, we\u2019re proud of that performance, but what he didn\u2019t say, and what\u2019s just as important is that, behind the scenes our platform functioned flawlessly. Record online sales, record traffic, and more than enough capacity in the system to keep things humming right along. A year ago, as you well know, it was a different story.","Back in 2015, we introduced a general incentive offer for Cyber Monday, 15% off everything on our site, and our guests went crazy, which was great, right up until it wasn\u2019t. Demand was so high that quite candidly we had to throttle traffic to keep our site from crashing, frustrating guests and leaving millions of dollars on the table, not good. But the message was clear, put together a compelling offer, straightforward, easy to understand with really clear value and our guests will respond. But we also needed to really significantly increase our capacity to support the demand.","So this year, our Chief Information and Digital Officer, Mike McNamara and his team accelerated the reference to deliver a new adaptive platform that give us much more capacity, flexibility and stability. And when we put up record numbers this season, our site did not falter once for our guests. In fact, the new platform allowed us to adjust the site experience in real-time and drive additional sales and still our site had 100% availability all season long.","We invested in going well beyond what would simply help us manage through the next year. We built for the long haul allowing us to imagine our business far down the road. This is what we mean when we say we are investing to compete and grow. It\u2019s what we\u2019re doing across our business. We\u2019re sharpening our operational performance, so we can execute on our plans quickly, while at the same time we\u2019re making investments that set us up to compete in an increasingly fierce environment. We see enormous potential out in front of us and we\u2019re seizing every opportunity to capture it.","First, let\u2019s talk stores, our key competitive advantage. They are at the center of everything we do for our guests regardless of how we deliver. The 40% digital growth we saw in December, they enabled it. In the two days that followed our record-setting cyber Monday, our stores shipped more than 1 million orders to fulfill that demand. The week before Christmas, our stores fulfilled nearly 70% of our target.com orders. And on Christmas Eve, they fulfilled more than 80%, shipping about half of those to our guests and packing the other half for in-store pickup.","Our stores are a center for inspiration and discovery, they always have been and that\u2019s on changing. But when we look at them as buildings stocked with product, they are also local fulfillment centers. Now when you take the products our guests are already love and add in our store network, we have the unique potential to be incredibly competitive against both digital and traditional retailers, because for digital sales to work, you have to be able to deliver quickly and with as little cost as possible. That\u2019s why getting near the consumer has become the Holy Grail in retail.","Online-only competitors are investing rapidly to stand up warehouses that are storefronts that cut the distance between their products and the consumer. But we\u2019re already there, in fact, we\u2019re practically neighbors. 85% of our demand and three quarters of all Americans are about 10 miles or less from our 1,800 stores. So if we\u2019re talking about proximity, we already have it, no question. Brian mentioned that we\u2019re making investments to let us really exploit that advantage to compete on a whole new level.","So let me show you what we mean. So here are those 1,800 stores. We were really intentional about where we put these years ago, most in the suburbs, some in the exurbs, and a few in the city. But now here are the 32 small format stores we opened in the last few years, prime urban neighborhoods, college campuses places where the suburban format just did not fit. These sites are unlocking tremendous value. They have more than two times the sales productivity of our average store.","So even with higher operating costs, they generate healthy returns. They also serve as fulfillment hubs and a convenient pickup point for guests who would rather not have items delivered to the front step of their high-rise condo. In three years, we\u2019ll add more than 100 to where we are today. To get there, we\u2019ll open nearly 30 small format stores this year doubling the number we have now. And we\u2019ll open about 40 a year by 2019 with the potential for many more down the road.","Now this map doesn\u2019t outline every specific location, but it\u2019s representative of where we\u2019ll focus. This will add fulfillment points in dense neighborhoods in cities like New York, LA and Chicago, and near more college campuses, where lifelong shopping habits and brand affinities begin to take hold. As we expand, we will continue our hyper local approach. Before we plan a store, we get to know the neighbors, who they are and what they need. Then we design experience from the store\u2019s layout to the merchandise inside that fits its localization at its core.","Take a look.","[Commercials]","So I showed you how we are expanding our footprint with more than 100 small format stores over the next three years. At the same time, we\u2019ll begin an effort to transform our existing locations.","As Brian said, our store asset base is a key differentiator for us, but there is a big gap between how those stores should look and feel for our guests and where we are today. We know that to really compete in a local market we need to make some big investments in those buildings and so we are.","Starting in 2017, we\u2019ll reimagine 100 of our existing locations. We\u2019ll pull elements from our new store prototype, which we designed based on how guests responded to a multitude of tests we\u2019ve run over the past few years like our LA25 pilot. For this prototype, we took a fresh look at everything, from the front of the store to the back room layout, the entrance displays to the product presentation, food and beverage to apparel.","As we build on what worked in LA25 and add even more enhancements with this new prototype, we expect to see a 2% to 4% sales lift per store. Not only will they feel like brand new stores, they\u2019ll do even more than they can do today. The design will be flexible, so the store can be configured to reflect the needs of each community.","We\u2019ll have more space dedicated to visual storytelling, inspiring guests by showing products together like entire outfits or table settings. And we\u2019ll reallocate space to support digital fulfillment, such as adding more room for order pickup and designing back rooms to grow our ship from store capabilities.","In 2018, we\u2019ll touch more than 250 stores and do that once again the next year. But we won\u2019t be rolling out the same thing every time. Well iterate, so we\u2019re always delivering new services and enhancements based on what we are hearing from guests. By 2019, we\u2019ll have reached 600 stores and that\u2019s just the beginning. We\u2019ll continue to make these investments, so our stores can deliver the very best to our guests no matter the channel.","With these enhancements, we will be able to expand ship from store capabilities beyond the 1,000-plus stores shipping today. Just as every store already serves as an order pickup location. By 2019, most stores will be shipping orders from the back room. And because we are improving how we flow product across our network, which I will talk about in a few minutes, each store will have even more of our assortment available to ship. You can see how this map gets really rich over the next year and into the next three years.","We continue getting closer to the guests shipping from more of our assets and improving the in-store experience across the country. We are also doing work in all stores to make it easier for guests to shop, no matter if their trip starts online or in-store. Take order pick up, which after nearly three years, we still see growing rapidly. Guests chose to have nearly 50% more items picked up in store this year than last. And they love that we\u2019ll have it ready for them within an hour or two.","We\u2019re making it easier and faster by separating the pickup and return areas, and we\u2019re moving toward a future, where we will use technology to alert the team when guests arrive. We are also continuing to fold digital into the physical shopping experience. Today, guests use Cartwheel, our digital savings app, nearly 5 million times every week. They use it to plan their trips and shop the stores.","Later this year, we will combine Cartwheel and our Target app to make shopping at Target even more easier and convenient. Guests will be able to make their lists, find items in stores, take advantage of great offers, and pay for their orders, all within a single app. And in our refresh stores, we\u2019ll test technology that gives the guest the ability to opt in and see what products around them are on sale with Cartwheel.","So it will be simple for them to find great value, while checking things off their list. At the same time, we\u2019re making the shopping trip even more inspirational. For the past year or two, we\u2019ve been testing new visual merchandising strategies and watching how our guests respond.","Now, we\u2019re taking those learnings and cross-merchandising even more product categories. We\u2019re rearranging floor pads and standing up more compelling displays to help guests imagine how products work together and fit into their own lives. We\u2019re taking a similar approach to how we\u2019re featuring products on our site, so it\u2019s easier for guests to explore and find what they need, while discovering a few extra items along the way. In our stores, we know that human interaction plays a big role in the guest\u2019s experience. It\u2019s why our talented store team is such an asset.","Our expectation of store team leaders is a good example. Gone are the days when we sent a playbook from HQ and ask the teams to execute word for word. We\u2019re empowering and expecting store leaders to know their communities, know their guests, and do what\u2019s right.","Let me tell you about a store leader in Orange County, California named Kerry Kiper. She has a guest space that is very passionate about beer, not wine, and not just the domestic big guys. Her guests love craft beer. But instead of just stocking what our buyers in Minneapolis sent her way, she asked around, listened to her guests, shopped the competition and selected an assortment with the buying team that reflected what her guests want, and guess what?","Just like that Cyber Monday sale, give the guests what they want and they respond. And at Kerry\u2019s store they responded big time. Her micro beer sales shot up 60%. In fact, she saw a lift across her whole adult beverage business. As a result, we built a process at headquarters to capture those insights from the front lines, so our teams can work together to localize assortments across the country.","Kerry is just one example of how we\u2019re driving a cultural shift across the company. And we\u2019re seeing what happens when we clear the way for the experts to do their jobs. But we are not asking our store leaders to act on gut alone. We\u2019re giving star teams far more data, metrics and training to help make smart decisions. We\u2019re also giving the teams technology to improve a guest\u2019s experience and save the sale.","This summer, we\u2019re implementing a program where when a guest wants a different size or color our team members will take care of everything. They will be able to search our network\u2019s inventory, take payment from a mobile point-of-sale system, and arrange home delivery right from the sales floor. We expect to offer this level of service in all stores by holiday.","Finally, we are simplifying operational tasks, so our store teams can focus more of their energy on helping the guest. To make all of that work, we\u2019re leveraging the skills of our team members. We\u2019ve always cross-trained our teams, so they can perform almost any task in the store.","Now, we\u2019re also standing up specialized teams like the crews that handle digital fulfillment, or food, and giving them more focused training, so they can use their expertise to best serve the guests. Improving the store experience is an enormous body of work. But it\u2019s no secret that investing in our stores is only part of the equation. And you know that our supply chain has been a major focus for our team.","This past year, we hired a lot of talent with deep expertise and set wheels in motion for a major revolution of how we operate. We\u2019ve honed in on two points we have to fix. To put it bluntly, we are slow and we have too much inventory. And I can\u2019t tell you how painful it used to be to say that out loud. But now I\u2019m actually eager to share it, because I\u2019m so confident the work we\u2019re doing will position us to compete on a whole new level. Fundamentally, we\u2019re changing how we move product.","For the last 50 years, our supply chain has moved big case packs of product and we\u2019ve done it slowly. In the future, we know we\u2019ll still have to move cases. But to replenish our stores faster and manage the growing digital demand, we have to start moving individual items too. The concept is really pretty simple. When a store sells one bottle of a certain shampoo, we put one of those bottles on the next store truck within hours. It\u2019s replenishing to actual guest demand and doing it fast.","Now to someone not familiar with supply chains that might not seem like a big deal. But here\u2019s why it is. When we move with that much speed and precision, all the product that comes into a store can go straight to the sales floor. Nothing sticks around in the back room. Out-of-stock goes down, safety stock goes down and our speed goes up, way up, plus it\u2019s exactly how we need to move product to fulfill an increasing number of individual target.com orders.","Above all, we get faster and more reliable and the guest wins. Then we can dedicate that back room space to more productive activities, like storing online only product for order pick, or shipping digital orders. And there\u2019s no extra product at one store when it could be used at another. I just talked about scaling our small format stores. This operating model is absolutely key to pulling that off.","In those stores where back rooms are typically tight or almost non-existent, we will be better equipped to send product needed in real time instead of relying on backroom storage.","Today, we have several pilots already underway and we will start transitioning to this model in the spring starting in the Northeast. The opportunities these changes open up in terms of last-mile delivery speed are really exciting. We\u2019ll ship faster and at a lower cost, improving guest satisfaction and digital profitability. It has the potential to give guests more options for how to shop and how to truly get it whenever they want it.","I\u2019m very encouraged by the work already underway and about what our team expects will do in the next few years. We\u2019ve set out to completely transform how we deliver for our guests, and I can\u2019t wait to share more as we make progress. As we are investing in our stores and our supply chain, we are also undertaking an enormous effort to strengthen what our guests already love about us, our products. Target\u2019s assortment has always been the star of the show. It\u2019s why we hear about the guest who comes in for one thing and leaves with a full cart. We know our style categories are typically at the heart of those stories.","Home and apparel deliver about $26 billion in sales, or more than a third of our business and continue to grow significantly faster than the rest of our assortment. But even with strong results, our team has seen the opportunity to more \u2013 to do more. Take what we did with Cat & Jack, the kids apparel brand we launched last year.","Our research told us we could capture more of the market, so we retired two pretty successful brands and developed something new to reflect the needs of both parents and kids. Since it rolled out in July, Cat & Jack has consistently delivered double-digit comp growth. It\u2019s on track to be become a billion-dollar brand in its first year with the potential to be the largest kids brand in the U.S. It wasn\u2019t just that we saw a new opportunity, it was how we went after it.","We took a holistic approach, making sure every touch point guests had with the brand, whether in-store or online was compelling, inspiring and easy to shop. While our stores featured product on mannequins and kid-sized fixtures, our site had a dedicated page that showcased Cat & Jack in a similar way, as a brand with outfits, not just a list of products and made it easy to shop by item. Both channels put the product front and center and our guests responded.","Store traffic increased, digital conversion rates shot up, baskets grew. We saw strong sales across the business. In fact, the digital brand pages were so successful, it\u2019s how we will present our products online going forward. We learned a lot about our guests, the potential in the market, and how we could use our platforms together to drive growth.","Now how many companies rolled out a new billion-dollar brand last year? I don\u2019t have a clue what the answer to that is, but I know it\u2019s not many. And now we\u2019re looking to do more.","When our new Chief Merchandising Officer, Mark Tritton, came on board last summer, he challenged the team to take the learnings from Cat & Jack and go further. They\u2019ve been looking at everything, all of our brands, and seeing where we have a lot of value and where we don\u2019t. They\u2019re talking to our guests to really understand what they want, and matching that up with where Target has a unique opportunity to stand out. Now, we are applying all of that in a really big way.","In the next two years, we will introduce more than a dozen new brands that Target guests will find only at Target. We\u2019ll touch more than $10 billion of current volume with the expectation that we\u2019ll accelerate growth within our most differentiated and profitable categories. And of course, our marketing team will bring them all to life in the magical way that only Target does.","Mark can give you plenty more color during Q&A. But I\u2019ll say that we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll appeal to current guests and attract new ones. So much of what we offer will feel completely fresh and it will be grounded in what our guests expect from Target, while helping them discover new styles and trends we know they will love.","Our exclusive brands have always been a huge differentiator. They are part of Target\u2019s DNA. This investment shows our commitment to making sure what has always driven guests to Target, like our great product at an incredible value will only keep getting better.","As you\u2019ve seen, nothing we\u2019re doing is specific to a channel, stores or digital. Everything we\u2019re building is a combination of the best of each channel, working together to provide a wholly seamless experience for our guests. We\u2019re transforming stores to help support our digital growth. We\u2019re building our supply chain to better \u2013 to enable better experience in-store and online, and we\u2019re thinking about our assortment from every angle, so guests are inspired no matter how they shop.","Now, we recognize that given our current results, where we are today, simply isn\u2019t good enough. And as we put in the work over the next few years, it\u2019s going to be a difficult journey. The investments we\u2019re making aren\u2019t simple and they aren\u2019t going to all pay off right away. But they are significant and they are ambitious, because we know that being successful requires playing the long game and that\u2019s the game we fully expect to win.","Cathy Smith","John\u2019s last point is spot on. Our current performance is not where we need it to be. So I want to start today with a progress report on the last couple of years, that will provide important context for where we are today. We have made significant progress on many of our strategies.","Signature categories have grown much faster than our overall sales, consistently gaining market share. Target\u2019s digital performance has outpaced the industry, averaging 29% over the last two years. We\u2019ve seen outstanding results in our new small formats, which generate much stronger sales productivity, healthy profit margins, and return on investment. We\u2019ve started investing to transform our supply chain.","Two years ago, fewer than 150 stores were shipping directly to guests. Today that\u2019s grown to more than 1,000 stores and counting. We\u2019ve made changes to allow our team to focus on our core business in the United States with our decisions to exit Canada and sell our pharmacy business, and the team has done an outstanding job of controlling costs. We beat our goal to take out a combined $2 billion of SG&A and cost of goods these last two years. And when you look back at our bottom line results, it\u2019s been a pretty good couple of years.","In 2014, we earned an adjusted EPS of $4.22. It grew to $5.01 in 2016. That amounts to an average annual growth of 9%. Over that same time period, we returned nearly $10 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. That solid performance better than many others have seen. Despite that progress, we haven\u2019t seen the growth we expected. On average, our comp sales have grown less than 1% over the last two years.","More importantly, instead of building momentum, we\u2019ve been seeing a slowdown. Specifically, our comp sales and our traffic have moved from growth in 2015 to declines this last year. Given these results and the rapidly changing environment, we must evolve our business model faster. By investing more aggressively, we can create a growth engine that will drive consistent, sustainable and profitable growth and market share gains.","The good news, we\u2019re not starting from scratch. We\u2019ve been investing in the right things. But it\u2019s clear, we need to pick up the pace and that will affect our financial model. As always, our first priority is to invest in our business with a long view. As we look ahead, we have a big opportunity to grow share in a world where others will be scaling back. Today, you\u2019ve heard in detail about the investments we\u2019re making to transform all aspects of our business including our digital capabilities, small formats, existing stores, supply chain, exclusive brands, and core capabilities like data and analytics.","To support these changes, we\u2019re planning to invest more than $2 billion of capital in 2017 and more than $7 billion over the next three years. In addition, we will invest about $1 billion of our operating profits this year. This will position us for faster growth over time. Our investments will include enhancing store service. We know it\u2019s critically important to provide a distinctive service in a world where consumers have more choices than ever.","We\u2019ll also see continued cost pressure from the rapid shift to digital. We will invest to develop and launch new brands with marketing support to make sure that they are top of mind for our consumers. And finally, we\u2019ll make gross margin investments to ensure we are always competitively priced everywhere and every day.","Unlike the last couple of years, we don\u2019t expect the margin headwinds and tailwinds to balance out this year. As we all know, we could make changes to maintain our margins through this transition. We could cut store service and cleanliness standards. We could pull back on marketing. We could stop investing in brands and cut back on their quality, and we could stop investing in our stores. Those changes would help our P&L in the short term, but they are absolutely the wrong long-term decisions.","Of course, we will continue to reduce costs on those non-critical efforts, but the right path is to invest in lower margins. This will allow us to grow and gain market share in the future. Target is in a really unique position. We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash generation, both provide us the flexibility to evolve our business model rapidly. In addition to our assets, we are well-positioned for this change.","First, consider our team, which has always been our greatest asset. We have long focused on hiring, training and retaining a store team that can provide a welcoming experience for our guests. And our team is already well-known for their guest service and fast checkout.","So today, as we take our new store experience to a higher level, our team is ready and excited to do more. We\u2019ll continue to give them new tools and empower them to manage their local businesses. Beyond our team, our unique assortment has always been an asset. It gives us the flexibility to present and curate all that our guests desire. And finally, consider our stores. They are more than 1,800 strong and a key competitive advantage. They\u2019re mostly off mall, they are very close to consumers, and they universally generate cash.","I want to pause here and talk about why our stores are so strong, especially at a time when others may not be so fortunate. We have long applied a rigorous process to decide where to build our stores, and we have an equally rigorous process to decide when it\u2019s time to close them. Every year we conduct a close-continue analysis on the entire store base, individually for each location. As a result, we have closed hundreds of locations over time. The key is discipline. It\u2019s the reason we have a very healthy portfolio of stores.","Looking ahead, our stores will still be the center of our business. But their roles will evolve. Within our smart network, stores will fulfill many roles. In addition to serving as a place where guests can shop in return they will also be a digital hub. They will provide online order pickup and deliver directly to guests, and importantly, they will continue to offer genuine human interaction and engage in their local communities.","As we navigate this transition, we\u2019ll continue to apply a disciplined returns-based approach to all of our investments. At the highest level, we are focused on sales growth with a relatively stable base of invested capital. We\u2019re focused on growing sales in all channels by transforming our assets, both our distribution centers and our stores. In addition, we will look for ways to streamline our asset base as our business evolves.","For example, as we increase the speed of our supply chain, we have a significant opportunity to reduce inventory without hurting our in-stocks. In the last two quarters, you\u2019ve seen the early signs of this trend. But we have a lot of opportunity to take inventory out of our network.","And finally, I want to emphasize that our priorities for capital deployment remain the same as they\u2019ve been for many years. First, we invest in our business with a long-term view. Second, we support our dividend. This year, we are on track to deliver our 46th straight year of annual dividend growth. And finally, we engage in share repurchase when we have excess cash beyond those first two uses.","We will manage our repurchase program within the limits of our credit rating. We may have some capacity during this transition period. But we won\u2019t be close to last year\u2019s pace, given the changes to our financial model. As I mentioned earlier, our strong balance sheet is providing valuable flexibility, especially during this key inflection point in our history. Looking ahead, maintaining this flexibility will be essential.","Now, let\u2019s turn briefly to our 2017 expectations, which were included in this morning\u2019s press release. At a high level, our guidance reflects a prudent view based on current trends and what we need to accomplish. Let\u2019s start with sales. We\u2019re planning for a low single-digit decline in comp sales this year. While this may not \u2013 while this is not where we want to be, we believe it\u2019s prudent based on a couple of key factors.","First, it reflects strong digital growth that has not fully offset declines in our stores. And it reflects the view that our investments will not have an immediate impact on our near-term performance. As I\u2019ve said many times, we stand ready to chase stronger comps when we have the opportunity. In the meantime, we will plan our business prudently.","On the EBIT line, this year we are planning to generate about $1 billion less than last year. This reduction reflects investments in enhanced store service, the continued shift into digital, support to develop, launch and market new exclusive brands, gross margin investment to ensure we are competitively priced, and additional D&A from investments in existing stores.","Now, I will give you some insights in how this will play out in our P&L this year. About half of the $1 billion investment will be on the SG&A line. Approximately $400 million will be on the gross margin line and the remaining pressure will be in D&A. Obviously, D&A is a non-cash expense, but this pressure will show up in the P&L. Altogether, we\u2019re planning for GAAP and adjusted EPS of $3.80 to $4.20. We know this is a meaningful departure from both our prior performance and expectations. But this change is essential to position our business for faster growth.","Now, let\u2019s turn briefly to our expectations for the first quarter. In February, we faced a challenging and choppy environment. We saw some improving trends near the and of the month. While that\u2019s encouraging, we believe it\u2019s prudent to plan for challenging trends to continue for the rest of the quarter.","As a result, we are planning for a low to mid-single-digit comp decline in the first quarter. This is the softest quarter comp that we are planning for the whole year. As a reminder, we are comping over our strongest quarter last year and our full-year outlook includes the benefit of store remodels and brand launches.","On the EBIT line, we are planning for a decline of about $400 million from last year. The majority of this decline will be on the gross margin line. Altogether, we\u2019re planning for both GAAP and adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $1. I know the magnitude of this change to our outlook is unexpected, but we must make these changes to position our business for the long-term.","Brian began the day by outlining the seismic shift we are seeing in the consumer and retail landscape. Our leadership team has spent a great deal of time studying what this shift means for Target. Because of that analysis, we are confident this is the right path forward. We\u2019re fortunate to have tested, prepared, and built a foundation over the last couple of years. Now it\u2019s time to accelerate the transformation of our business model.","Our goal today has been to clearly show you where we are investing in that new model. We are building a smart network that\u2019s more agile and reliable than ever before. A network that will be equally capable of inspiring and fulfilling physical and digital shopping. We are investing in stores that will look different and function differently than they do today. We are completely transforming our supply chain, becoming meaningful faster, more efficient and more accurate. And finally, we are delivering an even stronger portfolio of exclusive brands.","So now, before turn it back over to Brian, I want to spend a minute talking about what makes our approach different. We anticipate a lot of disruption in the retail landscape. We want to position ourselves to gain share as those changes occur. We\u2019ve seen a lot of stories this year, you\u2019ve seen a lot of stories this year. Retailers are closing stores and closing businesses across the country.","We are positioning our sales to play offense. We are going after that share market by market, but it\u2019s going to be a little noisy in the near-term. So at a time when many others are shrinking, we are investing. We are investing in two pillars of growth, our stores as multi-purpose assets within a smart network, and our digital capabilities as we continue to gain share in e-commerce.","Unlike the past, we are not providing explicit guidance beyond this year. I understand you have a desire for us to provide detailed longer-term guidance. However, given the amount of uncertainty we are facing, providing multi-year guidance would be a case of false precision. And given the transition we\u2019re planning, we believe it\u2019s important to focus on the company we will become.","With the investments we\u2019re making, we will be best positioned to deliver positive in-store comp sales and a rapid and profitable growing digital channel, stable to growing enterprise profit margins, continued strong cash flow, and the ability to return capital to shareholders, and superior ROIC over time. But let me be clear, this will be a multi-phase, multi-year journey. This year will be an investment phase, we\u2019ll move to lower margins to enable faster growth in the future.","Beyond this year, we will continue into a transition phase. We will invest capital to transform our supply chain, digital capabilities, new stores and existing stores. As we move past the transition, our new business and financial model will stabilize. And we\u2019ll deliver sustainable, reliable growth over time.","During the entire transition period, we will commit to transparency. Insights on our investments will serve as leading indicators of our future performance. Digital growth and the role of stores in fulfilling that demand, our pace of opening new stores with continued insight on their performance. Investments in existing stores and how those stores respond to those investments. Insight on how we are reducing delivery times and removing inventory from our supply chain. And finally, timing of new brand launches and how those brands perform.","Our company was founded over 100 years ago, and the first Target store opened more than 50 years ago. We are investing to position this company for success over the next 50 years. That\u2019s what we mean when we say we are taking the long view. Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Well, thank you, Cathy. So I know we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground this morning, but I\u2019d like to build on what Cathy just said. Target has been a great American retailer for more than 50 years. But our roots stretch back even further than that.","As many of you know, our company started out as Dayton\u2019s Dry Goods, just around the turn of the last century. That business evolved into a prominent chain of department stores, which led to a string of retail firsts, including the first indoor shopping mall, the first discount mass retailer. And later, the acquisition of Mervyns and Marshall Field. You know the story from there. Evolution is in our blood. And out of every period of disruption, our company has always forged ahead into the next era.","So when you think about what\u2019s in front of us, the seismic shift in consumer behavior that\u2019s disrupting our industry, we\u2019re doing what we\u2019ve always done. We\u2019re taking the long view, investing to compete, investing to grow, and we have the financial strength and the resources to build a new company. One that\u2019s poised to lead, positioned to win in this next-generation of retail. So look ahead three years from now.","We talked about what we will deliver, new stores, new formats, more than a dozen new brands, a coast-to-coast smart network enabled by new digital capabilities. To our guests, the entire experience will look and feel like a completely new Target. While many of our competitors are cutting costs and just trying to survive, we are doubling down. We know there will be meaningful opportunities to capture additional market share now and in the long-term.","So we\u2019re aggressively deploying capital to expand our reach, reimagine our physical stores, and transform our supply chain. We are investing in margin to accelerate and unlock even greater digital growth. We are investing in price to ensure, we\u2019re competitive across our assortment every day, both online and in-store. And we\u2019re investing in speed to move faster than we ever have before.","This is the plan that will produce the Target of the future. This is the plan that puts Target back on the path to profitable growth. This is the plan that will create shareholder value and deliver guest love and loyalty for many, many years to come.","So I want to close by thanking you for joining us this morning. And now I\u2019m going to invite John and Cathy, as well as Mike Tritton, our Chief Merchant, and Mike McNamara, our Chief Digital and Information Officer to join me onstage, so we can spend time taking your questions.","We\u2019ve got lots of mics, we\u2019ve got lots of time. So we\u2019ll try to work our way around the room. If you could, introduce yourselves this morning, I would appreciate that and we\u2019re happy to take your questions. So why don\u2019t we start right up front.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. Chris Horvers with JPMorgan, thanks for having the meeting. Trying to dig a little bit into the gross margin pressure understand in the first quarter you\u2019re going to have some pressure from markdowns and clearance. But then over the balance of the year some channel shift pressure, as well as price investments. Can you talk about the latter, what you\u2019re expecting in terms of gross margin pressure from the digital and pricing pressures?","Will pricing largely be a reset in 2017, and then we sort of neutralize from there, and is it your expectation over time that the supply chain improvements ultimately stabilize the gross margin and is that 2018 event? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Yes, Chris, let me talk about the pricing investments we are making. And I think as most of you know, coming out of the data breach, we invested heavily in promotions. As we go forward, we\u2019re going back to our roots and reestablishing our everyday low-price commitment, so that\u2019s going to take some time. It\u2019s starting today. We\u2019re going to make sure, we reestablish our value with the guests.","So there\u2019s an investment we have to make. And we also recognize we have to continue to invest in digital to grow that channel to continue to make sure we are accelerating market share. So you are going to see us invest in 2017.","As John talked about, we expect greater efficiencies over time. One, as we continue to optimize our digital performance, but importantly, as we transform our supply chain. But in the short-term, we have to compete. We have to invest to make sure, we\u2019re delivering the value the guest is looking for. We want to make sure, we\u2019re taking market share, both in-store and online, and we think those are two very important investments in the near-term that provide long-term benefits for the company.","Michael Lasser","Hi, it\u2019s Michael Lasser from UBS.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Michael Lasser","Thanks, Brian. I think the key question is, we all appreciate that you don\u2019t want to provide long-term guidance. But how long are you anticipating it\u2019s going to take for you to see a return on all the investments that you\u2019re making? Is it reasonable to expect that you\u2019re going to return to earnings growth in 2018, 2019? When should we expect that?","Brian Cornell","I\u2019ll go back to my what Cathy talked about a few minutes ago. We certainly view 2017 as a year of investment. In 2018, we\u2019ll continue to transition as these different initiatives begin to mature. As we get into 2019 and beyond, we certainly expect stability and a return to growth.","So that\u2019s the model we\u2019re looking at. We can\u2019t laid out for you quarter-by-quarter. We want to make sure, we\u2019re properly investing and accelerating these initiatives. And if there\u2019s a message I want everyone to walk away with today, these aren\u2019t new initiatives. We\u2019ve been working on these for several years.","Now it\u2019s time for us to go faster. And this is about accelerating at the right place for our business. But whether it\u2019s our digital channel, the work John talked about in the supply chain, the acceleration of remodeling our existing stores and reimagining that experience, or opening up these new smaller formats, we\u2019ve got to step on the accelerator. And as they mature, we\u2019re going to return to growth. We\u2019re going to capture market share, and we\u2019re certainly going to see the benefits that our shareholders are looking for. Craig?","Craig Johnson","Craig Johnson with Customer Growth Partners. Brian, I understand the importance and necessity of the reset you talked about doing here today. I want to look forward to how do you get back to growth and one pillar of growth is, of course, traffic growth, hallmark of all great retailers is consistent traffic growth and you showed two of them earlier, Costco and TJX [indiscernible] and Home Depot. The question is, could you get more granular on how you can actually rebuild share of trip missions as a way of getting share traffic?","Brian Cornell","Craig, it\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s embedded in everything we talked about today. So the reinvestment in our stores, reimagining over the next few years hundreds of hundreds of stores. We certainly learn in our test in both Los Angeles, as we\u2019ve remodeled stores in Texas that as we bring in new experience that drives traffic to our stores.","As Mark and his team continue to roll out these new proprietary brands that are unique to Target, that drives traffic to both our stores and our site. And we\u2019ve seen that with Cat & Jack, a billion-dollar brand in year one on its way to being the number one kids brand in America. So as we continue to elevate brands, those drive traffic to both our stores and our site. As we move into our new urban neighborhoods, it\u2019s striving for traffic every single day.","So and as we think about how this smart network comes together, brands play an important role that in-store experience is critically important being in the right neighborhoods, but then we also know from a digital standpoint more and more of our guests are ordering online and conveniently coming to our stores to pick up that order. That allows us to really make sure that once they\u2019re in our store, they continue to shop.","So all of these elements are all about driving traffic to our stores and more visits to our site. And as they mature, that\u2019s certainly going to be one of the key metrics that we will all be tracking.","Robert Ohmes","Hi, Brian, Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. As a follow-up to that question, can we get you guys to talk a little bit more about the category outlooks. So how you\u2019re thinking about price investments in terms of food and consumables versus apparel and electronics, et cetera? And also for the new brands maybe some more insight, what categories you are thinking about launching some of these 12 new brands? And just a quick for Cathy, I guess, I might have missed if I didn\u2019t understand, are you \u2013 you\u2019ve been disciplined about store closings, but is there a change in your pace of store closings? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Yes, good. So let me start with price let Mark talk about brands and Cathy can talk about our real estate portfolio. And I think you answered the question for us. As we think about the investments we\u2019re making in price, we\u2019ll start with those core essential and food categories, those strip drivers that Craig just referred to. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we move from a promotional cadence back to our traditional every day low price and great value every time the guest shops in those core personal care, household essential and food categories.","We\u2019ll certainly make sure, we\u2019re revisiting price across the box. But it certainly starts with making sure, we are priced right on those trip driving items that our guest depend on Target for every day. Mark, why don\u2019t you talk about some of the brand work.","Mark Tritton","Yes. As we rolled out the new brand work, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019re looking at guest insights about what brands and what spices we should play in. But more importantly, what is the sweet spot on pricing for regular everyday pricing. So as we reset these brands, we\u2019re going to be defining great value every day for our guests as we introduce in every niche in the business","Cathy Smith","Robby, I\u2019ll quickly address store portfolio. As we said, we\u2019ve had a very disciplined process for \u2013 however, the team has done a great job. And so our pace doesn\u2019t change. We\u2019ve been closing about 10 to 15 source a year, that\u2019s been consistent year-in and year-out, we\u2019ll continue to do that. But that just normal course for us. We look at every store every year and say does it make sense to keep open. And today, the answer is yes, universally generate positive cash","Brian Cornell","Yes. Cathy, on the store front just to close that out. And I know we talked about it during our prepared remarks, but our store portfolio is not mall-based.","Cathy Smith","Yes.","Brian Cornell","We\u2019re in some of the centers, where most of the retailers are trying to migrate to. So we\u2019re very fortunate that over time we built 1,800 stores that are effectively located, that are in the right neighborhoods, that are not off remotely on interstates. They\u2019re not tied to dying malls.","So we have an obligation to revitalize in those stores and reimage those stores. But one of the things that we\u2019re most confident about is, we have an exceptional store portfolio. So as we invest, as we bring those stores up to the expectation our guest has for Target, we expect those to drive traffic and continue to flourish in the years to come.","Matthew McClintock","Hi. Yes, Matt McClintock from Barclays. So clearly, the store today is about investment, right? You need to make substantial investments. And as I look back at the past two years, you\u2019ve fallen shy of your capital plan by s significant amount, right?. So as I look forward, one, can you help me understand where the shortfall to the capital plan was this past year?","Two, would you attribute some of the weakness today that you\u2019re seeing to some of the lack of investment or shortfall to your capital plans?","And then three, is the $2 billion enough for 2017, given that it falls to the low-end of your prior long-term guidance of $2 billion to $2.5 billion?","Brian Cornell","Matt, I\u2019d start out by talking about the last couple of years as being a time of very disciplined capital allocation. We\u2019ve taken a very surgical approach to some of these initiatives. We\u2019ve remodeled 25 stores in Los Angeles. We\u2019ve been testing and learning and iterating and improving the expectation that the guest has, making sure we deliver against that. Now that we\u2019ve gotten the feedback, we\u2019re ready to accelerate.","John talked about, we opened up 32 small formats, not 300. We study each one of those very carefully to make sure we understood how to customize them for new local neighborhoods. Now that we understand the expectation we are ready to accelerate. From a capital standpoint, we actually benefited from the fact that Mike has taken a very disciplined approach to setting priorities within technology and we\u2019ve seen phenomenal improvement in our platforms, our capabilities at a lower cost.","So our approach to capital has been very disciplined. We\u2019ve been testing and validating and learning. Now that the learning is complete, we are ready to accelerate those investments. But we have been very disciplined. John talked about supply chain. We know the changes that we need to make, but we have been very surgical, very disciplined and putting together that playbook. Now that it\u2019s in place, we\u2019ll begin to accelerate.","So from a capital standpoint, we\u2019ll continue to make sure, we\u2019re very thorough. We test and validate. But once we\u2019ve completed the learning, we\u2019ll be ready to accelerate and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing as we think about the next three years.","Peter Benedict","Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. I was hoping you could maybe speak a little bit more detail about the view of grocery that\u2019s out of the stores, how is that going to look and reimagine store? And then, Cathy, maybe a little view as to how much it costs to do the remodels and how long it takes? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Yes. Why don\u2019t I start and I will let Mark talk about some of the progress we\u2019ve seen on grocery. And while we didn\u2019t spend a lot of time on it today, I want to make sure it\u2019s very clear. We\u2019re very focused on improving our grocery performance. But we haven\u2019t just been standing still. We\u2019ve made significant progress in procurement, in supply chain, in making sure we\u2019ve improved our assortment, in making sure in those test stores in Los Angeles and Dallas, we understand the changes that need to be made in the in-store experience.","We\u2019re going to follow it up immediately with the right investment in pricing to make sure we are competitively priced every day in those key categories. So we\u2019ve got more work to do. We\u2019re certainly not satisfied with where we are. But we have been making some progress and there\u2019s bright spots, Mark, that I think you can talk to.","Mark Tritton","Yes, just looking at the format, fresh produce is a really good example. We\u2019ve changed our supply chain, our assortment, and are focused on quality and value. So investing there has really made a different where the guest has really perceived and responded to with great quality in key categories. So here we\u2019ve invested in fresh and we\u2019ve gone from an organization that used to deliver multi-times a week to every single day increasing the freshness and quality and guests are responding.","Some of the tests that Brian talked about in LA and Dallas have really paid dividends for us. And one great example of that is the our adult beverage business, where we\u2019ve seen great quality in 2016, and we\u2019re going to amplify that growth and accelerate in 2017. This is a business that for us was a number one growth category throughout all Target and we see an upside of $1 billion business here that we\u2019re fast tracking on in 2017.","Joseph Feldman","Joe Feldman, Telsey Advisory Group, we\u2019re in the back, sorry. I wanted to follow-up on that. Can you talk a little bit on the merchandising side areas of the store that maybe expanding or contracting, and then a little more specifically about those dozen brands that you\u2019re going to be adding in. What categories with those be in and what are the \u2013 any preview you can give us and how to think about that?","Brian Cornell","Mark?","Mark Tritton","Yes, so the key focus of the brand growth is really and what we talked about with John in our key strength there is apparel accessories, footwear and home. So there\u2019s a high margin and high strength areas for us. And we believe that Target has a right DNA on exclusivity and differentiation. I guess, love our brands and have loved them. But we\u2019ve been a little slow here in terms of the changing place of the guest. And I guess, inside store that we could sharpen that and bring you new ideas.","Great proof-of-concept in 2016 with the launch of who, what, where, Pillowfort and of course, Cat & Jack. This showed us where we were placed at strengths with a new focus and we could create double-digit comps and guests love and trips for our store. So we\u2019ve taken key areas across men\u2019s women\u2019s, home and kids and I\u2019m going to amplify our office there and redefine.","In terms of overall space, we\u2019re just utilizing our existing space and really refreshing that. So one of the things we\u2019re excited about in 2017, this combination of new brands, capital investment in the space for those brands, but also the addition of extra resources like visual merchandising. They\u2019re really going to create a new experience for the guest in-store and create real excitement.","Mark Miller","All right. Thank you. Mark Miller with Crystal Rock Capital. You talked earlier about making price investments across essentials. I wanted to ask what do you think is the risk that you\u2019ve taken too much margin on exclusive items, UPT has come down, but average ticket has gone up with price per item. So I thought also it maybe helpful if you could share market research on the customer\u2019s perception and value on exclusives now versus several years ago? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Yes, why don\u2019t I start. And I think the proof is in the results we\u2019ve delivered. Outstanding results, as we talked about with the launch of Pillowfort. The same thing has been very true with Cat & Jack. So I think this is an example where we\u2019ve got the value equation right. Great quality, on trend at a great value and the guest response has been terrific. So that\u2019s the same approach Mark is going to take with each one of those new brands making sure, we combined great quality items that are on trend for the consumer with the right value that drives trips, but also make sure that the guest recognizes, they are getting great value from Target. So coming back to our brand promise, we expect more and pay less. Those elements have to work hand-in-hand with our new brands going forward.","Kate McShane","Hi, Kate McShane on Citi Investment Research. I have two unrelated questions today, one, a short-term question and one, a longer-term question. With regards to your guidance for the year, I\u2019m wondering how much in terms of your competitor to work closer are in your assumptions for guidance?","And second on the longer-term question for supply chain, just curious it was a year ago that you walked us through some of the changes in your supply chain. I\u2019m just wondering how much the game has changed since the last time we have heard about that strategy and how you\u2019re approaching the last mile?","Brian Cornell","John, do you want to start with supply chain and I\u2019ll finish up with guidance.","John Mulligan","Sure. I think the past year we spent doing really two things in supply chain. One was just optimizing what we do today to improve out of stock in-store, which have been a chronic problem for us. They have improved dramatically. They\u2019re not where they need to be, but they have improved.","The second thing we focused on is right to the heart of your second \u2013 your question, which is had we optimize the entirety of our supply chain, go back and relook at everything to one, take work out of the store and two, be much more efficient in how we deliver and especially on the last mile.","We spent the last couple of years expanding our ship from store capability. We have believed for a long time that it\u2019s the single best advantage we have in the supply chain is our store network. It puts us right next to the guest. And what we\u2019re working on today is, how we move inventory more efficiently and more quickly in each is, because that is what is required for direct to guest out to the stores and then from the store directly to the guest and do that quickly.","You will see us this year, they said start to make those changes in the Northeast. Several pilots are already underway that have been significantly improved our speed to guest. And as I said, we\u2019ll \u2013 as Cathy said, we\u2019ll continue to come back and report on how we\u2019re doing. But that is the heart of what we\u2019re doing. That becomes the basis for improving everything Mike can do is giving him flexibility to put services on top and to deliver at whatever speed the guest wants and the store like to back up, that could be today.","Hey, I came in picked up my five things, I\u2019m going to go run some errands with the kids, deliver those to my house in three hours. It could also mean, hey, bring this to my house in 10 days, this patio set, bring it to the back of my house, set it up and do trash it and take the garbage away. So it\u2019s really about flexibility and speed allowing the guest to choose how they want to interact with us, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re building the platform of our supply chain around.","John Mulligan","Maybe why don\u2019t I start by talking about the competitive landscape and what Cathy talked about the guidance. But to your point, we certainly see over the next few years significant market share opportunities, as we see the contraction in our competitive store base. And that\u2019s going to be particularly true in the apparel and home spaces, where we\u2019re strongest. But we also recognize as you do, as many retailers are closing stores, if not exiting the business. The short-term implication is massive promotional discounts, which takes consumers out of the marketplace for a period of time.","So over the long haul, this is a growth story we\u2019re putting together. We think we are going to see significant market share opportunities across a number of categories. To capture that, we need to make sure we\u2019ve got the right in-store experience and a very strong and easy digital experience for that guest. But in the near-term, you\u2019re going to see deep discounting. You\u2019re going to see liquidation sales, which takes prices down and takes consumer trips out of the marketplace. But over time, we see significant market share opportunities.","Cathy Smith","Yes, the only thing I would add on to that, because that\u2019s where I was going to go to is we are absolutely investing to be able to play offense. We see this as a huge opportunity for Target when you think about the Plainfield that\u2019s going to be available. And so we are investing to play offense. But I don\u2019t anticipate and we don\u2019t anticipate that to be demonstrably changing this year. This year is an investment year for us, as we set ourselves up for that great success to take the share over the next multiple years. There\u2019s going to be a ton of disruption in the space.","Daniel Binder","Okay. Dan Binder with Jefferies. I had a few questions. First, there has been a few questions on food today, I\u2019m curious as you think about the role of food and at your competitors, it\u2019s been used as a traffic driver. Today, we\u2019re not really hearing that from you, you\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re hearing more about remodels and brands outside. So can you just talk a little bit about why you think food shouldn\u2019t be the traffic driver for you and why you shouldn\u2019t be reallocating space away from dying categories to expand the food assortment?","And my second question is, can you make money online longer-term? And why doesn\u2019t the marketplace makes sense for you as a \u2013 particularly, as a source of fee income to offset and maybe some of the pressure in your own business?","Brian Cornell","So why don\u2019t I start by talking about food and let Mark add some additional color and then give Mike a chance to talk about our digital approach going forward. One of the things that we\u2019ve talked about over the last year, as it pertains to Target\u2019s food and beverage offering is the recognition that we don\u2019t have a full service grocery experience. We don\u2019t have meat and seafood counters. We don\u2019t have deli counters. We don\u2019t provide a full assortment of experiences and services that many of our full-line competitors do.","But we can offer a great self-service convenient experience. And that starts with the right quality, the right assortment, the right in-store experience, great value, we\u2019ve got to make sure we are supplying those products to our guests every single day to make sure the freshness is there.","So we are embracing who we are. And we want to make sure the guest knows that while they are shopping at Target, there\u2019s no compromise. We\u2019ve got to build trust. We\u2019ve got to make sure that while they are there shopping for their baby, picking up a toy for a Saturday night birthday party, picking up something new to wear for dinner that night, they have confidence in the selection and breath of food products we offer.","So we\u2019re being treated who we are and we\u2019re not a full service grocery. We don\u2019t have rotisserie ovens in our stores. But we do have the right allocation of space and selection to compete in the \u2013 that convenient alternative in food and we\u2019re going to build on that going forward.","We\u2019re very pleased with the response we\u2019ve seen in Los Angeles in Dallas, where we enhanced that experience, where we improved the assortment. The reaction, as Mark talked about to categories like craft beer and wine, that fit in very well with the Target guest. So we\u2019ve got to strengthen that offering, make sure we\u2019ve got great quality, the right assortment, that we\u2019ve got the right experience in-store, and that we provide the right value the guest is looking for.","So we\u2019ll continue to build off of that going forward and make sure that while our guests are shopping Target, there also shopping our food and beverage offering.","Mark Tritton","Yes, I think I spice to say, but not talking about flipping or divesting or investing more spice, how we utilize the spice more definitively. And I think that what we\u2019ve learned in these test markets is the role of fresh and convenience in creating trips and creating guest royalty has been very powerful. So reformatting the space and really curating the assortment is more of what we\u2019re focused on rather than whole sort of changes to macro space.","Brian Cornell","Mike, why don\u2019t you talk about where we are with digital?","Michael McNamara","Sure.","Brian Cornell","We spent very little time talking about our performance in 2016. We felt great about how we exited the year, comps up 34%, making really good progress. Mike, we doubled the business in the last couple of years. So why don\u2019t you talk about where we are and where we\u2019re going.","Michael McNamara","Look, I think particularly in the last year the \u2013 our focus has been on guest experience and coming \u2013 making a great guest experience. And while some of those investments may not have been obvious, they have pay dividends. We grew the business at almost twice the rate of the market last year. John talked about earlier how we expanded our ship from store capability, which has been really, really important to us.","We shipped about 1 million parcels to our guests in the two days following Cyber Monday. And that\u2019s really important, because that is our cheapest route to the guest at home is shipping from our stores. And as we can expand that model, we can be closer to our guests physically and in time and we have the lead time during the holiday period to guest as well.","So all of those investments have improved the guest experience. We\u2019ve almost doubled our guest satisfaction rating over the course of the year whilst we grew the business at twice the rate of the market. And we see that again going into this year. So there will be a relentless focus on the guest experience going forward. All the work that John and his team are doing to reconfigure our supply chain will give us a lead time advantage and a cost advantage as we deliver more and more parcels to our guest store \u2013 to our guest stores.","The work that Mark is doing on assortment and creating exclusive product, exclusive brand for Target that isn\u2019t available anywhere else will be vital to our online merchandising going forward. We will always look at other ways maybe of how we would expand our assortment online. But right now, we\u2019ve got our sites fairly firmly focused on how we can get to guess quicker, how we can exclude flawlessly, and how we can bring exclusive brand and product to our guests.","Brian Cornell","Right up front.","Bryan Cameron","Good morning. This is Bryan Cameron, Dodge & Cox. Thank you for your presentation this morning. With all the seismic shifts that are going on in retail as you outlined and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve considered other strategic alternatives to the once you outlined this morning, what were some of those alternatives and why is when you outline you think the best for the company going forward?","Brian Cornell","Bryan, we spent a lot of time as a leadership team looking at different alternatives. There was only one path forward and that\u2019s the path we\u2019ve chosen. We\u2019ve got to invest to grow. We\u2019ve got to reimagine our stores. We\u2019ve got to enter new neighborhoods as we\u2019re doing with these small formats. We\u2019ve got to transform our supply chain. We have to build out the digital capabilities required in this environment. We have to continue to elevate our proprietary brands. And I think most importantly, we just have to embrace the realities of this new era of retailing and make sure that we also embrace the way consumers are shopping today.","So we certainly debated whether there are other options. Every time we came to the table, there was only one conclusion and it\u2019s a path we\u2019ve chosen to follow. We think this is the right path for our company, the right path for our shareholders, and ultimately it\u2019s a path back to growth and an expansion to market share. So we\u2019ve done our homework. We\u2019ve looked at this from every different angle. This was the path we kept coming back to. It\u2019s the right path for the company today. It will be the right path for the company 10 years from now.","Greg Gregory","Hi, it\u2019s Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Three questions, I\u2019ll make them quick into one. Cathy, does the guidance for this year assume the comps term positive by the fourth quarter?","Second, is on CapEx. When we look at that $7 billion budget over the next three years, if you could break that down into existing stores, new stores, supply chain and give us a sense of where the money is actually going?","And then lastly and maybe, I don\u2019t know who this is for, but for everyone, I guess, Brian, what will you be watching to know that this is working. So that basically we want to double down, or not, or the go the other way towards the end of the year. Specifically, there\u2019s an interesting comment you made that our cheapest way to fulfill his through the store. I would love just to hear \u2013 that sort of shocks me, given what we\u2019re seeing Amazon do and others. So just why is that true for Target and maybe not true for some of the others?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Greg, why don\u2019t I start with the metrics the things we\u2019re going to be watching closest. And it\u2019s going to come back to \u2013 we\u2019re going to watch the guest, as the guest respond when we reimagine a store. How do they respond when we move into new neighborhoods? How do they respond to our new digital offerings. How do they respond as we roll out new brands?","So ultimately, that guest satisfaction and I guess both is the most important one. And when they are in our stores more frequently and visiting our site more frequently and shopping with Target versus other retailers, we know we are winning. But we\u2019re going to clearly monitor the guest reaction, as we remodeled these next hundred stores in 2017, and we continue to accelerate with another 30 small formats.","And as Mark introduces new brands throughout 2017 and Mike enhances our digital offering, it\u2019s going to come back to the guest reaction. And we are fighting for footsteps, we\u2019re fighting for clicks online and we\u2019re fighting for a share of mine. So for this to be a growth story, it is all about gaining market share and that starts with building greater trust, greater loyalty with our guest. So we will be watching that each and every day across these initiatives we\u2019ve laid out today.","Cathy Smith","Yes. So, Brian, maybe I can address the other two questions, Greg. This is a multi-phase, multi-year journey. And so and we try to make sure we set that expectation, we are recognizing that the environment is going to be disruptive. And we\u2019ve got a ton of work still to do although we\u2019re not starting from scratch. We\u2019re going to accelerate that pace and that investments.","And so we are not and we guided that in our guidance, planning for anything, but low single-digit negative declines this year. And that\u2019s what we said it\u2019s an investment year as we move into transition and we will get into stability where we can sustainably consistently drive profitable growth and market share gains. And so I want to make sure we do set that expectation appropriately.","On your question with regards to how the capital allocation is being spent over the $7 billion investment over the next three years, it\u2019s really in the three areas that Brian just talked about, it\u2019s the three big areas, the biggest one is being obviously as we reimagine our stores as they will still be central to our story, their roles will evolve, but they will be significant investments there as well as the new stores, supply chain and digital, and that\u2019s exactly where you would expect us to be spending that money.","Brian Cornell","Yes. Mike, why don\u2019t we come back to the shipping question?","Michael McNamara","Yes. I mean, the reality is that in the digital business, one of your biggest cost, biggest marginal cost is transportation, and it is cheaper for us to drive, or to deliver from our stores, which are, as we said, about 10 miles and 75% of the population. So that last leg being very shorter, makes it our cheapest option. The marginal cost of us getting product to the stores on the back of our existing network that already to the distribution center is already out there is very, very low for us indeed. So the additional cost on that last mile is very low. We also have, of course, order pickup, which is probably our most economic fulfillment channel.","Brian Cornell","Okay. Why don\u2019t we \u2013 Oliver has been very patient waiting here, your arm, why don\u2019t we see if we can get him a microphone.","Oliver Chen","Thank you very much. Oliver Chen, Cowen and Company. I have a question related to the topic of fill-in versus stock up tactically in terms of what you\u2019re thinking about the future of fill-in and the opportunity there?","And longer-term, as you do your consumer insights on millennials and generation Z, what do you think the five-year story is for reimagining the store as you think about what the newest customers really want to see with disruption in transformation?","And finally, on the topic of Big Data and data sciences, how does that interplay with how we should think about the model over the longer-term, and what does that mean for what consumers want versus where you can deliver data science, where it be supply chain, omni-channel, or predictive analytics giving people something they don\u2019t even know they want? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Oliver, let\u2019s try to unpack those questions. Let me start with the last one, as we think about the role of data science and analytics. And I made the comment that three years ago this was a nascent capability for us. It\u2019s now quickly become one of the strength of the company. And we\u2019re applying that across all of our various functions. It\u2019s helping Mark and his merchant team make better choices. It\u2019s certainly enabling some of the work that John is leading from a supply chain standpoint. It\u2019s influencing how we lead and manage our stores. And Mike can talk about the important role it plays as we think about digital and the personalization of our communication.","So data science is going to play an important role across all of our functions going forward to make the company focused on the right decisions, smarter decisions, more personalized decisions. And Mike, why don\u2019t you talk about the role that has played just recently, as we think about digital and how we\u2019re interfacing with the guest?","Michael McNamara","Well, I think, as Brian said, this is an important \u2013 it\u2019s a very important growing area for us. I\u2019ve been here \u2013 data sciences came out in Sunnyvale with over 40 PhDs who are doing nothing, but thinking of the clever ways to how we tune our supply chain and how we personalize the offer to our guests, particularly online. One recent improvement they\u2019ve made is on some of the bottom recommendations that we gave on our homepage. And we\u2019ve seen an eightfold improvement on conversion rate on that.","So we do know that as you make that experience and more relevance to the guests that we will improve our sales online, it will improve our conversion rates. That\u2019s just one example. And I\u2019ve seen a lot of examples in John\u2019s area around how we are improving sales forecasting and our ordering algorithms, which has helped the flow of stock all the way through our supply chain.","Brian Cornell","Let me try to come back to your question around the consumer trends, the role of the millennial and how that takes shape over the next three to five years. And as we look at it today, I\u2019ll start with the investment we\u2019re making in our stores. And as we\u2019ve looked at the outlook, as you\u2019ve done the math, while we expect this continued accelerated shift to digital, stores are still going to be very important. And pick the number three years from now, the stores represent 85, or 80, or 75% of the business. I don\u2019t know?","But even if there are 75% of the business three to five years fro now, there\u2019s still the dominant portion. Again, what we know every time we talk to the consumer, every time we talk to the guest, they crave experience. Yet they\u2019re going to shop the physical store, they wanted to be a great experience. So we\u2019ve seen the reaction to the changes we\u2019ve made with visual merchandising.","Some of the things that Mark and his team are bringing to life every day in our stores in our apparel and home categories. We want to make sure it\u2019s a great experience. If they\u2019re using our stores as a smart pickup point, we need to make sure when they come to our stores, they are greeted by phenomenal team members who can quickly find their order and invite them to shop more often.","So we\u2019ve got to make sure that the experience is critically important in our stores. We know going forward that millennial consumer that we serve, they are going to be digitally connected and their shopping experiences are likely always going to start with the digital device then they will choose whether they wanted deliver to their front door, they want to pick it up, or they just want to make sure they know where the products are placed inside of that Target store in their neighborhood.","So we\u2019ve got to embrace the way consumers are shopping. But we recognize when they come to a physical store, they expect a great experience. When they shop online, they wanted to be really easy. When they come to pick up a product at one of our 1,800 stores, they\u2019ve got to make sure the product is there. We\u2019ve got the right items and we invite them to enjoy the convenience that we did the shopping for them, now they can take the next 20 minutes and explore the store and discover and enjoy the merchandise that we have to offer.","So physical stores will continue to be important. But we\u2019ve got to reimagine the store experience. Today\u2019s millennial shopper doesn\u2019t enjoy shopping one of our tired stores that hasn\u2019t been touched in 10 years. But they love the reimagined stores and they give us that feedback as weak remodel stores in Los Angeles and we reimagine stores in Dallas, whereas we open up new flex formats. The feedback we are receiving is sensational. And they use those flex formats, those smaller stores as places to fill in, but they\u2019re filling in two, three times a week.","So we are looking at it very carefully. But we know stores will be very important, but it\u2019s going to be part of our smart network, where we combined the digital experience, the store experience as one and make it really easy for the guest to connect with Target anytime they want, anyway they want in their local neighborhoods and towns.","Brandon Fletcher","Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein. We see your competitive advantage in assortment and service. So when you talk about new brands, we love it. When you talk about service online and create a ordering, matching online, awesome. Doing the picking from DCs for each as is genius, and I think only you and Home Depot are close there. The only place we get nervous is, when you say things about pricing convenience, I\u2019ve sat across the way for many CEOs who are desperately trying to drive traffic with price investments when they were not below cost operator. And it just doesn\u2019t usually work. And if you\u2019re seeing debt in department stores and retailers in subscale groceries, where you guys are already way better on price, are you really sure you need to invest that heavily?","And then secondly, is with the roll outs to new projects touches in stores, will folks with disconfirming evidence have as much access to leadership as those with confirming evidence you guys have been extremely disciplined in the way you did LA 25, but it\u2019s hard to get right? So those are the two questions.","Brian Cornell","Let\u2019s go back to pricing. Let me make sure that we are really clear about what we\u2019re doing and why. And we spent a lot of time looking at the changes that we had made following the breach. And we were very promotional. And that promotional intensity has continued. As we go into 2017, you\u2019re going to see us get back to our roots, get back to establishing every day low pricing in those essential categories. There will be a transition period, but it\u2019s really going back to it\u2019s always worked for us in the past and moving away from that promotional intensity, the reliance on big promotions to making sure we give our guests the confidence and trust that every day they shop in our stores for those core essential items, they\u2019re getting a great value.","So it\u2019s a transition. There\u2019s an investment involved in that, but it\u2019s really getting back to us made as straight going in the past and really making sure that\u2019s part of what we bring going forward. So we\u2019ll continue to be very disciplined. As we talk about the question about capital allocation, we\u2019re still going to be a company that will continue to innovate, innovation is very important and innovation is alive and well at Target.","But we\u2019re going to make sure, we test, we learn, we validate, and the innovation has to benefit our core enterprise. It has to translate to driving more traffic to our stores, more trips to our site, greater guest loyalty and engagement. So innovation will be an important part of our future. We\u2019ll do it as we\u2019ve done in the past in a very disciplined way. When things don\u2019t work, we\u2019ll shut them down. When we need to iterate, we will continue to iterate and learn. And when we validated the model, we\u2019ll step on the accelerator as we are right now and we\u2019ll move forward quickly. I guess, we\u2019ve got time for one only last question. Why don\u2019t we go over here. Scott?","Scott Mushkin","Hey, thank you. Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. So I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. One is, just a clarification on the cost of the remodels, I don\u2019t think we actually got that number and I was wondering if we can get. I was hoping for an update on store execution specifically in-stock, I know that was a big focus?","And the final question would be around price investments. You have two large competitors driving down price most notably Walmart, but also Amazon is doing a lot of work with the subscriber save and those prices are very low. So what gives you the confidence that it\u2019s one in done here as it one of your largest competitors on a multi-year price lowering campaign? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","John, you want to start with stores and I will come back and talk about pricing.","John Mulligan","Yes, just check off really quick customer remodel for prototype, what we call, a P store $5.5 million a little less for more volume stores, little more for higher volume stores, super Target, what do you think Cathy about double?","Cathy Smith","Yes, they\u2019re little less than double.","John Mulligan","Little less than double. Store execution, I\u2019d say two things about. One on out of stocks, we have a lot of progress. When we were talking about it last year, they had improved by about 40% last year, almost another 15% improvement. We\u2019ve seen significant improvement in doing what we do today. The next LEAP in improvements in out-of-stocks and our stores will come from fundamentally changing the supply chain, which is what we talked about today. And so that\u2019s on course that we will keep working on and we\u2019ll update you as we go forward, I guess.","Brian Cornell","And so, I will finish by talking less about price and a lot more about value. We know we have to be competitively priced every day on those core essentials. But we win when we deliver a compelling value, which means a great in-store experience, which means new exciting brands, which means surrounding the guest with great team members, which means a great online experience that\u2019s easy and friction free.","So it can\u2019t be just about price. It has to be about value. And value is a combination of all the things we do and historically have done so well. So we want to make sure we surround the guest with a great in-store experience. The reaction we\u2019ve seen as we brought visual merchandising and life in our stores has been fantastic. We\u2019ve got to continue to build compelling brands that deliver great value for the guests. We\u2019ve got to surround them with a great experience, whether they are picking up an item, or checking out on our stores, and that\u2019s got to translate to how we interface with the guests online.","So value is critically important. And we think we\u2019re positioned in a way that\u2019s unique in the industry, with our assortment, our in-store experience, our multi-category, portfolio, the capabilities we\u2019ve now built online and the changes we\u2019re making in-store. That\u2019s what gives us too much confidence that we\u2019re on the path back to growth. That it will take time, but there\u2019s going to be significant market share opportunities in front of us.","And three years from now when we\u2019ve reimagined stores and we are in new neighborhoods and we\u2019ve rolled out new brands and we\u2019ve added great new supply chain capability to complement what we\u2019ve done from a digital standpoint, we will be sitting here talking about the new Target, a growth company that\u2019s captured market share in this new era of retailing.","Brian Cornell","So I appreciate your time and your patience today. Thanks for joining us and we look forward to talking to in the future. So thank you."],"20390":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q3 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call November 18, 2015 10:30 AM ET","Executives","John Hulbert - Vice President, IR","Brian Cornell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","John Mulligan - Chief Operating Officer","Cathy Smith - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus","Kate McShane - Citi Research","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 18, 2015.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President - Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Brian will discuss our third quarter performance including results across our merchandise categories and plans for the fourth quarter and remainder of the year; then John will provide an update on our operations and priorities going forward; and finally, Cathy will offer more detail on our third quarter financial performance and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Following the remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his perspective on our third quarter performance. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. As we step back and look at our third quarter results and our year-to-date performance, it\u2019s clear that our strategy is working and we\u2019re delivering on the financial commitments we laid out last March. Following an extended period of declines, traffic has turned positive over the last four quarters and it\u2019s been accelerating on a two-year basis.","Sales in signature categories have been growing much faster than our overall sales, and they\u2019re clearly exceeding industry benchmarks. So, while consumers continue to spend cautiously, we feel confident as we enter the holiday season. And we\u2019re focused on continuing to deliver on both our strategic priorities and our financial goals.","As we mentioned in our last conference call, our third quarter plans were based on the knowledge that we are facing stronger prior year comparisons than we had experienced earlier in the year. Now, with the quarter behind us, I am pleased to report that not only did we meet our forecast we saw continued progress on our strategy. Specifically two-year growth trends in comp sales, traffic and signature category performances each accelerated in the third quarter, following strong performance in the second quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.86 was 8.6% higher than last year and above the midpoint of our guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter.","Third quarter comparable sales were up 1.9%, also near the high-end of our guidance, and driven primarily by growth in traffic. We are really pleased that our guests are responding to the investments we\u2019re making in our assortment, presentation, and shopping experience. And we\u2019re focused on building on this year\u2019s traffic increases in both, stores and our digital platforms in the quarters and years ahead.","Our third quarter gross margin rate was down slightly to last year, reflecting the benefits of a favorable merchandising mix and the comparison over last year\u2019s intense promotional markdowns. These benefits were offset by reimbursement pressure in pharmacy combined with the impact on investments in quality and innovation on our owned and exclusive brands.","Third quarter SG&A expenses were solid and in line with our expectation, as Cathy will cover in a few minutes. We reported a very healthy after-tax return on invested capital of 13% this quarter, nearly 2 percentage points higher than a year ago as progress on our strategic priorities has driven improved profitability on a relatively stable base of invested capital.","Given the stable performance, we continue to have capacity to invest in our business, while returning a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders. This quarter, we will return well over $1 billion through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to well over $3 billion so far this year.","Consistent with our guidance, our third quarter comp sales increase was somewhat smaller than the second quarter. From a category perspective, the entire change of pace in sales was attributable to apparel and electronics. In apparel, third quarter comp sales grew just under 3% compared with nearly 5% in the second quarter. This slowdown was correlated with warm weather in September followed by a reacceleration when somewhat cooler temperatures arrived in October.","In the electronics category, we saw a double-digit decline in the third quarter comp sales. This performance reflects the comparison over last year\u2019s most intense electronic promotions, which occurred in August and the continued softness in tablets, consistent with industry trends. One standout in electronics was wearable devices, part of the signature Wellness category, where we saw nearly 100% growth in comparable sales. Another standout was our Toy category, part of the signature Kids business, which matched its second quarter growth with another 12% comp sales increase this quarter. Beyond strength in licensed products, growth in toys was broad-based across multiple sub categories including small dolls, LEGO, action toys and board games.","We were also pleased with third quarter results from seasonal programs, beginning with solid performance in back-to-school and back-to-college all the way through Halloween when we saw very strong increases in costumes and d\u00e9cor and solid growth in candy. And to show you why are we so excited about the upcoming Star Wars release, we had the number one market share in Star Wars when we launched it in our store back in September.","Looking through the lens of our category roles, third quarter comp sales growth was led by signature categories which grew more than two and a half times as fast as our overall sales. And as I mentioned, given the tougher prior year comparisons, our two-year stack comps in signature categories were stronger in the third quarter than either of the first two quarters of this year.","Beyond toys and wearable electronics, our third quarter standouts within signature included baby and kids\u2019 apparel, women\u2019s ready to wear and wellness items and food.","In food overall, for the first time this year, third quarter comp sales growth outpaced comp sales overall as our work to reinvigorate this category is beginning to shape our performance. In key categories like yogurt where we added premium and better-for-you brands, we saw high single digit comp sales increase in the third quarter. We saw similar comp increases in craft beer and wine, reflecting our work to enhance the assortment and bring locally relevant brands to our guests.","Looking forward, we will continue to enhance our food assortment with a focus on wellness, local relevance and seasonally appropriate items. And following the holiday season, we will begin testing changes to food shopping environment in a set of 25 remodels scheduled for the LA market along with a set of SuperTarget remodels scheduled for next year.","Digital sales increased 20% in the third quarter, contributing about 40 basis points to our comp sales increase. While significantly outpacing the industry, this performance was well below our expectation of 30% growth which we outlined in the last call.","As we look at the drivers of this performance, it\u2019s clear the third quarter softness in electronics was particularly impactful online. And like our stores, digital sales growth in apparel was slower during much of the quarter, correlating with the relatively warm weather across much of the country. We know that our digital investments drive engagement and sales in all of our channels. And we are pleased that our third quarter sales were near the high end of our expectations. However, we believe we have an opportunity to accelerate digital transactions by enhancing the experience on Target.com.","Beyond our efforts to streamline the guest experience on our site, our team is rolling out multiple initiatives that we expect to drive digital traffic and sales over time. And once again, this holiday season, we expect to be offering free shipping on all digital orders. We are very pleased with the guest response to this offer a year ago and we expect it to be a key differentiator for Target again this holiday season.","Regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled, in a store or in a guest front porch, we know the vast majority of our sales in all of our channels are digitally enabled. For example, our guests access our brands through a digital device, both in advanced hub and during their trip to one of our stores. As a result, we don\u2019t think that digital is simply a selling channel, but a critical enabler of the shopping experience in all of our channels. This has significant strategic implications, both in terms of organizational structured and the way we reward our team.","Since I arrived last year, we have been evolving our approach to focus first on our core guests and build a total Target assortment that best serves the needs and expectations of our guest. Only after we have determined the appropriate assortment, do we plan on how to offer it to each of our selling channels. Consider efforts in signature categories. For more than a year now, we\u2019ve been investing in these categories with the expectation that they will grow most rapidly and we\u2019ve seen this play out in all of our channels. In fact, even while our digital footprint remains relatively small, we\u2019re approaching $1 billion of annual sales in our home category, making us one of the leading digital retailers in the states.","As we look ahead to the holidays, we are excited about our merchandising and marketing plans, and we believe we\u2019ll further differentiate Target during a critical retail season. In hardlines, Toys has already turned in a terrific performance so far this year. And we expect this strength to continue throughout the fourth quarter, when we simply generate half of our annual toy sales. This year more than 15% of our toy assortment is exclusive to Target, including the exclusive BB-8 Droid from the upcoming Star Wars movie which we expect to be a top seller. We\u2019re also bringing back our Kids\u2019 Wish List back, this year with enhanced features to make it easy and fun for family and friends to shop for the perfect gift for every kid in their life. Our gift catalog featuring more than 700 items was distributed to 40 million guests this year through direct mail, newspaper and distribution in our stores.","On Cartwheel, we\u2019re seeing great results from our daily toy deal, which is featuring a different toy at 50% off every day through December 24th. And finally, we\u2019re bringing everything together on our kids gifting hub on Target.com, which is designed to make shopping easy for parents and gift givers while create a destination as fun and inspirational for kids.","In electronics, we\u2019re excited to be one of the few retailers offering the Apple Watch in stores this season. And we expect this item to be a top gift item in wearable categories. Also in wearables, we partnered with UNICEF to offer their kids our band, which encourages kids to get more active, and based on the point they accumulate, improve the lives of kids around the world. We also expect drones [ph] to be a big hit this season. So, we\u2019re featuring nearly 20 in-store, and about four times as many online.","We\u2019re planning for a big season in video games, a key gifting category where hardware prices continue to moderate and software libraries continue to grow. And in entertainment, where we\u2019re very excited to be featuring a Target exclusive version of Adele\u2019s new 25 release that features three bonus tacks available, only at Target.","As we enter the holiday season, about 1,400 of our stores are featuring mannequins in apparel, which is around double the number we had a year ago. Also this year we\u2019ve enhanced the shopping experience by updating presentations in home and electronics, in more than 200 additional stores for each group. So, we feel great about the ability of our stores to showcase our assortment. And this year when our guests shop at Target for the holidays, they\u2019ll find assortment focused on three key things, entertaining; decorating; and gifting.","To support each of these themes, we\u2019ve invested in quality and differentiation, featuring real marble, hand carved wood, copper accent and genuine leather. In fact, more than 20% of our holiday gifting items are handcrafted this year.","In food, we\u2019re highlighting exclusive brands and flavors, including Republic of Wine, our new exclusive brand which features unique discoveries from around the world. We\u2019re rolling out classic holiday and flavors in Archer Farms and we\u2019re offering exclusive indulgent seasonal flavors from great natural brand partners with M&M\u2019s Hershey\u2019s, Dove and Ghirardelli. And finally, anticipation\u2019s building for Black Friday, which is just over a week away. Once again, this year, we\u2019re opening our stores at 6:00 pm on Thanksgiving and our team is already preparing to deliver a combination of great deals and a shopping experience that makes Target different from everyone else. But we\u2019re committed to offering compelling savings, value beyond the traditional Black Friday event. Beginning this Sunday, we\u2019ll launch 10 days of deals on electronics, kitchenware, toys and more which will run through Tuesday, December 1st. This Sunday\u2019s Weekly Ad, we\u2019ll also revel special deals from our Black Friday presale, which takes place on Wednesday, November 2015.","For our guests who prefer to shop digitally, all of our Black Friday deals will be offered on Target.com. And finally, guests who spend $75 or more on Friday, November 27th, will receive a voucher for 20% off on future purchases, redeemable from December 4th through the 13th.","Last March, in our meeting with the financial community, we outlined our plan to grow profitably by focusing on a set of key enterprise priorities. And, while we have much more work to do, we remain committed to that plan, and our pleased with our progress so far.","Through the first three quarters of 2015, we have successfully grown traffic, sales and profits, a bit faster than we originally expected by focusing on our core guests and providing them with differentiated assortment and the experience they expect and deserve. But we\u2019re not slowing down, because we see enormous opportunity still ahead of us. We are going to continue to focus on elevating the assortment, quality and the presentation in our signature categories. Across every category, we will differentiate Target assortment by providing exclusive items from both our national branded partners and one of a kind items from our outstanding product, design and development team. And while we\u2019re encouraged with the recent acceleration in food sales, we are still in a very early stages of our work to provide a unique assortment of fresh, local and healthy items to our guests.","And finally, while I\u2019m pleased we\u2019ve already made early progress in our efforts to improve our in-stock performance, I believe we\u2019ve got a multiyear opportunity to improve our reliability, both in-stores and in digital channels by modernizing way we work and refocusing on retail fundamentals.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Mulligan, who will discuss this team\u2019s early efforts to improve operations as well as John\u2019s priorities going forward. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Brain. Good morning, everyone.","Today, I\u2019m going to provide an update on our initial efforts to reinforce our retail fundamentals, particularly our in-stock position, and I\u2019ll cover our priorities and progress in our work to modernize the supply chain in support of our strategic initiatives.","The good news is that while we have lots of work still ahead of us, we have seen meaningful improvement in key in-stock measures based on changes we\u2019ve made in the last few months. While we stride to be in-stock on every item, in every store throughout every day, we know that need-based commodity categories are the most critical. If our guests don\u2019t believe that they can rely on Target to have their shopping list items available every time they shop, they will begin to skip some trips to Target, even though they enjoy shopping our more discretionary categories. As a result, when in-stock metrics on our core commodity categories began deteriorating this year, we created an out of stock action team to conduct deep dives by category to identify both, short-term and long-term solutions.","When the team identifies solutions within a category, we can quickly test them to confirm they improve our performance and then determine if those solutions can be applied more broadly. This team focused first on our household, personal, baby category and more recently, they\u2019ve done work on our center store grocery category. In a short amount of time, they\u2019ve identified opportunities related to the way we generate vendor orders, optimize tradeoffs between order quantities and frequency and our reliance on system generated solutions versus manual processes. In high-volume stores, the team has implemented adjustments to planograms to enhance holding capacity on fast turning SKUs, reducing the need for frequent store replenishment. And in our distribution centers, the team has identified opportunities to reduce lead-time variability, tighten delivery windows, and in some cases increase safety stock on key items. I should note that this increase in safety stock is one of the drivers of the 4% inventory growth we reported at the end of the quarter.","In a very short-time, the results of our efforts have been encouraging. In household, personal, baby, we\u2019ve been able to reduce overall out of stock measures by approximately 50% in about eight weeks. In centers for grocery, in less than a month, the team was able to reduce out of stock measures by about 25%. And importantly, we\u2019ve been able to reduce out of stock even further on the items most important to our guests.","Given these encouraging initial results, the team is moving quickly to scale these solutions to a broader set of categories throughout the store, and conducting additional deep dives in categories like health and beauty.","Looking ahead, the team has a number of key priorities, including work to optimize case packs, which will better accommodate variability in store sales volume across our network. In addition, they are implementing technology and process improvement to improve count integrity throughout our stores and distribution network. Included in these efforts will be a test of RFID technology in a few of our apparel categories to gauge the effectiveness of the technology relative to the cost of implementation. This work has been supported by the rollout of an agile technology development in partnership with Mike McNamara, our new Chief Information Officer and our newly hired Senior Vice President of Operational Excellence, Anu Gupta. We are very excited to have Anu on the team. She has more than 20 years of relevant experience in driving operational excellence by leveraging best practices in a variety of operating models including procurement and lean six sigma process redesign across the range of industries including retail. We are confident Anu will accelerate the efforts of the outstanding team we already have in place.","Beyond our work to improve reliability, our store teams are working diligently to support Target\u2019s efforts to become more flexible in the way we fulfill guest demand. As a result of last year\u2019s rollout of ship-from-store capability, stores have already shipped more than 10 million items directly to guests so far this year. And the percent of digital orders delivered in a three-day window has more than doubled compared with a year ago. To showcase this improvement in our capabilities, last quarter we rolled out new functionality, we call available-to-promise, which offers guests a more precise shipping window. With available-to-promise, we expect nearly two-thirds of our digital orders will offer our guests a delivery window of three business days or fewer compared with our typical window of four to seven business days, prior to the rollout. We recently expanded our ship-from-store capability to more than 300 additional stores, bringing the total to more than a quarter of the chain. This will enable about 40% of digital transactions to be shipped from our stores in the fourth quarter. In addition, two new direct-to-guest fulfillment centers became operational in the third quarter, in advance of the holiday season. With the expanded capacity these changes provide, we expect to continue making progress on shipping speed next year.","As Brian mentioned, most of our store sales are digitally enabled, so we continue to integrate digital experiences into the stores. Guest increasingly use Cartwheel, a digital savings app with more than 20 million authenticated users to plan their store chips in advance and then use the app to search for additional deals while shopping in store. In addition, because 10% to 15% of our digital orders are picked up in stores, we\u2019re exploring ways to streamline the pickup process by expanding holding capacity at the service counter and implementing process improvements to reduce wait times. For next year\u2019s LA25 remodels, we will feature all of latest merchandising enhancements. We will test changes to the frontend that will make order pickup even more convenient, including dedicated investors to help store guests better understand Target\u2019s digital capabilities.","Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I want to thank our store and distribution center teams for their great performance so far this year and for their current efforts to ensure we provide an outstanding guest experience this holiday season. It\u2019s an enormous challenge for both our stores and distribution teams to accommodate the surge in volumes we see at Black Friday. But our store teams don\u2019t focus only on moving merchandise. They focus first on our guests and do an amazing amount of preparation to ensure guests have a pleasant and safe experience. It\u2019s one of the many things that makes Target unique and one of the reasons why guests love our stores and our brand.","With that, I will turn it over Cathy who will share her insights on our third quarter financial performance, and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks, John. And hello, everyone.","As Brian mentioned earlier, we\u2019re pleased that this quarter\u2019s performance was near the high-end of our guidance for both sales and adjusted EPS. As is often the case, when you get into the detailed P&L, there were some ins and outs within the quarter that generally offset each other, which I\u2019ll cover in a few minutes.","This quarter adjusted EPS was $0.86, above the midpoint of our guidance range and 8.6% above last year. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.76, $0.10 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.05 of asset-impairments, $0.03 of data breach expense, and $0.02 related to the corporate restructuring we announced last spring. Third quarter GAAP EPS was $0.87 compared with the $0.55 a year ago, as this year we recognized $0.11 of tax benefits related to our investment losses in Canada, while last year we incurred $0.27 of after-tax losses related to Canadian operations.","Let\u2019s turn to third quarter segment results. Among the drivers of our 1.9% comparable sales growth, we are pleased that traffic grew a very healthy 1.4% in the third quarter. This growth is even more encouraging when we look at performance on a two-year basis, as we faced a tougher comparison in the third quarter than either of the first two quarters of the year. October marked our 12th straight month of traffic growth. And we are laser focused on his metric as a key indicator of the health of our business over time.","Breaking out our sales growth between stores and our digital platforms, the stores accounted for a little over three quarters of our comparable sales growth while digital contributed about 40 basis points to our third quarter comp. Consistent with results from earlier in the year, our digital growth continues to be driven by a meaningful improvement in conversion. And although we have seen an acceleration in the last two months, we haven\u2019t seen a growth in digital traffic we expected to see this year. We believe our biggest opportunity to drive traffic continues to be our work to streamline and enhance the digital experience.","Third quarter REDcard penetration was 22.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago. And we remain on track to meet our guidance for an increase of 100 basis points or more for the full-year. As you\u2019ll recall, we tested REDcard rewards in the Kansas City market for a year, before we launched the program nationwide. With the benefit of that head start, penetration in Kansas City continues to run well ahead of the rest of the country, giving us confidence that we have continued room to grow this rewards program in the years ahead.","In addition, we are optimistic that the industry\u2019s move to EMV or Chip-and-PIN technology will help restore confidence in the U.S. payment system and increase the willingness of consumers to add new cards to their wallets. Regarding our move to EMV, we are pleased to be one of only a few large retailers in the United States that are accepting chip cards for both credit and debit transactions in advance of this holiday season. We\u2019ve already reissued chip cards to about half of our Target branded debit and credit card holders. And we expect to complete the rollout early next year, following a pause for the holiday season.","Our third quarter segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were both about 20 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our guidance as strong SG&A performance offset the impact of a lower than expected gross margin rate.","On the gross margin line, third quarter performance was about 10 basis points below last year, short of our expectations. While we continue to benefit from the comparison to last year\u2019s promotions, the benefit is waning as the intensity of those promotions began to taper in the third quarter of last year. In addition consistent with results from earlier in the year, we are seeing continued margin pressure from quality investments in our owned and exclusive brands. Finally, this quarter, we saw a reimbursement pressure in our pharmacy business which we expect to continue until we complete the sale of this business to CVS.","I want to pause for a moment and comment on the CVS transaction. We continue to work closely with the CVS team to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction. And while we don\u2019t have an update on the potential timing for the transaction to close, we are pleased with our progress to-date.","Turning back to the third quarter P&L, on the SG&A expense line, we saw unexpectedly strong performance in the third quarter, about 30 basis points lower than last year. As part of our efforts to control cost, this quarter\u2019s expense rate benefitted from the discontinuation of an outdated little used retiree medical plan but we also saw discipline across the organization which drove outstanding underlying performance. Even on the marketing line, where some expenses were retimed into the third quarter from the second quarter last year, we recognized savings in other programs that led to overall favorability compared with last year.","As John mentioned and consistent with last quarter, our inventory position at the end of the third quarter was about 4% above last year. This reflects a significant improvement from the higher year-over-year increases we were seeing earlier this year. And while inventory growth is slightly higher than our pace of sales, it reflects changes in receipt timing compared with last year, combined with the intentional investments we are making in commodity categories to improve our in-stock position. As a result, we feel very good about our inventory position going into the holiday season in relation to both our sales planned and our work to improve in-stock reliability.","Turning back to consolidated metrics, third quarter interest expense was a $151 million, $5 million higher than last year. Our third quarter effective tax rate on continuing operations was 34.3%, up from 30.6% last year when we recognized a $30 million benefit from the resolution of tax matters.","We paid third quarter dividends of $352 million, up about 7% from last year. And given our cash position and continued strong business results, we have the opportunity to invest another $924 million in share repurchase this quarter.","Given our long ranged plan to generate profitable growth, we believe the continued opportunity to retire shares will prove to be a productive use of cash. To illustrate that point, under our current $10 billion share repurchase program, we have retired more than 77 million shares, representing more than 12% of our current shares outstanding at an average price of less than $69.","As Brian mentioned our after tax return on invested capital or ROIC was a very healthy 13% for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter. This is nearly 2 percentage points higher than last year when our business results were under pressure following the data breach. Given our plan to generate profitable growth on a relatively stable base of invested capital, we expect to continue to grow this metric over time with a goal to reach the mid teens or higher in the next five years. ","Now, let\u2019s turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter and what that guidance implies for our expected full year performance. As we look ahead to the holiday season, we are mindful that the consumer remains cautious, and there are indications that heavy inventory levels at some competitors. However, we remain focused on the things we can control and what has been working all year. These include our ability to deliver on our expect more, pay less brand promise by offering great products at a compelling value, iconic marketing that guests love, and an outstanding store experience that differentiates Target from everyone else.","With that context, we expect to deliver a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 1% to 2%, consistent with our third quarter guidance. Underlying that guidance, we expect digital growth of about 20%, consistent with our third quarter performance.","Before I move down -- further down the Q4 P&L, I want to pause and discuss a challenge we hear a lot, which is based on the acceleration in two-year stacked performance we are planning for the fourth quarter.","John answered this question last call but I think it\u2019s worth addressing in more detail today. Last year, our fourth quarter comparable sales growth was 3.8% but that was on top of a 2.5% sales decline in the fourth quarter 2013, when we announced the data breach on the weekend before Christmas. So while the analysis of multiyear sales performance isn\u2019t always useful, I think in this case, it\u2019s important to think about a three-year stack of our comp sales. Specifically, if we hit the midpoint of our fourth quarter sales guidance, the simple three-year stack would be a 2.8% comp, slightly less than the 3%, three-year stack we\u2019ve delivered year-to-date. So, while there are always risks to every sales forecast, we don\u2019t believe the two-year stack provides useful insight in this case.","Moving back to the P&L, we expect our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate to be flat to down slightly from last year\u2019s 9.8% rate. Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, we expect moderate gross margin rate decline to be offset by a similar improvement in our SG&A expense rate, this quarter. We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be consistent with our third quarter and our tax rate is expected to be approximately 34%, as we annualize over last year\u2019s favorable resolution of tax matters. With our current cash position and expected business results, we\u2019ve planned to continue repurchasing our shares this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to manage the magnitude and pace of repurchase activity with the goal of maintaining our current investment grade ratings. Altogether, this performance would lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.48 to $1.58 compared with a $1.49 in fourth quarter 2014.","Let\u2019s look at what this guidance implies for our expectations for full year 2015 financial performance, which I\u2019ll compare to the guidance we provided at our financial community meeting last March. At that meeting, we laid out an expectation for 2015 comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Given our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we expect our full year comps to remain firmly in that range. I would note that the channel mix of our sales has been different than expectations. Specifically with year-to-date digitals sales growth of 29% and our expected 20% growth in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s clear that in 2015, we don\u2019t expect to attain the longer term 40% goal we laid out in March. However, we\u2019ve delivered on our overall comparable sales goal every quarter this year and we still expect to deliver industry leading digital sales growth, both important benchmarks for us.","In March, we laid out an expectation to grow our segment EBITDA margin rate by 20 to 30 basis points for the year, and we\u2019re on track to outperform that expectation with growth closer to 40 to 50 basis points in 2015. Regarding capital deployment, we are on track to meet our guidance for 5% to 10% dividend growth this year, and we\u2019ve already met our goal for $2 billion or more in share repurchases through the first three quarters of the year. And finally, we told you in March that we expected to generate $4.45 to $4.65 in adjusted EPS for the year. And despite a challenging backdrop with our updated guidance today, we\u2019re positioned to deliver performance at the high end or above that range for the year.","Beyond my love for the brand, I was attracted to Target because of our singular focus on delighting our guests and our tremendous desire to win. It\u2019s evidenced across our stores, online team, distribution centers and headquarters. I recently visited one of our stores and had the opportunity to meet Bev who has been with the Company for an amazing 44 years. In her current role, Bev is involved and they ship-from-store process and she says their whole team loves this new capability because it allows our stores to drive sales by serving guests in new ways.","Now that I\u2019ve been emerged in our business for the past three months, I\u2019m mindful of the opportunity ahead of us and the work we still need to do to accomplish. But I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve seen already. Traffic has increased for a full year; signature categories are leading our sales every quarter and with a renewed focus on retail fundamentals and the dedication of team members like Bev, we are delivering on our vision to provide shopping on demand while maintaining our focus on everyday in-stock reliability across our store network. The ultimate measure of this year\u2019s accomplishment can be seen in our earnings. We\u2019ve delivered a 16.9% increase in our adjusted earnings per share so far this year. And with our fourth quarter guidance, we\u2019re well-positioned to deliver double-digit growth for the year. We\u2019re excited about this initial progress and we remain laser focused on building on this momentum over time.","With that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now Brain, John, and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer","First, Brain, I\u2019m hoping that we can get a little bit of a pulse of the consumer from you. Clearly there\u2019s been some weather impact in September and October but we\u2019re hearing negative comments about November from another -- a number of retailers. So, it feels like there\u2019s something else happening either from a macro or maybe a competitive standpoint. I\u2019d love to get your sense for what you\u2019re hearing from your customers or guests?","Brain Cornell","Matt, I\u2019d tell you, we\u2019re feeling really good about the trends we\u2019re seeing, the reaction we\u2019re getting from the guests. Certainly the growth in traffic for us is really encouraging. So, we\u2019re seeing more Target guests come back to our stores and visit our sites. And they are continuing to respond very positively to the work we\u2019ve done in signature categories. So, sitting here today, we are very confident about our position. We think we are connecting with the consumer and our guest. And I feel fantastic about the plans we have in place for the fourth quarter. So, while obviously still cautious, as we sit here early in November, we feel very good about the way the consumer and the guest is responding to our brand. And I feel as if we are really well-positioned for the fourth quarter.","Matt Nemer","That\u2019s great to hear. And then just shifting gears to gross margins. I\u2019m wondering if you can call out the impact of the reimbursement pressure in healthcare and any sense for the total impact or a run rate impact following the closure of your deal with CVS, how that could help you next year? And then secondly on gross margin, you did call out in the press release private brand investments. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could dimensionalize the potential size of that over the next few years? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Let me talk about the owned brand investments we\u2019re making and then let Cathy talk through the RX implications. But, as we have consistently talked about throughout the last year and year and a half now, we think one of the things that differentiates Target is the value; the quality of the innovation we bring to our own brands. So, we\u2019re clearly looking to make sure we bring more value to our owned brands. I talked about the number of handcrafted items we are going to have for the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re being very surgical with those investments. But we\u2019re seeing a great reaction from the guest as we elevate the value we offer in our owned brands. So, we\u2019ll be very surgical, very selective but we\u2019re certainly seeing a great return through the investments we\u2019re making.","Cathy Smith","With regards to the pharmacy reimbursement pressure, as we said when we announced the transaction with CVS that we lack scale and we knew that we are going to continue to see pressure here over time. So, what we\u2019re seeing in this quarter is in the range of 15 to 20 basis points of pressure in the quarter and which is why we are excited to be partnering with CVS because they will be able to help with that scale.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Schick from Stifel. ","David Schick","Wonder if you could give us any extra color or update on the localization work in Chicago?","Brian Cornell","Right now, we are still very focused on testing localization in Chicago; we\u2019re very pleased with the results. And certainly, a lot of the localization\u2019s taking place in our food and beverage offerings; we\u2019re seeing the guests respond to that. And we are going to take the learning from Chicago and apply it to the 25 stores we\u2019re remodeling in Los Angeles. So, we will continue to expand the learning, take it from Chicago to LA. But I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. And we\u2019re partnering with John and the store and supply chain teams to make sure over time we can scale the learning from Chicago and Los Angeles to multiple markets around the country.","David Schick","So last time you had updated us, I think you said 100 to 200 basis-point comp lift. Does the very pleased sort of mean it\u2019s we\u2019re continuing to see that? ","Brian Cornell","We are consistently seeing those kinds of returns.","David Schick","Got it. And then quick on the dotcom side of the business. There was some deceleration and still good growth in that line. Can you talk about any other metrics that help us understand the shift; is it time spent on the site, capabilities, what is driving the difference in the growth rate? And it sounds like a growth rate you are comfortable with for next quarter.","Brian Cornell","I think the most important measure to look at is what\u2019s happening with online growth overall. And just in last 24 hours, we saw the October e-commerce growth rates in the U.S. and it was up about 8.6%. The outlook that NRF has for e-commerce growth in the fourth quarter is somewhere between 6% and 8%. So, while our 20% growth rate is not in line with our expectations, it\u2019s still dramatically outperforming the industry. And I think the most important measure we are looking at is the fact that over 80% of our guests start their shopping journey online, either at home on their desktop or via the mobile device. And that digitally influenced guest is coming into our stores more often.","So, as we\u2019ve talked about our strategy, our strategy is to make sure we allow our guests to shop anywhere anytime they want with Target. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is they\u2019re voting with their feet to spend more time in our stores. They are downloading our Cartwheel app; I think 20 million downloads so far to-date. So, I think we\u2019re seeing an overall slowdown in digital growth across retail, and we\u2019re really pleased that we continue to outpace the industry, dramatically outpace the industry but our digital efforts are driving more traffic into our stores and helping us grow our overall comp. So, while there has been a slowdown broadly across the sector, we continue to outpace the industry and that\u2019s our fundamental goal.","Operator","Your next question is from Kate McShane from Citi Research.","Kate McShane","It\u2019s encouraging to hear that a lot of the investments especially in the signature categories are panning out well for you. In your merchandising strategies specifically, where do you think you still have the most work to do, and what can we expect year-over-year when we see those categories for holiday?","Brian Cornell","I think we\u2019re making some very good strides starting in apparel. And while 3% in Q3 was slightly less than the growth rate we saw in the second quarter, compared to many of our peers, we recognized that we\u2019re continuing to build traffic and growth in an important apparel category. So, the work we\u2019ve done with mannequins, with changing the in-store experience clearly paying off. One of the changes that we\u2019ve announced recently is the addition of 1,400 visual merchandisers to make sure we combine the changes that we\u2019re ranking with mannequins and fixtures and layouts with experts in-store that can maintain that great in store merchandising experience. So that\u2019s a new venture for us; we\u2019re standing it up for the holidays; we expect that to continue to strengthen the in-store experience.","And we know with our signature categories, we\u2019re still at the very, very early stages of standing up our wellness position. But we feel like we\u2019re in an excellent position with baby and kids, feel very good about our performance in the third quarter with kids apparel, certainly toys has been a highlight throughout the year, and we feel as if we\u2019re well-positioned coming off of second and third quarter comps in toys that were up 12%. The reaction we\u2019ve seen from the guests to our Star Wars assortment where we captured an industry-leading position and expect to be a destination during the holidays. So, while we still have much more work to do, we feel very good about the progress we\u2019re making in signature categories. And I think the addition of visual merchandisers, in-store, will help us maintain our merchandising appeal throughout the holidays.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","So, I wanted to get back into the food discussion, if we could, and I think you\u2019re testing stuff in Chicago; you\u2019re going to roll that into LA. Brian, maybe a lot of people don\u2019t know this, maybe they do, but you had a good experience back when you were at Safeway and then onto Sam\u2019s, I think you\u2019ve talked about 200 basis points you were initially seeing. But what can we expect out of the Company? I think Safeway saw more than that as they kind of brought in some kind of refurbishments. And when can we expect to see more from Target, as far as refreshing the d\u00e9cor and maybe doing a fuller rollout; and is 200 basis points a good expectation? It seems to me it could actually be higher than that as you refine your lift, but wanted to get some more details there.","Brian Cornell","Scott, I am glad you asked the question. I do think one of our highlights in Q3 was the improved performance in food. I was actually seeing food comp acceleration throughout the year. And while we haven\u2019t made major changes with fixtures and in-store d\u00e9cor, we\u2019ve been very focused on assortment changes and bringing more natural, organic local items into many of our categories, and we\u2019re seeing the guest react very favorably. So, to me, it\u2019s getting the basics right. And before we start making fixture changes and d\u00e9cor changes, it has to start with the right assortment, and making sure we have the items, the brands our guest is looking for when they shop food at Target.","So, the acceleration you\u2019re seeing right now is driven by section-by-section getting the assortment right, bringing more appealing items to our guests, adding more natural organic gluten-free items that are on trend to those categories. We made some significant changes in yogurt in the third quarter and saw very, very positive responses, high single-digit growth rates in those categories. So, while we\u2019re not shouting about it, we\u2019re making steady progress in food. We\u2019ll learn a lot more in 25 stores in Los Angeles where you will see some changes in fixtures and d\u00e9cor. And as we learn, we will continue to grow. So, I think we do have significant upside. But, Scott, this is about making sure, we get it right. And we\u2019re going to take a slow steady approach, solid consistent results every quarter, and continue to deliver what the guest is looking for from an assortment and experience standpoint, when they shop food at Target.","Scott Mushkin","So, I mean obviously key, I think Cathy said you\u2019re measuring one of the big things you look at as frequency, and this is obviously a core to that, so we look forward to seeing more. But, my follow-up question is on the investment side. We get it a lot whether it\u2019d be e-commerce, whether we\u2019d be in the food, in the logistics. Can you talk us through why there won\u2019t be a massive ramp up in investment, as we go out the next couple years and that you have enough money in the CapEx and then kind of SG&A to kind of handle what the Company needs to do?","Brian Cornell","Scott, we\u2019ve looked at this very carefully. And I know we\u2019ve talked about it at a number of times. We feel very confident that the CapEx budgets we\u2019ve had in place will be very adequate over time to make the changes we need to make from a technology standpoint, a supply chain standpoint, continue to refresh our stores, and maintain our focus on maintenance investments. So, sitting here, Cathy and I spent a lot of time recently. Obviously John has been a great steward of our CapEx spending. And we feel very comfortable that our current spending levels will allow us to modernize the organization, enhance technology, improve supply chain, and make sure we are on the way we are continuing to enhance the in-store experience and match that up with a great online experience for our guest.","Cathy Smith","I would offer just real quickly to add to that, because we have kind of pressure tested this one ourselves a lot. We have not -- Target has not underinvested over the years. And I think that bodes will with the state of where you find our stores as well as our technology and supply chain investments we need. So, I feel very good about where we are. And with that level of investment, we have been pretty consistent.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","I would like to ask a two-part question, the first relates to the cost cutting initiatives that you discussed at your analyst meeting earlier in the year. You spoke about the $1.5 billion in SG&A and $0.5 billion on cost of goods over two years. If you could talk about the run rate that you are at now against those goals. And I guess another twist on Scott\u2019s question, the degree to which you\u2019ve had investments inside that would offset some of those; I think that was also part of the plan that you set forth?","John Mulligan","So, I will jump in and take that. I think from a tracking perspective what we said, right to your point, $1.5 billion of SG&A, $0.5 billion of margin, and we would deliver in 2015 about $0.5 billion of that. We are running a little bit ahead of that pace and both in the cost of goods and in the SG&A space, both are running perhaps a little bit ahead of what we envisioned going into the year. So we feel really good about that.","I think stepping back and kind of tying this back to Scott\u2019s question, the other thing we said at the time was we are taking $2 billion out of the P&L but we didn\u2019t expect EBITDA margin expansion. And our view was that we would need this to fuel the investments, exactly some of the expense investments that perhaps Scott was referring to, and this would provide the capacity to do that. And that is in fact what we are seeing. We are seeing greatest discipline across the corporation but where we needed to invest we have had the capacity to do that.","Matthew Fassler","If I could ask a quick follow-up. Can you talk about $0.5 billion this year; is that delivered? I know it\u2019s not been delivered to the bottom-line because there are some offsets, but is that annualized run rate achieved, or is that actual cost cuts that would have come out on a gross basis against your cost base offset by some of the investments?","John Mulligan","We will take out $600 million this year.","Cathy Smith","Yes.","John Mulligan","And then the part of next year will be annualization of that and part of it will be incremental.","Matthew Fassler","And then a very quick follow-up, on wages. Obviously Walmart made an incremental announcement since your last call. Any sense as to whether this issue is kind of bring up organically in the field as you think about hiring and you think about intrinsic wage pressure in the marketplace and how you are thinking about that relative to your plan?","Brian Cornell","Yes, we don\u2019t see any material change in the marketplace. Again, we have talked a lot in the past about making sure we are investing to have the best retail team. And we look at this very surgically year-after-year, market-by-market, and we think we are in a great position. And we think we are hiring terrific talent. And we are excited that we have got a great team in place as we get ready for the holidays.","Operator","Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","I guess my two questions are a bit of a follow-up, one on the last one. If you look at the fourth quarter guidance, if I am getting this right, SG&A dollars are kind of flattish. And, is that basically that cost out with the reinvestment going in? And then the nature of that question is really I think John you mentioned, 40% of digital you thought would be shipped from store in the fourth quarter. What has it been running and what does that due to the labor model?","Cathy Smith","I will take the first part of it. To answer your question, yes, we expected to be essentially flat, and it will be pretty much offset; we will have pluses and minuses. So, the savings we are getting, we will continue to reinvest, as we have planned. John will answer the 40% digital shipment.","John Mulligan","Sure Greg, 40% this quarter and it will peak a little bit higher than that actually, typically running more in the 20% to 25%. But as we peak, this is a great way for us to utilize our store assets.","The labor model, what happens here is, actually it\u2019s quite efficient because we have dedicated teams in those stores who do the picking, do the packing, and we are just able to use them, utilize them more efficiently. So, while there is more store labor that we are using, the offset clearly comes in our shipping expense because we are much closer to the guest we are shipping to, and then on the same P&L line but it\u2019s an outstanding trade for us.","Brian Cornell","Greg, I think it\u2019s important as you tie out the math on the ship from store. Last year at this time, we had just over about 120 stores where we were shipping from store. As we sit here today, we are up to 462. So, we have expanded the base. We are going to leverage and swept the assets I think much more effectively. But importantly that enhanced base allows us to deliver to our guests in a much shorter timeframe. So, we would expect that to grow during the holidays. We have certainly ramped up for it. And we think that\u2019s going to provide a much better shopping experience and allow us to deliver products to our guests in a much shorter period of time.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s helpful. And if I could follow up, I think earlier you talked about private label penetration little bit. Could you talk about how the stronger dollar or falling raw material costs or lower fuel costs could be impacting gross margin today differently than you would have thought few quarters ago?","Cathy Smith","I\u2019ll answer it briefly and then anyone can chime in. We\u2019re really not seeing an impact on it in our product cost or in obviously in our margins. So, it\u2019s really been kind of non-event for us.","Brian Cornell","And remember, Greg, with many of those items, those are long-lead time items.","Cathy Smith","Yes.","Brian Cornell","So, we\u2019ll certainly be watching that over time. But, as we seat here today, many of those orders and deals were placed many, many months ago. So, we\u2019ll continue to monitor that over time but we certainly like our position with our own brands as we enter the holidays. And that\u2019s an important way that we differentiate.","Well, operator, it looks like we have got time for one more call.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from Bob Drbul from Nomura. ","Bob Drbul","Just two quick questions, the first one is on the apparel performance. You talked a little bit about margin pressure I think in private label and exclusive -- was that new to the third quarter; and how do you see that playing out in the fourth quarter? And then the second question I have is on the e-commerce business. Just give us an update on like the subscription offerings and how that\u2019s going from a fulfillment perspective as well.","Brian Cornell","Bob, first on ANA side, again we think the guest is responding really well to some of the changes we\u2019ve made with our own brand assortment. And the investments that we talked about today, we\u2019ve been consistently talking about for over a year now, making sure that we\u2019re reinvesting in quality, in innovation, in style, making sure that we deliver that expect more pay less brand promise. So, the guest is reacting really, really well to that. And we\u2019re going to continue to make sure that we deliver great value in our own brands. So, it shouldn\u2019t be a new phenomena; it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been very clear and transparent about. And we think it\u2019s paying off with increased traffic and growth in those core signature categories.","So, it looks like we\u2019ve run out of time for today. I do appreciate everyone calling in. And that will conclude our third quarter earnings call. So, thank you everyone for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. At this time, you may now disconnect."],"20333":["Target (NYSE:TGT) Q4 2012 Results Earnings Call February 27, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregg Steinhafel - Chairman, CEO, and President","Kathryn Tesija - EVP, Merchandising","John Mulligan - CFO","","Analysts","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","Bob Drbul - Barclays","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Target Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, president and chief executive officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregg Steinhafel","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our 2012 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, executive vice president of merchandising; and John Mulligan, executive vice president and chief financial officer.","This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and strategic priorities as we enter 2013. Then Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights, and upcoming initiatives. And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our outlook for 2013. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a Q&A session.","As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","We\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which reflects outstanding execution by our team during a volatile and promotional holiday season. Our U.S. operations generated fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.65, 10.1% above last year and in line with our prior guidance, even though sales fell short of our expectations. Our fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share were $1.47, reflecting Canadian segment dilution that was slightly favorable to our expectations. ","As we previously reported, fourth quarter comparable store sales in our U.S. retail segment grew 0.4% compared with an expected increase of 2-3%. In addition, our holiday season sales became even more concentrated around Black Friday and in the days leading up to and just after the Christmas holiday.","This presented challenges for both our merchandising and stores teams, who did an excellent job maintaining profitability, adjusting receipts to mitigate markdown exposure, and maintaining outstanding guest service while delivering productivity improvements. ","We are very pleased with fourth quarter sales in our digital channels, as online and mobile sales grew faster than industry averages. As a result of our efforts to improve the website throughout 2012, key performance metrics are meaningfully improved, and our mobile sales and traffic are growing at a triple-digit pace off a much smaller base.","As we\u2019ve described in the past, our investments in the website and mobile technology drive guest engagement with Target, and lead them to shop more across all of our channels. For example, following the launch of free wireless in all of our stores in the fourth quarter, Target.com was, by far, the site most commonly accessed by guests while they were shopping in our stores. As Kathy and John will describe in more detail, our plans for 2013 reflect our ongoing commitment to investing in a robust multichannel experience for our guests.","Our U.S. credit card segment maintained its long string of outsourcing quarterly results, as the portfolio is producing healthy profits in conjunction with very favorable risk metrics. We are working to complete sale of our portfolio to TD Bank Group and expect the transaction to close in this quarter. John will provide more details in a few minutes.","When we step back and view the year just ended, we are proud of the ambitious, strategic agenda and financial results we delivered. Beyond our multichannel initiatives and significant work in Canada to prepare for this year\u2019s openings, we were very pleased with the initial performance of our first five CityTarget stores, where we\u2019re seeing robust sales and traffic as well as favorable payroll expense and gross margin mix.","And, we\u2019re thrilled that our efforts on this unique urban format were recognized earlier this month when Fast Company magazine ranked Target among its top 10 most innovative companies. As we continue to hone the operational model for CityTarget, we will apply what we learn across all of our formats in the U.S. and Canada. ","In our Canadian segment, preparations for our market launch are reaching their peak. We expect to open our first 24 Canadian stores by early April, and after more than two years of effort, our Target Canada team is eager to welcome their first guests and begin generating sales. ","The former Zeller sites are being completely transformed into brand new Target stores that look terrific and feature our latest thinking in terms of layout, fixtures, and design. For the year, we expect to open 124 Canadian Target stores in five waves before the Christmas holiday season. This ambitious launch has required the team to be both nimble and disciplined, setting an outstanding example for the entire organization.","In addition to our Canadian store openings, we\u2019re planning to open 15 to 20 new stores in the U.S. this year, including three additional CityTargets. Net of closings and relocations, we expect these openings will add 10-15 new locations to the chain. Combining these expected U.S. store openings with our Canadian expansion plans, we expect to open many more new stores this year than any other year in our history. ","Also, in keeping with our commitment to invest in our existing stores, we plan to remodel just over 100 of our stores in 2013. This is a more moderate pace than in each of the past three years, as the majority of our stores now reflect our newly reinvented general merchandise format. ","This layout is much more appealing to our guests and incorporates a deeper food assortment, merchandise reinventions across the store, and a more visually compelling shopping environment.","As we enter 2013, we will plan appropriately as the U.S. economy is growing at a painfully slow rate and unemployment remains persistently high. While there are some encouraging signs in the housing market, volatility in consumer confidence, the payroll tax increase, and rise in the price of gas all present incremental headwinds.","Given these new challenges facing an already sluggish economy, we have a tempered view of the near term sales environment. However, as we have seen in the past, our guests are quite resilient. We will be vigilant in monitoring our business and our teams will be ready to capitalize on unexpected strength as they demonstrated in the first quarter last year.","We believe that we are well-positioned to succeed, even in this uncertain environment. We\u2019ll focus on providing unbeatable value and back up that commitment with our newly enhanced price match policy, which now covers offers from key online competitors year round.","We\u2019re also committed to taking smart risks on bold, innovative ideas and learning quickly from the results. We\u2019ll raise the bar in differentiation, providing our guests unique products and experiences at affordable prices. And, as Kathy will outline in more detail, we will continue to partner with designers on unique collections that embody the \u201cExpect More\u201d side of our brand promise and remind guests why Target is special.","In addition to investments in our stores, website, and award-winning mobile apps, Target Red Cards provide a key platform for our loyalty initiatives. We are seeing continued strong growth in the penetration of sales on these cards, as Red Card guests respond to the opportunity to save 5% on practically every purchase, receive free shipping every time they shop on Target.com, and benefit from an extended return policy.","As I reflect on 2012, I\u2019m incredibly proud of what the Target team has accomplished. As John will outline in a few minutes, we performed very well against all of our financial goals for the year, keeping us on track to attain our long range financial objectives despite a challenging environment.","Beyond these financial goals, a year ago we had an ambitious list of priorities for 2012, including improving the performance of Target.com following our platform relaunch in 2011; an unprecedented effort required in Canada to finish three distribution centers, begin renovating stores, build an IT solution, and hire thousands of Canadian team members; launching a completely new urban format with our first five CityTargets; finding the right partner to purchase our credit card receivables assets on appropriate financial terms; and transitioning two key positions on our executive management team. ","While this was a bold agenda, our team embraced it and emerged from the year with more energy than ever. As I mentioned, we made meaningful progress on the website, CityTarget is an operational and financial success, Canada is on track, and we\u2019re on the verge of closing the sale of our credit card receivables. And importantly, we\u2019ve added two outstanding members to our executive management team in Jeff Jones and John Mulligan.","The challenges facing us in the year ahead are more short term in nature, and I am confident in the clarity of our strategy, the power of our brand, and the strength and commitment of our talented team to achieve our goals and deliver another year of outstanding results in 2013. In other words, we are quite optimistic about our ability to successfully compete in a dynamic retail environment while generating meaningful shareholder value over time.","Now, Kathy will provide more detail on our fourth quarter results, and outline initiatives for the first quarter and beyond. Kathy? ","Kathryn Tesija ","Thanks, Gregg. Though we fell short of our overall sales goal for the fourth quarter, we were pleased that we grew comparable store sales in four of our five merchandising categories and that we sustained our profitability in the face of choppy consumer spending and an intensely competitive environment.","Consistent with the rest of the year, fourth quarter comparable store sales were strongest in our less-discretionary frequency businesses, which saw growth in the low to mid-single digits. In both of our discretionary home and apparel categories, fourth quarter comparable store sales increased in line with the company average and saw rapid growth in our digital channels.  ","Fourth quarter comparable store sales in hard lines declined in the mid single digit range and were softest in electronics. Many more electronics categories are in mature stages of the product cycle, and during the holiday season electronics constitutes the primary battleground where competitors engage in their most irrational promotions.","In toys, overall fourth quarter comparable store sales were down slightly overall, but increased about 30% through our digital channels. When we look back at our 2012 results, we\u2019re pleased that we also grew full year comparable store sales in both home and apparel, while research indicated that our guests were focused on reducing discretionary spending overall.","We achieved this outcome by gaining meaningful wallet share from our best guests and our loyalty initiatives played a key role through three separate programs in 2012. First, our PFresh remodel program is designed to drive more trips among our core guests by offering them more convenience and the ability to do more of their shopping in a store layout they love.","Second, our 5% Red Card rewards program led our guests, regardless of their previous level of engagement, to increase their shopping frequency and spending dramatically. Our research shows that on average Red Card guests shop almost 2x more per month than guests without a Red Card, and these guests shop 2.5 more departments per visit compared with non-Red Card guests.","Finally, our newest loyalty program, Pharmacy Rewards, saw phenomenal success in 2012. Pharmacy guests are already among our best guests, shopping about 3x more often than our non-pharmacy guests. However, Pharmacy Rewards guests are even more valuable, shopping on average more than 50% more often than our already valuable pharmacy guests. ","Notably, these programs complement one another, driving even stronger guest loyalty and incremental sales. For instance, guests participating in both 5% rewards and Pharmacy Rewards shopped more often and spend more across the store than guests who participate in only one of these programs. Throughout 2013 and beyond, we will explore ways to extend these programs and find new ways to drive guest engagement, traffic, and sales. ","As Gregg mentioned, fourth quarter sales grew, and our digital channels were quite strong, having accelerated throughout the year as we improved the site\u2019s stability and speed while enhancing search and navigation. These investments are clearly driving higher overall guest satisfaction and with our continued focus on expanded content and site functionality, we expect continued improvement in 2013.","We\u2019re also seeing amazing growth in traffic and sales through our mobile platforms. Mobile purchases now constitute more than 7% of our digital sales, and mobile traffic is now more than 25% of our overall digital traffic.","Guests are responding to the significant enhancements we made to our mobile offering in 2012, including improved design and navigation, becoming one of the first retailers to participate in Apple\u2019s Passbook and growing out a way-finding pilot in select stores.","As mobile continues to grow in importance, we will focus on creating in-store guest experiences and testing new technologies that make smartphones an even more useful shopping companion with enhanced product search, maps, and shopping lists.","We\u2019re also exploring ways to integrate relevant product offers and promotions with the in-store mobile shopping experience. And, of course, as a member of MCX, the Merchant Customer Exchange, we\u2019re involved in a collaborative effort among a broad group of top U.S. merchants to develop a mobile payment system that is widely accepted, secure, and easy and convenient for our guests to use.","In 2013, we\u2019re planning to increase our investment in technology and supply chain to enhance our multichannel capabilities. We will apply a test-and-learn approach to discover what our guests value most while assessing the impact on our operations. Our goal is to leverage existing assets to enable more flexibility fulfillment of our guests\u2019 shopping needs in a way that makes sense, both operationally and financially.","In 2012, through small pilots in the Twin Cities and San Francisco, we plan to test the ability for guests to pay online and pick up in store, the ability for guests to pay in one store and pick up at another store, and the ability to pay online and have items shipped from a store, including the option for same-day delivery.","We believe these tests will provide valuable information as we continue to shape our multichannel strategies. Ultimately, we expect to evolve towards more integration across our inventory and supply chain in which our stores, regional distribution centers, and web fulfillment centers all interact seamlessly to satisfy guests\u2019 wants and needs through all our channels.","After improving gradually in 2012, consumer sentiment fell sharply in the fourth quarter, reflecting turmoil surrounding the fiscal cliff and overall political uncertainty. In addition, more than 50% of U.S. consumers believe that the economy will either remain the same or get worse in 2013, and 85% indicate they expect the economy to impact their lifestyle for the next several years. ","Beyond these potential headwinds to consumer spending, the average U.S. household will see a $1,000 reduction in their after-tax income as a result of the recent increase in payroll tax rates. However, even in this challenging environment, we expect to win by strengthening guest loyalty and driving increased sales through merchandising that supports both sides of our \u201cExpect More, Pay Less\u201d brand promise.","We\u2019ll continue to match prices on identical items offered by both store-based and online competitors. And, we\u2019ll offer guests affordable products and experiences that allow them to treat themselves and their families while staying within their budgets.","For example, in apparel, we are very pleased with the response to our current designer partnership, Prabal Gurung for Target. Prabal is one of the most celebrated designers in the fashion industry, and this collection embodies his signature style and design aesthetic, all at affordable prices. The Prabal Gurung for Target collection features ready-to-wear, handbags, shoes, and jewelry that provide key differentiation for Target this spring. ","We\u2019re also very pleased with the response to our partnership with Sports Illustrated and their swimsuit issue. As you know, spring swimwear is already a signature business for Target. Through this collaboration, Sports Illustrated is creating its first style guide, which will feature original content from the publication\u2019s esteemed editorial team, specifically geared towards their female readers. This partnership reinforces Target as a swimwear destination by allowing us to reach a unique audience with our on-trend, affordable offerings.","Also this spring, Target is collaborating with Kate Young, one of the most influential stylists in the fashion industry, to introduce a limited edition collection of women\u2019s apparel, accessories, and shoes. We\u2019ve worked with Kate as a stylist for years, but for this project, she took on the role of designer, translating her unique aesthetic and ability to create memorable, red carpet moments into a standout collection for women. The Kate Young for Target collection will be available beginning April 14 at all Target stores and Target.com.  ","In home, we continue to build on the success of the Nate Berkus collection, which launched last fall. This collection includes more than 150 home products, with prices ranging from $6 to $150, featuring stylish and relatable pieces that feel like they were collected over time and designed to be easily layered into existing d\u00e9cor. We\u2019ll be adding new items to this ongoing collection in 2013.","And throughout the spring, we\u2019ll continue to roll out our threshold brand to replace Target Home. Initial results from this brand launch have been favorable, as guests respond to this fully redesigned high-quality collection that\u2019s inspiring guests to update their homes. ","In entertainment, we\u2019re following up our very successful fourth quarter partnership with Bruno Mars and One Direction with an exclusive version of Josh Groban\u2019s new album, \u201cAll That Echoes,\u201d which launched February 5. ","And, we were very excited to announce our latest partnership with Justin Timberlake during the Grammy Awards earlier this month. Target will offer an exclusive version of Justin\u2019s latest release, \u201cThe 20\/20 Experience,\u201d featuring two exclusive tracks available at Target and Target.com, beginning March 19. ","In electronics, we continue to focus on service as a value-added differentiator for our guests. In the fourth quarter, we announced that we would be ending our current relationship with Radio Shack in our mobile phone business, and would begin working with Brightstar to provide supply chain and point of sale activation and market source as our new in-store labor partner.","This change demonstrates our continued commitment to mobile as a key element of our electronics offering, and we believe it will enhance Target\u2019s position in the wireless retail marketplace. This transition will occur in early April.","Also, as you know, last October we launched a test with Geek Squad to provide in-store service agents in 20 Denver Target stores. Based on positive feedback from our guests, Target expanded this test by offering Geek Squad service and replacement plans in 20 stores in Kansas City beginning February 17. Future partnership plans will be determined following the results of these tests.","And finally, our beauty category continues to experience very strong and consistent growth on an assortment that generates better than average profitability while serving as a key differentiator for Target. As you know, last year we began testing a store service program in which dedicated consultants offer friendly guidance and expertise for guests shopping our beauty area. Based on 2012 results in 28 Chicago-area test stores, we are looking to expand this program to additional markets in 2013 and beyond.","While we remain cautious about the economy and its impact on consumer spending, we are confident in our brand, our strategy, and our merchandising and marketing plans. We believe we offer an unbeatable balance of value and excitement on both wants and needs that continues to drive guest loyalty and engagement with Target.","Now, John will share his insights on the fourth quarter and full year performance, and outlook for 2013. John?","John Mulligan  ","Thanks, Kathy. As Gregg mentioned, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of our business, particularly in the face of an intense holiday season promotional environment. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.65 is 10.1% above last year, and reflects solid performance in our U.S. retail segment, combined with continued outstanding performance in our U.S. credit card segment. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS was $1.47, $0.02 last year, as growth and adjusted EPS was offset by Canadian segment dilution. ","Before I provide more detail on our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2013, I want to pause briefly to recap our full year 2012 performance. One year ago, in my first quarterly call with all of you, I explained our plans, which would keep us on track to attain our long-range financial plan of generating $8 or more in EPS on $100 billion or more in sales in 2017. ","That 2012 plan was based on the following expectations across our three segs: U.S. comp store sales growth of 3% or more, continuation of our very healthy U.S. retail EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 10% and 7%, a moderate decline in our gross margin rate offset by leverage in SG&A and D&A, an increased Red Card penetration of 300 basis points or more throughout the year, a decline in the size of our credit card portfolio of $500 million or more with a portfolio spread to LIBOR of 7% or better, and about $0.50 of EPS dilution related to our Canadian market launch.","I also outlined that in 2012 we expected to invest a total of about $3.3 billion between the U.S. and Canada, continue our uninterrupted record of paying quarterly dividends, increase the annual dividend during the year, and invest $1.5 billion or more to repurchase our shares. Altogether, these expectations combine to an expected range of $4.55 to $4.75 in 2012 adjusted EPS and an expected GAAP EPS range of $4.05 to $4.25, reflecting expected Canadian dilution. ","Today, when you compare our actual 2012 performance against all of these metrics, you\u2019ll see we met or exceeded all of them, except for U.S. same-store sales, which we missed by 3\/10 of a point.","Altogether, we earned full year 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.76, above the range going into the year. GAAP EPS ended up well above its expected range, reflecting adjusted EPS performance, lower than expected dilution in Canada, and the gain we recognized on our credit card receivables held for sale.","This gain reflected the attainment of another one of my goals, to reach an agreement to sell the receivables portfolio to the right partner, on appropriate terms. I want to thank the entire Target team for their contributions to the achievements of our strategic and financial goals in 2012, a remarkable accomplishment, particularly in light of the environment we faced.","In the call a year ago, both Gregg and I outlined that our expectations for U.S. retail segment sales were stronger in the first three quarters of 2012 and more modest in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s clear that we got the cadence right, but the contrast between the first three quarters and the holiday season was even more pronounced than we expected. ","With that as context, let\u2019s turn to the specifics of our fourth quarter segment results. In the U.S. retail segment, fourth quarter comparable store sales increased 0.4%, driven by a 1.4% increase in average ticket, which offset a 1% decline in comparable store transactions. ","As we mentioned several times throughout 2012, our fourth quarter retail strategy was focused on providing relevant offers to core guests, profitably growing sales and market share from guests who want to shop with us all year long. We believe this strategy was effective, because despite softer than expected sales, our teams managed the business effectively and retail profitability held up remarkably well.","Our fourth quarter gross margin rate went about 60 basis points below last year, reflecting the ongoing impact of 5% Rewards and our remodel program, combined with clearance markdowns on seasonal inventory. ","In the fourth quarter, our team managed SG&A expense incredibly well, leading to a small amount of rate leverage. This is something we generally wouldn\u2019t expect on a 0.4% comp, particularly when our sales plan for the quarter was higher. ","This performance is even more noteworthy, because we were able to offset incremental expenses related to technology investments in multichannel and other initiatives. This pressure was offset by continued expense discipline across the organization and once again, our stores team was able to generate meaningful productivity improvements while providing great guest service. ","We also experienced fourth quarter leverage on the depreciation and amortization expense line, reflecting the moderate pace of U.S. capital investment in recent years, combined with the benefit from the 53rd week of sales in this fiscal year. ","In our U.S. credit card segment, performance in the fourth quarter was outstanding once again. Portfolio spread to LIBOR was $3 million higher than last year, a 27% increase, even though average receivables were more than 4% lower than a year ago.","Portfolio profitability continues to benefit from historically low delinquency and writeoff rates that continue to improve. I want to thank our financial services team. The quality of our receivables portfolio reflects their dedication and effort in managing through a recession and credit crisis worse than many of us thought possible.","The superior performance and profitability of this asset enabled us to reach a sale and servicing agreement with TD Bank, a premier financial institution that shares our goals for portfolio growth and profitability. ","In our Canadian segment, we\u2019re pleased with the plans we have in place, and we\u2019re on track to open our first 24 stores this quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded expenses related to investments in technology, supply chain, store renovations, and the team, as we continue to ramp up our efforts to open more stores in Canada in 2013 than any single year of U.S. store openings in our history.","These activities drove $118 million of SG&A expense in the fourth quarter, which, along with D&A and interest expense associated with the segment reduced our fourth quarter GAAP EPS by $0.18.","Even as we prepared for peak Canada capital investment in 2013, our business continues to generate ample cash to allow us to fund investments in our business, support the dividend, and engage in share repurchase. In the fourth quarter, we invested about $645 million to retire more than 10.4 million shares. This means that, combined with the dividend, we returned nearly $900 million to our shareholders in the fourth quarter, representing more than 90% of net earnings.","Now let\u2019s turn our attention to our plans for 2013. This year will clearly be a year of transition, which will result in some unique dynamics in our P&L. First, when we close the receivables sale with TD Bank Group, we will recognize nonrecurring accounting items related to the sale and discontinued reporting of U.S. credit card segment. ","At the same time, in the U.S. retail segment, we will begin recognizing income from profit sharing, net of accounts servicing costs, as an offset to SG&A expense. On an annualized basis, we expect this change will reduce our U.S. retail segment, SG&A rate, by about 30 basis points, leading to an equivalent increase in our U.S. retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates. Of course, the impact of full year 2013 will be less than this annualized impact. The fiscal year has already begun, and we have not yet closed the transaction. ","One housekeeping note, my guidance today will compare against last year\u2019s financial results, which included separate retail and credit card segments. Once we have closed the receivables sale, we will report performance of a single U.S. segment and compare against restated prior year results which combine our results from the former U.S. credit card segment and U.S. retail segment. ","To provide clarity on these restated comparisons, after the sale closes, we plan to furnish three years of quarterly restated U.S. segment results. While we don\u2019t have a definite closing date, we\u2019re confident it will occur before the end of the first quarter. ","Second, in the Canadian segment, we expect to transition from recording meaningful quarterly dilution in the year to recognizing accretion by the fourth quarter. And finally, I need to briefly discuss a geography change on the U.S. retail segment P&L that will influence gross margin and SG&A expense rates in 2013.","Beginning this year, we have made changes to our vendor agreements regarding payments received in support of our marketing programs. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2013, these payments will be accounted for as a reduction in our cost of sales, rather than a reduction into SG&A expense. This change will create equivalent year over year increases in both our gross margin and SG&A expense rates of 20-25 basis points, without affecting our U.S. retail EBITDA and EBIT margin rates.","So as you can see, we have a lot of changes that will create some noise in our numbers throughout the year. With that context, let\u2019s begin with a look at our 2013 expectations for our U.S. retail segment. ","As Gregg mentioned, we are ending the year with a cautious view, and might have heightened economic uncertainty, in which challenged consumers are now facing additional pressures including rapidly rising gas prices and a payroll tax increase. We\u2019re planning full year 2013 comparable store sales to grow in line with our 2012 rate of 2.7%. This growth will be combined with a moderate benefit from new square footage and offset by the comparison against this year\u2019s 53rd week, meaning total sales are expected to grow about 2%.","We expect a slightly higher U.S. retail gross margin rate, reflecting the vendor payment geography shift I mentioned above, combined with category rate improvements which should offset ongoing pressure from 5% Rewards and our remodel program. We also expect to see a slight improvement in our U.S. retail SG&A expense rate for the full year. ","This expectation reflects continued discipline throughout the organization, along with the benefit from credit card profit sharing, which will offset the geography shift in vendor payments and continued pressure from investments in technology and supply chain, including multichannel. Those investments are expected to be worth $0.20 to $0.25 of EPS in 2013. ","Altogether, we expect a 2013 U.S. retail segment EBITDA margin rate in the range of 10.3% and an expansion of the U.S. retail segment EBIT margin rate to around 7.5%, reflecting very healthy underlying performance combined with the impact of the receivables transaction I discussed earlier.","We expect to invest about $2.3 billion in the U.S. in 2013. While that amount is in line with our U.S. capital investment in 2011 and 2012, the mix continues to shift toward investments beyond our stores. In fact, for 2013, the sum of our U.S. investments in supply chain and technology, including multichannel, will likely be as high as our investments in new stores and remodels.","In the U.S. credit card segment, we expect the portfolio to continue to slowly decline in size until it stabilizes at between $5.5 billion and $6 billion. We expect the portfolio will continue to generate outstanding profitability, both before and after it is sold to TD Bank Group. And we expect delinquencies and writeoffs to stabilize near current historically low levels.","As I mentioned before, we continue to expect to close the deal before the end of the first quarter, causing GAAP EPS to reflect some one-time items, including a gain on sale and the recording of a beneficial interest receivable on our balance sheet.","We posted a document outlining those expected impacts last October when we announced the agreement, and it\u2019s still available on the website. If you have additional questions about these one-time items, John Hulbert and I will be happy to discuss them with you after this call.","Beyond expected one-time items that we\u2019ll exclude from our adjusted EPS measure, we continue to expect the transaction will reduce our adjusted EPS by about $0.10 in the 12 months following the closing, compared with a scenario in which we kept the portfolio. ","This impact reflects the sharing of a portion of the portfolio of profits for TD, partially offset by the benefit of reduced interest expense and lower share count as we deploy proceeds from the sale. We expect to provide more color on the impact of the sale once the closing date for the transaction is known. ","Turning to the Canadian segment, as we\u2019ve discussed with many of you, the sites we obtained in the Zellers deal were extremely well located with very attractive leases. They were notably smaller than stores we opened in the U.S., and in very poor physical condition. As a result, when we announced the Zellers deal, we indicated that we expected to invest $10-11 million per existing building to make them into brand new Target stores.","Also at the time, we indicated that we were working with Canadian landlords to understand which of those sites might have adjacent open space and whether we would have an opportunity to invest capital in an expansion when it made financial sense. As a result of these discussions, I\u2019m happy to tell you that of the 124 stores we expect to open in 2013, we have decided to expand 40 sites beyond the space they occupied as Zeller stores, creating more than 600,000 square feet of incremental retail selling space.","For each expansion, we have made a separate underwriting decision in which we measured the added investment against the incremental cash flow we believe a larger building will generate. All in, we expect to invest about $1.5 billion of capital in the Canadian segment in 2013, as we complete renovations and expansions for this year\u2019s openers, and begin work on additional stores to open in 2014. ","In 2013, we expect Canadian segment to generate approximately $0.45 of dilution to our GAAP EPS, as the cost to open and operate Canadian stores, along with the depreciation related to our capital investments, offsets the profitability we generate from the locations after they open. Dilution is expected to exceed $0.45 through the first three quarters, after which we expect the segment to contribute several cents of positive GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter. ","Even with total 2013 capital investment close to $4 billion, we expect to return meaningful amounts of capital to shareholders. Specifically, we expect to continue our uninterrupted record of paying quarterly dividends, and we recommend that our board improve another increase to the annual dividend later in the year. In addition, in 2013 we expect to be able to invest another $1.5 billion or so in share repurchase beyond the $600 million or more we expect to invest in share repurchase as a result of the receivables sale.","Finally, we expect our 2013 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.7% to 36.7%. Altogether, these expectations lead to a full year 2013 adjusted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.05. Many of you will note that the center point of this range would put us slightly below the smooth path to attaining our long range financial plan in the U.S. This reflects the fact that 2013 is indeed a year of transition, including an expected $0.08 to $0.09 of near term dilution to adjusted EPS from the receivables sale that should [unintelligible] neutrality, and ultimately accretion over the next few years.","We remain fully committed and on track to attain our long range financial plan of $8 or more in earnings per share in 2017. For full year 2013, we expect full year GAAP EPS will be about $0.15 than adjusted EPS, reflecting $0.45 of dilution related to our Canadian segment, offset by one-time accounting impacts of the receivables sale.","Let\u2019s turn finally to our expectations for the quarter. In the U.S. retail segment, as you know, in addition to economic uncertainty we face a tough comparison due to the exceptionally strong sales we delivered in the first quarter of last year. As a result, we expect to generate first quarter comparable store sales sales growth of 0% to 2% in the U.S. ","Like some others that have reported, sales results have been softer than expected so far in February, and daily volatility has been elevated. Yet trends have improved somewhat as the month has progressed, and it\u2019s still early in the quarter, so we believe our guidance is appropriate.","In the U.S. retail segment, we expect our first quarter EBITDA margin rate to be somewhat higher than last year, driven by improvements in both our gross margin and SG&A expense rates. Our gross margin forecast anticipates category rate improvements, combined with the impact of the vendor payment geography shift, which are expected to offset ongoing pressure from 5% Rewards and our store remodel program.","Our SG&A forecast anticipates continued expense discipline throughout the organization, combined with the impact of [unintelligible] portfolio profit sharing, which we expect to offset vendor payment geography and continued pressure from our multichannel investments. We also expect some leverage on D&A compared with last year. ","Together, these expectations for our U.S. retail segment lead to expected first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 to $1.20. Looking to Canada, we expect that the first quarter will mark the peak of dilution attributable to this segment, at about $0.23. However, this is expected to be more than offset by accounting gains from the receivables sale, leading to an expectation of first quarter GAAP EPS in the range of $1.22 to $1.32.","One comment on the expected cadence of the U.S. sales throughout 2013. Within our first quarter outlook, we obviously expect comparable store sales growth to strengthen later in the year, namely in the second and third quarters. Like last year, we have an appropriately tempered view of fourth quarter sales.","As I mentioned earlier, 2013 will be a transition year, not just for our P&L, but for our capital plan as well, as we expect peak investment in Canada, the mix of our U.S. capital investment to move increasingly into technology and distribution in support of our multichannel strategy, and we divest our credit card receivables assets. ","Following this year, our current view of 2014 has us fully on, or above, the path outlined in our long-range financial plan, benefitting from Canadian segment accretion and a meaningful increase in the amount of capital available to return to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Gregg for a few brief closing remarks. ","Gregg Steinhafel ","That concludes today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now, Kathy, John, and I will be happy to respond to your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley. ","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley","Could you give us a little outlook on what free cash flow is going to look like once Canada is over on the $1.5 billion of spend? And where do you expect to deploy that? Is it going to be tilted more towards share repurchase, or how do you look at that? ","Gregg Steinhafel ","Obviously this year, 2013, will be peak capital investment in Canada, about $1.5 billion. Next year, going forward, capex for the U.S. we\u2019d expect something similar, perhaps growing a little bit, $2.5 billion, something in that range, Canada dropping to somewhere - we\u2019re still opening a fair number of stores, a half a billion, perhaps a bit more than that. So we would expect free cash flow to expand, especially in light of Canada operations becoming accretive. ","As far as what we would intend to do with that, we said first, by 2017, assuming we get to $8 a share, we would expect the dividend to be at $3 a share or more, so we\u2019d expect to continue to increase the dividend at a rate approximately 20% on a compound basis over the next several years. And, with the constraint of living within our current strong investment grade credit ratings, we\u2019d expect to deploy the remainder of our excess cash flow as share repurchase. ","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley","And can you give us a little more color on the Canada dilution of $0.45? I think that\u2019s bigger than a lot of people were expecting. It sounds like a lot of it is related to the capital spending decision. So if you could walk us through that a little bit.","Gregg Steinhafel ","I think that\u2019s right, Mark. When we look back, where we\u2019re at right now with Canada, we feel really good about where we\u2019re at in our projections for returns in Canada. If we look back a year ago or even two years ago, and we sign the deal, our projected EBITDA for this year, is essentially right on where we thought it would be. ","The dilution is a bit higher even than we expected perhaps a year ago, and all of that is attributable to independent capital investment decisions we\u2019ve made, whether that\u2019s investing in three distribution centers to build them and own them ourselves, or the 40 store expansions that I mentioned that we worked through over the past year. So most of the increase from our vantage point is attributable to incremental depreciation and amortization. ","And of course those capital investments were separate economic decisions, and we expect to see economic benefit to that P&L through time, but the sequencing is that the depreciation and amortization shows up first. ","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley ","And also, you talked about the percent rent clauses in Canada. I know you got out of some of those.","Gregg Steinhafel ","Yeah, the property development team did an outstanding job working with some very good partners, our landlords in Canada, and the vast majority of the percent rent clauses, which of course never impacted Zellers, have been negotiated away. Percent rent is not a meaningful issue for us going forward.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. ","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","I have a couple of questions. First, John, on the leverage, once credit\u2019s gone, we get your debt to EBITDAR around 1.7, 1.8, could you put some context into how high you think that can or should go, given everything in terms of being great credit rating, as you take the dividend out?  Should we model sort of a 2 as a capital? How should we think about that? ","John Mulligan ","I think what I would say is right now as we look at the retail business and model that, we\u2019ve always modeled that kind of independently of the credit business, given the different leverage characteristics, as you noted. We think the retail business right now is probably pretty close to the top end. There may be a little bit of room. But we think it\u2019s near about where the leverage which will support our current credit rating is at.","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","So the incremental buyback is really the equity from the credit business?","John Mulligan ","Correct, for 2013 that\u2019s correct.","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","And then secondly, maybe a bigger question for Kathy or Gregg, the Red Card growth, compared to, say, three years ago, has, I think, beaten all of our expectations. Certainly mine. It looks like last year it was up over 50%. Could you help us understand a little bit more about that 50% growth in Red Card sales? How much of it is from new Red Card members? How much of it is existing members spending more? Anything you could provide there would be helpful.","Gregg Steinhafel ","Sure, the increase in Red Card sales is a mix of both. Certainly the new accounts are creating a significant amount of that lift, with the amount of accounts. And you know, you can see the increased penetration resulting from new accounts. But we have also seen increased lift, particularly over the first several quarters that the Red Card was out in existing accounts. ","The other thing I would mention, the big driver here of the increase in sales, as has been the case, the big driver in the increase of the whole program, has been the debit card, and I think from our assumptions perhaps two or three years ago, when we were talking to you to now, the debit card is the one that has really surprised us. ","The credit card has probably gone pretty much with what we thought, but the debit card, we\u2019re doing three accounts to one debit to credit now, and that has been the product that is incredibly attractive to consumers who just don\u2019t want another credit card. And that\u2019s really what has driven the significant increase in our Red Card sales. ","John Mulligan ","The other thing that I would add is all of our guest segments love the Red Card somewhat equally, whether you\u2019re a VIP, which we would say is somebody who visits us a lot and spends a lot, all the way through our enthusiasts, convenience users, least engaged. All of those segments, once they get the Red Card, move toward visiting Target more often and spending more. So this is not just isolated in one group or demographic. It\u2019s very well dispersed and balanced. And we think that\u2019s a very positive attribute, that that many guest segments love the Red Card. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray. ","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ","Maybe just first, John, a clarification question on the $8 in EPS for 2017. I think before that was predicated on a 2% or more U.S. annual U.S. store growth. Do you still think that\u2019s the appropriate number to get to that $7.20 from the U.S. business?","John Mulligan ","The actual assumption for the U.S. business was about a 3 comp through time, and you know, some years will be a little bit above that, some years a little bit below that. But we think 3 comp is about the right level for our business. If you look back at our business over a really really long period of time, you know, back when we were running 5 comps, a couple hundred basis points of that were coming from new stores as they annualized, and we ran about a 3 comp in our base business. And over the last couple of years, since 2010, last year a little bit lower, 2011 right on, we feel like that\u2019s the right neighborhood for where we can run the business.","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ","And then also on the guidance for this year, and just thinking about the modeling, it sounds like you\u2019re opening up a few more waves in Canada than your normal store opening cadence. Just from a modeling perspective, how should we think about some of those store openings this year? And then just as a follow up to the U.S., how does the real estate development market feel to you guys out there?","Gregg Steinhafel ","Well, typically in the U.S. we open stores in three cycles. Due to the number of stores we had in Canada, we\u2019re taking the approach that we\u2019re going to open five cycles this year. So think April, May, and every couple of months beyond that, we\u2019re going to open somewhere between 20 and 28 stores a cycle. ","We haven\u2019t defined all of that yet, but we\u2019re going to start in the greater Toronto area, then we\u2019re going to move to Western Canada, then we\u2019ll densify, then we\u2019ll go east, and then we\u2019ll densify again. So we\u2019ve got a good plan that is centered around our supply chain investments and the readiness of our distribution centers, and we just think it makes sense to spread out those kinds of openings over more cycles than we typically would do in the U.S.","And your other question?","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ","Just how does the U.S. real estate development market feel in the U.S.? Does it feel like it\u2019s loosening up a little bit? Maybe a few more opportunities, you guys are holding back a little bit at this point, and looking to be a little bit more prudent in the growth?","Gregg Steinhafel ","We\u2019re not holding back at all. We\u2019re not capital constrained, and we\u2019re pursuing every project that we can find that\u2019s going to generate the right kind of a return. So I would tell you that the commercial real estate market is pretty much status quo, and hasn\u2019t changed all that much over the last couple of years. ","There are pockets of opportunity, and we\u2019re anxious to either codevelop or develop on our own, or be a partner in any development where we believe that it\u2019s the right demographics, and we can generate the right kind of return. So we\u2019re not holding back at all. It\u2019s just the environment is still a little cautious and a lot slower than we\u2019d like it to be, and hopefully things will change over the next couple of years.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. ","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","John, can you give us a sense of what the revenue assumption is that\u2019s baked into that $0.45 Canada dilution number this year?","John Mulligan ","The revenue number I would tell you continues to move around even here for the reasons Gregg just outlined. Store opening schedules continue to move around. We\u2019ve only really set in place in concrete the first two. The rest of them still moving around a little bit. So we\u2019re hesitant to provide pretty specific guidance. But what I would tell you is the expectation is that these stores will open and grow and have a very similar annualization process to what we see in the U.S. So I think that\u2019s probably the most important assumption, and the revenue will move around based on what stores we get open when.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","And then I think in the past you guys have said that you\u2019d expect to recapture the Canadian losses that you accrue within two years of turning profitable. So if you sum up the last three years - well, the last two years plus this year - it\u2019s a little over $1, maybe $1.10. Do you still expect to get that back in earnings from Canada in \u201914 or \u201915? Or is the D&A going to make that a longer process?","Gregg Steinhafel ","Yeah, I think you hit on it. It will be a little bit longer. We\u2019re not talking about five years or anything like that, but 2.5, 3 years, something like that our current modeling would say we\u2019ll get it back in. Something like that. So a bit more than 2 years.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays. ","Bob Drbul - Barclays","Just had a question on the fourth quarter in general. Over the past few years, you guys have really made a nice tradeoff between profitability and comps, and this year it seemed to break down a little bit more than usual, where you\u2019ve made a decision not to be a Black Friday door buster competitor, but the gross margins were down 60 basis points or so. Can you talk a little bit about what you learned from the traffic being down and gross margins being down, sort of how you might attack it differently in the fourth quarter of this year?","Kathryn Tesija ","You know, Bob, I would say that we actually think we performed quite well on Black Friday. We saw the barbell intensify as Gregg mentioned, between those early sales in Black Friday, and then the lull and then coming back strong at the end of the holiday. ","For us it was more about pretty weak seasonal businesses. The weather, as you know, was very warm, and our seasonal businesses, which normally kick in in early November, didn\u2019t. And then with all of the, we think, economic turmoil and the elections, and fiscal cliff, and all of that, that it created that lull in between Black Friday and Christmas. ","So we\u2019ve talked about planning conservatively for this past year, and we will again for next year for the fourth quarter. And we think that the opportunity to pick up sales is really the other three quarters. And in particular, the second and third quarters this year. So we continue to manage our business, our goal is to maintain or grow gross margins within categories. ","As you know, it was a very competitive year this year, and what we dropped was mainly reflecting the ongoing impact of 5% Rewards and PFresh combined with a little higher clearance in some of our seasonal categories. ","But all in all, I think the team did a great job of managing our inventory. We did come out very clean. Our inventory headed into the first quarter was exactly where it was last year on a per-store basis. So we feel great about that. ","Gregg Steinhafel ","The other thing I would add is you have to take a look at the mix of our business too and there was industry softness in electronics and toys, which are really important to us. There was not any must-have really super-hot new products that really drove consumers into the stores. And as others have reported, the toy business was a little softer than expected. And the same was true in electronics, as we were post-peak in terms of the digital cycles and video game business in particular were softer, and that\u2019s a huge business for us. ","So just the cyclical nature of some of these businesses, in addition to what Kathy said, caused comps to be a bit softer than we expected. But we are not bashful about being hypercompetitive, and we want to be really super competitive every year as we head into the holiday season. But we also want to have a balanced approach in making sure that it\u2019s not all about market share. We want to gain market share, but do so profitably, and trying to find that right mix. And that\u2019s the approach we\u2019ll continue to take. ","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ","On a similar topic of competition, obviously you introduced the price match guarantee as a step in the right direction. But given that that\u2019s such a very low portion of the total transactions, do you think you need to do more on just everyday price and staying more competitive than perhaps you even are today?","Gregg Steinhafel ","Well, we\u2019re competitive day in and day out. We have always maintained the position that we\u2019re going to be competitive in the marketplace. That\u2019s a position that we\u2019ve taken, and as we continue to learn more, and as more business migrates to the online channels, we\u2019re going to continue to sharpen up our online prices in that channel as well, and be competitive with those competitors that are most meaningful in that channel.","So there will be some sharpening up there, but I would tell you, we offer fantastic value day in and day out. Our pricing strategy has not changed, and as we look across the competitive landscape, we\u2019re very, very well-positioned.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ","Just one more if I could. Can you just walk us through the path to $0.10 dilution getting to neutral over a few years? What causes that to happen, on the credit card sale?","John Mulligan ","The biggest impact is the impact of share repurchase as that levers against growing profits is the short story on that, Dan, and we\u2019re happy to spend a little bit more time with you if you\u2019d like. But that\u2019s the short story.","","Okay, well, thank you very much. That concludes Target\u2019s fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Welcome to the Target Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 20, 2015.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John R. Hulbert - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.","This morning, Brian will discuss our first quarter performance and priorities going forward then Kathee will provide insights into our first quarter results across our merchandise category and plans for the second quarter and beyond, and finally, John will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance and expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Also, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his perspective on our first quarter performance. Brian?","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. We're very pleased with our first quarter financial results which we announced earlier this morning. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.10 is 19.6% higher than last year and $0.05 better than the high-end of the range we provided at the beginning of the quarter. Comp sales increased 2.3% in the quarter, a bit ahead of our expectation. This increase was driven by a healthy balance of growth in both traffic and average ticket. First quarter digital sales increased 38% over last year driven by higher traffic and a substantial increase in conversion. Digital growth contributed 80 basis points to our comp sales increase in the first quarter.","While we enjoyed a healthy pace of sales throughout the first quarter, we saw particularly strong results in March, as weather warmed across many parts of the country and Easter timing moved seasonal sales into the month. In April, we were thrilled with the overwhelming demand for items from our collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer, with most of the collection selling out in the first few days. We were disappointed, however, that our digital channels were not able to properly accommodate the surge in traffic at the time of the launch, and the team is working to address root causes and learn from the experience as we prepare for holiday season peak later this year.","The first quarter saw a meaningful increase in our gross margin rate as we cycled over a promotional first quarter of 2014, and we benefited from very strong mix of sales in our signature categories this year, both in stores and online. First quarter comp sales in signature categories grew more than twice as fast as our comparable sales overall and mix in our digital channels was even stronger. Specifically, about two-thirds of our first quarter digital sales increase was driven by growth in Home and Apparel. Kathee will provide more detail on category performance in a few minutes.","Once again, our stores did a great job controlling costs this quarter, while outside of the stores we continued to move to a leaner, more agile way of working. During the first quarter, we recorded restructuring charges related to head count reductions at our headquarters. While these reductions were very difficult for all of us, I strongly believe they were a necessary step to remove roadblocks which were preventing us from moving more quickly and responsively to the guests' needs. I want to thank the team for their perseverance during this time of significant transition. I continue to admire the energy they bring to work every single day.","As you know, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase over time, and I'm very pleased that this quarter we began returning cash through share repurchase for the first time in nearly two years. This change reflects the improving health of our U.S. business along with the cash flow benefit of our fourth quarter decision to discontinue operations in Canada.","For several quarters now, I've been talking about the five priorities we're focused on as a leadership team: becoming a leader in delivering shopping on demand for our guests; establishing clear roles in our merchandising categories, with particular focus on growing our signature categories, Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness; developing capabilities to become more localized in our store experience and more personalized in our digital interaction with guests; continue to develop and test urban formats like CityTarget and TargetExpress; and finally, transforming the way we work to create capacity to invest appropriately in the growth initiatives I just described.","I strongly believe if we make progress on these five priorities over the next few years, Target will deliver outstanding financial results and become an even stronger retailer. While we're at the early stages, I'm encouraged with signs of progress on these efforts. Specifically, our strong mix of first quarter sales in signature categories demonstrates the value of the work to define category roles. We continue to rollout upgraded fixtures in Apparel, Beauty, Baby and Home while investing in Wellness with programs like Made to Matter. Our buying teams are focused on delivering enhanced newness, quality, and value to our guests and we're communicating this renewed focus in both traditional and digital channels.","Our digital sales growth of nearly 40% on top of 30% growth a year ago shows that we have a meaningful opportunity to generate comp sales growth through investments in digital channels. And following our March head count reductions at headquarters, our teams are taking a fresh look at everything we do and taking steps to remove approval layers and increase the speed of decision-making. While there will certainly be a meaningful adjustment process, I believe we will emerge with an agile and engaged team that is equipped and empowered to act quickly on behalf of the guest.","These signs of progress are meaningful to the team and demonstrate the value of our efforts, and validate our strategic priorities. Yet, as we look ahead, we realize we're on a much longer journey and need to accomplish many more things. Specifically, we're in the very early stages of our work on localization and personalization. In the future, these efforts should benefit both sales and gross margin rate.","And while we're still in the testing phase, we're very encouraged by the progress in evaluating and rolling out urban formats, like CityTarget and TargetExpress. We opened two new Express locations in the San Francisco market this quarter, both of which are quite different from our first location in the Minneapolis market. We expect to open six more locations this year in a variety of markets and demographic areas to continue to learn how to operate this new format in a diverse array of sizes and settings.","Finally, we are just beginning to reinvent our food assortment and presentation. We have an opportunity to drive more traffic and sales in this critical area of the store by becoming more specialized in our assortment, more focused on healthy options in support of wellness. We're testing potential assortment and presentation options and this year we plan to study the guest response to potential changes before determining what we'll rollout more extensively next year.","While this quarter's results are encouraging, we're focused on the work ahead of us as we transform ourselves to become a truly modern retailer and more relevant to our guests. We're taking the necessary steps, both in our investment decisions and the way we work, to position Target for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. The momentum we've seen so far makes us more confident than ever that we're moving the right direction and encourages us to move even faster. Yet we know that long-term success depends on achieving the right balance between speed and the time it takes to confirm we're making the right changes that we can execute at scale. Once we have that confirmation, we're committed to moving forward both quickly and confidently to becoming the retailer our guests want Target to be.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kathee to recap our first quarter results and plans going forward.","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","Thanks, Brian. In the first quarter, we saw encouraging trends across many dimensions of our business including traffic, sales, merchandise mix, markdown rates, digital channel growth, and overall profitability. Within our sales, our results reflect our continued focus on growing signature categories. Beauty had another outstanding quarter and delivered more than a 5% comp but Apparel and Home were right behind with a mid-4% comp. Given weather trends and Easter timing, Apparel comps peaked in March but were strong throughout the quarter. Among the drivers was swim, where we saw better-than-expected results across the board in women's, men's, and kids. In ready-to-wear, we saw particular strength in Merona and our new plus-size brand, Ava & Viv. And while it's small relative to the quarter, the response to the Lilly Pulitzer partnership was the icing on the cake as more than 90% of the Apparel items sold out the first day.","Across the rest of our assortment, food comps were just below the company average and hardlines experienced a mid-single-digit comp decline, reflecting a very tough comparison to last year when we saw particularly strong sales from Disney's Frozen and elevated promotions drove sales in electronics. As Brian mentioned, first quarter comparable sales were driven by a healthy combination of growth in both traffic and average ticket. Within average ticket, an increase in average retail was partially offset by a decline in units per transaction. This decline in average units was driven by category mix, particularly Apparel along with channel mix, as digital transactions typically have fewer units at higher average retail.","Besides channel mix, growth in average retail was driven by a lower level of promotional activity this year and a trend in which our guests are trading up to higher quality and premium branded items. We were really pleased with the pace of digital channel sales growth this quarter and even happier that it was driven by Home and Apparel. But our digital goals are ambitious and we have a lot more work to do, so we're continuing to invest in and roll out new initiatives to maintain our momentum.","The February launch of a lower $25 free shipping threshold drove a meaningful increase in conversion this quarter and guests continue to embrace store pickup, which was up more than 100% from a year ago.","Subscriptions are also growing rapidly. Sales on subscription grew 32% between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and the active subscriber base grew 20% within the first quarter. And we continue to see great results from our ship-from-store capability, which delivers shipping savings for us and reduced delivery times for our guests, and we expect to roll out this capability to more than 200 additional stores this fall.","As I mentioned in the last call, we were very happy to see the West Coast port situation resolved, yet we knew it would take a few months for the shipping backlog to be completely relieved. As of today, I am pleased to say that those delays are fully behind us. Consistent with our fourth quarter experience, the team did a great job in the first quarter working around port-related issues by pre-ordering inventory and rerouting shipments. However, despite these efforts, some categories including shoes, saw spotty in-stocks in the quarter and saw sales accelerate as receipts began to flow and in-stocks recovered.","As we look ahead, we are working to build on our current momentum in the second quarter and beyond. In Apparel, beyond swim, we've been seeing encouraging trends in shorts, dresses, tanks, and sandals, and expect these businesses to be a key driver of second quarter sales.","In jewelry and accessories, this morning, we announced a new limited time partnership, Eddie Borgo for Target that launches July 12. Eddie has crafted a first-of-its-kind limited edition collection of customizable jewelry, accessories, and wall art featuring the designers' signature aesthetic and on-trend colors and finishes.","In Home, we're seeing great momentum in our tabletop business and we'll expand the offering this quarter with a broader selection of both indoor and outdoor options for summer entertaining. We're also excited (15:03) programs which will launch in July featuring more exclusive content from licensed and exclusive brands and do-it-yourself programs which will allow students to decorate their own journals, notebooks, and lockers.","In Wellness, we continue to see amazing results from the Made to Matter collection. Since the announcement of this collection, featured brands are running up 25% to last year and the collection is on track to record $1 billion in sales this year.","And in Kids, we have a blockbuster set of licensed programs planned for the second quarter and beyond. In stores now, we're offering about 150 items from the new Avengers movie including many that are exclusive to Target. To support the release, we've created an omni-channel marketing campaign that includes social media engagement and a uniquely creative stop-motion broadcast spot that brings the actual 12-inch action figures to life. Also this summer, looks for exclusive items across multiple categories in celebration of the June release of Jurassic World and the July release of Minions.","On target.com, we've expanded our licensed offering by creating experiences for our top 29 licenses. Each of these experiences includes favorite items that we carry in both channels plus extended assortments that include collectibles, more apparel choices, and hard-to-find toys. We will continue to roll out experiences to more of our favorite characters throughout the year.","To celebrate the 65th anniversary of the iconic comic strip, Peanuts, we're rolling out a summer collection of more than 100 exclusive products. These items are the work of our own product design and development team who partnered with current Peanuts cartoonist and the Charles M. Schulz Museum to design fresh, fun items that are true to the comic strip's roots. We'll roll out more exclusive items across multiple categories throughout the year leading up to the release of the new Peanuts feature film in November.","And finally, like moviegoers, we're already excited about the December movie release from the most famous license of them all, Star Wars. Earlier this month, as part of the worldwide 'May the 4th Be With You' event, we allowed Darth Vader and Yoda to take over the target.com homepage, offering special online-only deals on Star Wars licensed product. We'll provide more details on our next earnings call but for now I can assure you that Star Wars fans will find plenty of reasons to visit our stores and target.com this year.","As we said many times, we're encouraged by our progress but recognize that we are only at the beginning of a multi-year journey to transform our business. We continue to roll out new store fixtures to enhance the shopping experience in Apparel, Baby, Electronics, and Home, and we're working quickly to develop and test ideas to reinvent our food area to become more specialized and more clearly embrace Wellness with local products, naturals, organics, and clean labels.","And we continue to invest in our technology and supply chain capabilities to allow our guests to shop on demand and receive products where and when they want. The good news is that even though we have much more to do, the positive guest response to what we've already accomplished makes us confident we are moving in the right direction.","Now, I'll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter and beyond.","John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better-than-expected sales performance particularly in our signature categories. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was $0.05 above the high-end of the guidance range provided at the beginning of the quarter. First quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 about $0.09 lower than adjusted EPS driven primarily by pre-tax restructuring costs of $103 million combined with small adjustments for breach-related expenses and the favorable resolution of income tax matters. First quarter GAAP EPS of $0.98 included a $0.03 loss on discontinued Canadian operations compared with a $0.24 loss on Canadian operations in the first quarter 2014.","Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 2.3% was just ahead of the guidance of 2% we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We were pleased with the sales results throughout the quarter but they were particularly strong in March as weather warmed and Easter timing moved seasonal sales into the month. Comparable sales growth for March and April combined which eliminates the effective Easter timing was stronger than we experienced in February.","Digital channel sales increased 38% in the first quarter on top of more than 30% growth in the first quarter last year. Digital channels drove about 80 basis points of our first quarter comparable sales increase in line with our fourth quarter experience. Comparable transactions were up both in the store and digital channels accounting for approximately 90 basis points of our comp increase. REDcard penetration of 21.5% was about 110 basis points ahead of last year, in line with our expectations. This growth is faster than our fourth quarter pace and consistent with new account growth in the latter half of 2014.","Risk levels on the portfolio continue to run at historically low levels and this quarter we saw an increase in payment rates. This increase is consistent with commentary from others and potentially explains what consumers are choosing to do with some of their savings from lower gas prices. One other note; we've now begun piloting acceptance of chip transactions at our stores as the entire U.S. payment industry prepares to move to chip technology later in the year.","Our first quarter segment EBITDA margin rate of 10.5% was stronger than expected, driven by an unexpectedly strong gross margin rate. Specifically, our first quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was nearly a percentage point higher than year ago. This year's rate benefited from lower markdowns as we annualized the last year's promotional activity following the data breach and we saw a very favorable mix of sales in our signature category. In fact, the last two quarters are the only two in recent history in which sales mix has been a positive contributor to our overall gross margin rate. This shows the value of our focus on driving growth in our signature category. This quarter, we grew sales and traffic while replacing promotionally-driven sales on lower margin items with higher margin sales in signature categories, and the benefit to our P&L was compelling.","On the SG&A expense line, this quarter we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage of pay and benefits, partially offset by higher technology expense compared with the year ago. Altogether, our first quarter segment SG&A expense rate improved about 20 basis points compared with last year.","Before I leave our segment discussion, I want to comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter which was about 9% higher than a year ago. This increase was intentional and reflects some decisions we've discussed in the past calls. First, beginning last summer, we increased our inventory commitment in commodity categories to support in-stocks in these frequency driving businesses. And second, our receipts this quarter reflected some pre-buying of imported product that the team had undertaken to mitigate risk before the West Coast port slowdown had been resolved. Looking ahead, we continue to feel very good about our overall inventory level and we expect year-over-year growth to moderate in the second quarter and beyond.","Moving to consolidated metrics. First quarter interest expense was essentially flat to last year and we've returned $333 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. As we mentioned during the last call, the improvements in our business results and cash balance have positioned us to once again return cash through share repurchase, within the limits of our capital structure goals. As a result, this quarter we bought back shares for the first time since the second quarter of 2013, investing $297 million in open market repurchases and another $265 million through an accelerated share repurchase agreement late in the quarter. This means that in the quarter we returned over 140% of our net income through dividends and share repurchase.","Given our current cash position and continued strong cash generation by our business, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the second quarter and beyond and believe we will have the capacity to retire $2 billion or more of our shares in this fiscal year, within the limits of our current investment-grade credit ratings. One note, we ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, meaning that if this activity continues as expected we would exhaust the current authorization later this year. As a result, we will be reviewing with our board the need to increase our share repurchase authorization at an upcoming meeting.","Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss our decision to begin reporting after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations, or ROIC, in this quarter's earnings press release. As you know from our previous discussions and the long-term performance incentives described in our proxy statement, we believe ROIC is an important metric to measure the quality of our capital allocation decisions over time. Also, as you know, we presented our long-term aspirations for this metric during our Financial Community Meeting in March. Specifically, we intend to reach the mid-teens or higher on this metric over the next five years.","Beginning this quarter, we'll report how we have performed on this metric for the most recent trailing 12 months, providing clarity on how we are measuring our own performance while allowing everyone to track our progress. To provide additional context, we're posting the last two years of quarterly calculations of this metric on our Investor Relations website in the Summary Financials section. With that backdrop, this morning we reported that for the trailing 12 months through first quarter 2015, our after-tax return on invested capital was 12.5%, up about 60 basis points from a year before, reflecting improved profitability on a relatively stable base of invested capital in our continuing operations.","Now let's move to our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we expect our comparable sales to increase between 2% and 2.5%, reflecting expected growth in digital channel sales in the high-30% range. Both of these expectations are similar to our first quarter performance and, while it is still early, our results through the first few weeks of the second quarter are consistent with that forecast. We expect our second quarter gross margin rate to improve about 50 basis points from last year as we benefit from the comparison to last year's promotional activity while we continue to make price investments and add quality back into our owned and exclusive brand products.","On the SG&A expense line, we expect our second quarter rate will be 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher than a year ago as the rate benefit from productivity improvement is expected to be offset by a planned year-over-year increase in compensation expense. You'll recall that compensation expense was unusually low in the second quarter last year as we significantly reduced our accrual for full-year incentive compensation in light of softening financial performance. Combining our gross margin and expense rate expectations, we're looking for improvement in our second quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates of 20 basis points to 30 basis points compared with last year.","Second quarter interest expense is expected to be about $150 million, well below last year, which was unusually high due to the retirement of some high coupon debt. Our effective tax rate is expected to be just over 35%, higher than last year's 33.7% rate, driven by improved profitability. Altogether, these expectations would lead to second quarter adjusted EPS, representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business of $1.04 to $1.14 compared with $1.01 a year ago.","While we've seen a strong start to the year so far, it is early and we have a lot more to accomplish as the year progresses. However, our first quarter performance validates that we are focused on the right strategic priorities to propel our business forward and it certainly adds to our confidence that we can deliver on our guidance for the year. As a result, we've taken the lower-end of our prior full year guidance up by $0.05 and now expect full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $4.50 to $4.65.","With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee, and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question will come from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Co.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Congratulations on really solid results. We're very pleased to hear about all the progress. Regarding the comps in the back half, should we think about traffic as the main opportunity, or do you feel like ticket will also be an opportunity? And as we think about gross margin and your product assortment, how are you balancing the idea of investing in price versus the innovation that you're conducting in your signature categories?","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oliver, good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As we think about the balance of the year, I would ask you to think about three important variables, and you saw those come to life in the first quarter. We're clearly focused on driving traffic to our stores and we expect that to be a very important driver of our growth over the balance of the year. But you're also seeing the benefit of our focus on signature categories and the higher ticket that that generates. But importantly, the third element is the increasingly important contribution we're seeing from our digital and online businesses. So as we go forward, we're going to continue to make sure we're seeing growth in traffic, growth in our signature categories that leads to that gross margin rate improvement we saw in first quarter and the higher ticket, but importantly the ongoing contribution of our online channel.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Brian, you've been very agile with strategic decisions around the online and digital business. As we look forward to back-to-school and holiday, are there any key pointers in terms of the strategies you're undertaking, particularly as mobile and shipping continue to be hot topics?","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Oliver, you heard Kathee talk about some of the key initiatives that came to life in the first quarter, and you're going to continue to see us build off of that over the balance of the year. We've completely rebuilt our app. We're focused on improving our subscription and registry. We're leveraging our stores to ship to our guests. So we're going to continue to build on those initiatives as we go forward and continue to make sure that we're making the investments both in technology but, importantly, in the supply chain that brings that online business to life for our guests.","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","And, Oliver, if we can go back for a minute to your question on thinking about price versus innovation and how do we balance those, I would just say that we start from the guests, looking at what it is that they expect from any given product category, and then how do we build the very best product which is depending on what it is, could be a combination of both price and innovation or more heavily leaning on one or the other depending on what we're talking about. But very much guest-focused to make sure that we're offering them the content that's going to inspire them and resonate. So there's not one size fits all. It's really guest-focused, driven by each category.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Congrats. And that was very clear on Lilly Pulitzer. Congrats on that as well. Best regards.","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","Thank you.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oliver, thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. And I'll add my congrats as well. My first question is on gross margin. Does the gross margin guidance assume a continued mix shift to the signature categories that you enjoyed this quarter? And is the formula for Q2 in terms of price and quality investments, kind of, what we should be thinking going forward, i.e., you were down about 100 last year, and you recapture about half, according to your guidance. Does that seem like a reasonable formula for Q3 as well?","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start with the gross margin and the focus for not only the quarter but for many years to come. And we've been very clear about the importance of focusing in on our signature categories. We believe that's our path to differentiating the brand. So you should continue to expect us to focus on building our style categories. And Kathee and her team are making great progress in Apparel and Home and Beauty and you saw the comps that those categories produced in the first quarter. We'll continue to focus on Baby and Kids and accelerate our focus on Wellness. So we believe those categories both in-store but, importantly, as we demonstrated in Q1, online, where a significant portion of our growth in the digital channel was driven by Apparel and Home. So that is a very favorable impact to mix both in-store and, importantly, as we improved and accelerate our online performance.","John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","The other thing I'd add, Matt, more tactically, between Q2 and Q3, that's really last year where you saw us transition from focusing on significant promotions that were primarily hardlines or some of our lower-margin categories focus to the business, back-to-school and then into the holiday season. So as we think about the way Q2 looks versus Q3, that promotional impact was real in Q2 but it was also, we had a significant mix impact because of where we focused those promotions. A little bit less of that as we go into Q3 and Q4 so the delta between last year's margin and this year's margin will change meaningfully. And as Kathee said, we continue to invest in price and quality across all of our brands.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's very helpful. If I could ask one follow up on the e-commerce business. I'd love to get your insights perhaps using REDcard data in terms of how much digital growth do you think at this time point is incremental, i.e., are these new customers or infrequent customers? Thanks.","John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","I think, Matt, I would answer it broadly and say that what we see across all guests is when they become engaged in the digital channel, we see incremental growth in that channel and, importantly, incremental growth in the stores. So their total engagement with us is very incremental, we pickup incremental sales and, importantly, incremental profitability in both channels.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to get into a topic of traffic. I mean I think, traffic was up, second quarter in a row that it's been up. But I was wondering if you could maybe dig a little deeper into that, someone in the grocery space talks about loyal households and it seems to me when you think about Target, you guys want to build frequency and want to build these loyal households. How are you thinking about that? Do you measure that? Is that measure improving? Some of our research suggests some of the early things you guys are doing should be building this number but I want to get your take on it.","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","Yeah, I would say that, Scott, it's pretty early in our transformation to say that we see momentum in that measure as it pertains to food. I will tell you a lot of our growth in transactions is driven by new guests and that's driven more in the signature categories that we have been talking about. Now we believe that we have an opportunity there to drive traffic in food and that's why we're in the midst of putting a lot of tests out in front of our guests both product and presentation to get that business on track and to make sure that we've got a really compelling point of view for our guests and then we will measure that over time to make sure that we're making progress. But today, I would say it's more driven by the signature categories that we've highlighted.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, I mean that's actually where I was going not just food, just on the idea that I think your heavy users are up 25, 30 visits a year. Are you seeing increase in those types of loyal households? It seems to me that might be a key driver here as we go forward to get that frequency up?","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, it's certainly something that we're going to continue to monitor and measure over time. It's still very early for us, but that is a measure that we're clearly looking at. We absolutely want to make sure we're building loyalty. We want to build engagement and traffic. We believe our focus on signature categories brings guests back to Target looking for what's new, what's exciting. And we also want to make sure we complement that with an improved food assortment because we know food is critically important to building engagement and driving overall traffic.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right, perfect. And I had one other one, we obviously are in stores quite a bit and I wanted to get your take, I mean some of the pushback that we hear from investors is on the store level execution, staffing levels, in-stock position, I think people which are maybe just be a little bit better and I was wondering what you think of that and are there initiatives to kind of improve some of those measures and where do you think you are kind of what inning do you think you are in on these areas?","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","Yeah, I think as we would measure that and as we look at the guest feedback that we get, Scott, I would say store execution is very high. Guests are very satisfied with the number of people that we have; their ability to help them. I would say that we have an opportunity on the in-stock side and we've been working on that collectively stores and merchandising as we work through the port situation and getting those back in stock but also just our everyday basics. And it's one of the reasons why our inventory is elevated as we talked about is that we have been making investments, particularly in essentials category to make sure that we can raise our inventory levels appropriate to be in-stock in those categories. So I think that's where we have the most opportunity right now.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, that's reflected in the key initiatives we've been talking about. As we think about changes we're making in experience to elevate Apparel with mannequins to restructure our Home layouts, to begin to make changes in Electronics, we want to make sure we provide the guests with a great in-store experience particularly in those signature categories. But as Kathee just noted, we also need to make sure we're focused on the basics every day, and we need to make sure we've got very high in-stock conditions particularly in those key consumable categories. So for us, execution at store level is critically important. We believe we have the best team in retail and our focus now is on elevating the experience in those key signature areas of our store and ensuring that we're improving the in-stock conditions for basic essentials.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Perfect. Our focus group of women was really pleased, so keep up the great work. Thanks.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott. Appreciate the support.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I think maybe for Kathee, the comment you just made to Scott Mushkin about a lot of the growth in transactions being driven by new guests, can you give us a little more insight to that? Is that a shift in traffic away from frequency and towards new guests? And how significant is that? And is there \u2013 how are you doing? Is it \u2013 are there some new marketing approaches you're taking to get people into the stores to alert them about the signature categories, et cetera? Just some color on that would be great.","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","Yeah, so this is something that we aim to do all the time. And of course, right now, we're comping against some pretty weak numbers post-breach last year, so certainly that's part of it. As we focus on signature categories, I do think that's getting more new guests back into the brands and in a variety of different areas because signature categories cover so much from Beauty to Home, et cetera, to the different style categories. And I think the way that we're doing it is really what Brian was just talking about, presentations that are really compelling, with product that's very inspirational, and inviting them into the store through our marketing which resonates with them and then when they get to the store or online being able to convert them to a purchase. So it's all of those things that I think are moving the needle.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, Kathee, can you just comment more on the sort of propensity to trade-up for the guest? Is it \u2013 is there something changing there or is that just easy comparisons?","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","No, we've seen this coming for a little bit now, third quarter was the start of it, continued into fourth quarter and now, again, in our first quarter. But I think as we're improving quality, as we're stepping up our assortments to be more aspirational, we're seeing the guest really resonate with that product and move, and that's broad across virtually all of our categories. So not just in one segment of our business, but really all of them. So I think it's driven by the guest perhaps having a bit more money in their pocket. I think it's the quality that we've put in, they're recognizing those benefits, and they're wanting to be able to trade-up.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Robby, the one point I'd emphasize so that we're really clear, this isn't an either\/or, it's an and. So we want to make sure we're delivering exceptional value every day on those core essentials and continuing to bring great quality, newness, innovation and value to our guests as they look for these more aspirational items. So it's not a shift in strategy and it's not an either\/or, it's an and, and we've got to make sure that both elements of our strategy include a focus on core essentials and more experiential offerings and when we bring those together, that is the Target brand promise and experience. That's where we bring Expect More. Pay Less to life. So both of those elements are starting to work together and I think you're seeing the guests respond very positively to it.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sounds great. Thanks very much.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just I guess a regional question; in terms of the comp on a regional basis in the first quarter, did you see any differences in your sales trends in states that are potentially a little more dependent on oil and gas? And then I guess the follow up there is, can you also address any negative or potentially positive impact on the organization you see in areas that are increasing the minimum wage?","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start with the regional performance trends, and we didn't see any correlation between what you just referred to, changes in the oil and gas industry, and an influence on our comps. Obviously, like everyone else, and this happens every single year, weather did impact regional performance. We had some challenging days in the Northeast. We faced the same ice storms that others did in the Southeast and in the Texas market. But overall, we saw very consistent comp performance across signature categories. The growth Kathee talked about was strong across the country in Apparel and Beauty and Home. And we've seen very consistent performance trends and responses from our guests across the country.","John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","And to the minimum wage question, no, we haven't seen those types of impacts either.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then just, secondly, it looks like REDcard a nice pickup it looks like on a sequential basis and year-over-year. Can you just talk about where management expectation is now on this particular product and where we think this could potentially go over the next two years or three years here? Thanks.","John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","It's a great question, Robby (sic) [Sean] (46:01), and I think we're sorting through that. We wanted to get through annualizing past all of last year with the breach and the impact there. We're really pleased that we saw 110 basis points of penetration growth. We're seeing new accounts grow again, roughly split equally between credit and debit. I think as we learn a little bit more here as we go through this year, we'll figure out where we want to go. We still are very energized by REDcard as a product offering. I think the opportunity for us is to tie that into a more holistic loyalty offering for our guests. We're testing some of that now out East and you'll see us as the year goes on continue to test that, take those learnings, and apply it more broadly to the loyalty for our guests.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. Best of luck in Q2. Thanks.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks. I had a couple questions. I wanted to make sure I understood the SG&A progression a little bit better. I think, John, in the guidance you said we would delever at 20 bps to 30 bps in the second quarter, which if I take your comp guidance, it suggests it will be up around 5% in dollar terms. Is that \u2013 are we thinking about that right? And what's the real run rate once you get through some of these other timing issues and the breaches on SG&A dollars?","John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, I think, yes, you're right, and all of that increase is really incentive expense, offset by again, some productivity improvements. I think as the year progresses, we'll continue to see improvements in SG&A. As we said throughout the year, as the year progresses, we'll continue to start to see the savings that we committed to, the $2 billion, $500 million of savings this year, about half in COGS, half in SG&A. In SG&A, that'll be offset somewhat by investments in technology. So we should continue getting past the noise. As the year progresses, we'll continue to see leverage, probably similar to what you saw in Q1 as we get into Q3 and Q4.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Okay, got that. And then, Brian, I think in your prepared discussion, you mentioned some disappointment on digital execution, particularly around the Lilly launch. Could you give us a little more detail on what's being done to address those issues in terms of how the website actually works or supply chain? Will you ultimately invest more in fulfillment center capacity? Or just some actual actions to try and address that. Thanks.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Greg, in some ways, you've answered the question for me, and we've been very clear in the fact that we're going to make a $1 billion investment in technology and supply chain to enhance those capabilities, to improve our capabilities, to make sure we're partnering up technology with the ability to provide the product effectively through our supply chain. So the Lilly event, while a sensational event for the brand, and we're really proud that we were able to create a Black Friday type event in the month of April, with hundreds and thousands of our guests lining up waiting for that product, but online we know we had some missteps, and we're doing a deep dive, we're looking at root causes and it's going to provide important learning for us as we get ready for the traffic we expect to generate during the holiday season. But we are very committed to putting our capital behind improving technology capabilities and the supply chain requirements necessary to continue to grow that business at the accelerated rates we're delivering right now.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","When do you think you'll know the things you need to get done for holiday? Is that something you'll know now or is it something to learn in the fall?","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, this afternoon would be nice. But we are actively tearing apart the learning and clearly want to make sure that we have the diagnostics in place as soon as possible, and we're making the necessary adjustments and investments to enhance our overall digital experience. So this afternoon would not be soon enough, and the team has an incredible sense of urgency to ensure that we have the right capabilities so that we're constantly meeting the needs of the guests.","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","And, Greg, I would just add that we're never done with that. So certainly we're learning from the Lilly event and we will put that into play as soon as possible. But as we're growing at the rate that we are and we're introducing new code all the time, we are never done. So this is an ongoing effort probably until the end of time.","Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI","Good luck. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Couple questions. First, just on Made to Matter, just can you give us how many brands have been designated with that? What categories you're seeing being most impactful so far? And what you're doing from a marketing standpoint to support them?","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","Yeah, so Made to Matter's been a fantastic program for us, Peter, as you know, we went from about 15 vendors last year and we increased that to about 30 vendors, 31 vendors this year, and we're seeing about 25% lift in sales. So the guest is really loving the product that we're offering. It's in a variety of categories. There's certainly food products but there's Beauty products, there's OTC, there's Baby. All of them, though, are really driven by simpler, better-for-you product, whether that's in food with cleaner labels and organic or whether that's in Baby where it's cotton and more natural materials, but really great results, and we marketed it most recently in the past month in what we call, the rear seasonal area of our store, where we brought all the products together for the first time and had really fantastic results. There was a marketing campaign that went along with that that really resonated with the guests, and then the in-store presence helped make it easy for them to find when they came to the stores.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Peter, I think the great part of the program is it's just another point of validation, that when we understand what the guest is looking for and we deliver the right curated assortment, they respond really well. And you know that we have over 25 million guests visit our stores every week. We know that 98% of our guests purchase natural or organic products. Thus, we need to make sure we offer them the products and the selection they're looking for. It doesn't mean that conventional products don't play a very important role going forward, but our guest has voted. We understand the guests better than ever before, and Kathee and her team are just doing a sensational job of curating the right assortment and bringing the guests what they're looking for when they shop at Target.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. Do you think is 30 vendors to 31 vendors a good number that you guys think you'll stick with? Do you think you'll add additional vendors to that program over the next 12 months or just maybe rotate out some and keep the number at 30 vendors, 31 vendors?","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","I think that's a pretty good number. We're still evaluating the program, it's just we launched the new vendors this spring so we're still analyzing those results. But to Brian's point, the guests will guide that work. The important part about Made to Matter is that while these brands might be carried elsewhere, we have exclusive products with meaningful innovation within the program within Target and that's what's really resonating with the guests. They recognize those brands are at Target and they love to buy them but they come looking for those new exclusive really innovative products. So I think keeping the number at a reasonable amount so that we're sure that we can drive that right innovation that's very much a partnership with us and these suppliers. So I think we're in the hunt with the right number.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. We've definitely seen it in the stores as well. Quick one just on the food repositioning. In terms of the cadence this year in terms of testing things, what should we be looking at? Is there going to be space allocation changes? Is it going to be just new brands? And once you do decide what you're going to do, is it going to be an early 2016 kind of rollout, something that could impact a lot of that year? Or is it something that would happen, kind of, later in 2016? Thank you.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Peter, Kathee and I have been talking about this for several months now. We're using 2015 to test and learn. Kathee has talked about key categories within food that we really think Target should stand for, and we're looking very closely at how we evolve assortment and how we merchandise those categories going forward. But this is not about how fast we make the changes. We want to make sure we really have a chance to test, learn, get the feedback from the guest, iterate, so that as we move into 2016 and beyond, we move forward with confidence. And with the confidence that the guest has guided us through the changes we're going to make. So we're clearly focused on it, the team is making very good progress, but we're in that test and learn and validate environment right now, and you should expect to see much more unfold as we get into 2016.","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","The thing that I would add is as we're going to the testing, as Brian mentioned, we're testing many different things, whether that's assortment changes that we're making, presentation changes that we're making, supply chain changes, part of our testing is to try to isolate those tests so that we can get a good read. So there's not going to be one place that you can go look at what is the new food innovation look like. We've got it all over the place. And the other thing that I would add is you know that we've just hired Anne Dament to run the Senior Vice President of Grocery, and we're very excited about that. She's been onboard now for about a month, and brings us 19 years of experience in grocery and CPG.","So she's certainly learning and onboarding into Target and bringing a wealth of knowledge from grocery which will also impact what we put forth in terms of tests for the rest of the year. But I think you can look to 2016 as we learn and prove out what's working with the guests, what's resonating, we will start rolling those in 2016 but don't expect the big bang on January 1. To Brian's point, this is really about getting it right and delighting the guests, not moving fast.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Understood. Thanks, Kathee. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple questions. On the gross margin line, did shipping expense at all impact you with the move to $25? And how many REDcard holders are utilizing their cards for free shipping? How do we think about that as e-commerce continues to grow?","John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","So certainly shipping expense went up when we moved to $25 but I would tell you not a material impact on the quarter. And net-net, as we've said, as that brings more guests online, they shop our store, and so a net positive as far as we're concerned across the lifetime value of those guests. I don't have the actual number of REDcard holders that use free shipping on the site, but I can tell you the penetration of free shipping due to REDcard on the site is very, very high. In general, we have a very high percentage of our shipping that goes out free from the site.","We talked about this last year when we shipped to free \u2013 switched to free shipping during the holiday season and I think that is why, going back to what Brian said, the supply chain investments we make are incredibly important for our guests because they provide speed to market from their perspective but they're incredibly important for us because they improve the economics of our online business meaningfully.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. And then the second question I have is there's a lot of license initiatives that are coming over the next several quarters. When you think about the year-over-year impact on the business overall, are those gross margin accretive in terms of what they're trying to do? Would they be lower margin? And just how do we think about that as it relates to the mix and the gross margin overall?","Kathryn A. Tesija - Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","A lot of that depends on the categories. I think the good part about licenses at Target is that our guests respond to them very broadly, so it isn't just a toy or a video game. For us, there's Apparel involved, there's back-to-school products like backpacks and notebooks. So it's a pretty \u2013 they have a pretty healthy margin mix just given the breadth of category, and most of them fall into our signature categories. So we're very excited about the lineup of licenses and the fact that they start this summer and really go all fall.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","John R. Hulbert - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher M. Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. So two quick ones. You originally guided the first quarter gross margin up 40 to 50, so I was curious what came in better versus your expectations? Was it mix or was it the level of promotions, lapping the level of promotions year-over-year? And then I have a follow up.","John J. Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","It was mix is what came in better, and I think we see that in two ways. First of all, there's just the mix of selling those products and then when we see strength in Home and Apparel, of course, our sell-throughs go up, and so we have less markdowns. And so the positive benefits of mix go on and on.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd only add, Christopher, that again, we saw that mix benefit both in-store and online. So the combination of those two channels working together clearly impacts and improves gross margin rate.","Christopher M. Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And then so the outlook \u2013 and you mentioned this going forward, the outlook in the second quarter is predicated on recapturing both of those and then going on further in the year. It's really expectation that the signature categories out-comp more the essential side?","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That is certainly core to our strategy as we go forward. And I think what you saw, what we saw in Q1, very solid performance. Kathee and her team did a terrific job of curating the right products, particularly in those signature categories for our guests. Despite some of the port challenges, our supply chain teams did an outstanding job of making sure we had inventory in place for the guests.","I was very pleased with our marketing program, and if you haven't seen the Target style campaign or some of the things we just did for Avengers, its spectacular advertising and the guests are responding to it. And our store teams just did a phenomenal job throughout the quarter despite port challenges and weather challenges of providing the guests with a good experience and it added up to really solid results in Q1. So we hope that continues. We're confident it's going to continue throughout the year, but we feel good about the progress, we know we've got a lot of work in front of us, but that combination of strong in-store and online growth in the first quarter gives us a lot of confidence that we're heading in the right direction.","Brian C. Cornell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, operator, that concludes our call today. I thank everybody for their participation, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"20330":["Target (NYSE:TGT) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May 16, 2012 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregg W.

Welcome to the Target Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 16, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Good morning, and welcome to our 2012 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our first quarter results and strategic priorities for the year. Then Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. And finally, John will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for second quarter and full year 2012. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have.","Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of our -- to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","We're very pleased with Target's first quarter financial performance. Adjusted earnings per share, a measure reflecting the performance of our U.S. businesses, increased 11.5% from a year ago as outstanding performance in our U.S. Retail segment more than offset a year-over-year decline in credit card segment profitability. GAAP earnings per share, which includes the impact of our Canadian segment investments and unique tax items, increased 5% over first quarter 2011.","In the U.S. Retail segment, our comparable store sales increase of 5.3% is the largest we've experienced since the third quarter of 2005 and more than 1 percentage point stronger than we expected going into the quarter. As we noted in our monthly sales releases, unusually warm weather, combined with an earlier Easter, drove stronger-than-expected traffic and sales in February and March. Once guests were in our stores, they responded quite positively to our spring merchandise assortments. Sales trends accelerated across-the-board but were particularly strong in Apparel due to the seasonal sensitivity to that -- of that category.","We maintained a very healthy operating margin in our U.S. Retail segment as gross margin investments in our store remodel and 5% Rewards growth strategies were more than offset by underlying strength in category gross margins, combined with meaningful expense leverage. As we've indicated before, expense discipline has played a key role in Target's financial success as we've navigated the great recession and ongoing recovery. We are committed to maintaining that discipline, even when the economy and the consumer recover more fully.","Our credit card portfolio continues to generate outstanding profitability, in addition to the value it creates by serving as the platform for our 5% Rewards program. The credit card team has done a terrific job managing this portfolio, which has emerged from the recession lean and healthier than ever.","5% Rewards continues to exceed our expectations. Penetration of sales on our credit and debit cards continues to grow substantially, with households shopping and spending more when they add one of these cards to their wallet. And in Kansas City, which launched this program a year earlier than the rest of the country, we continue to see growth without any sign of a slowdown, even though the program is well into its third year in that market. This loyalty program drives a meaningful increase in guest engagement, regardless of the starting point. In other words, all guests, from our least engaged to our most valuable guests, become much more valuable when they decide to sign up for this program.","I want to thank everyone on the Target team around the world, more than 365,000 strong, for driving superior performance we're reporting today. I'm inspired by your accomplishments and your passionate commitment to our guests and the Target brand.","We continue to invest thoughtfully in our stores, adding locations when we find opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria. In addition, we're transforming our existing store base to reflect our latest thinking in terms of layout, presentation and overall store experience. In the first quarter, we opened 3 new stores, adding 1 location net of closures for rebuild and relocation. We also completed more than 100 remodels, resulting in nearly 1,000 general merchandise stores that we've either opened or remodeled in the last 4 years. This means that even though we've reduced new store growth in response to the recession and resulting slowdown in commercial development, our store base is much fresher than before the recession began. Guests in these stores respond to the appealing environment by spending more at Target as we capture more of their shopping trips. While the most visible change to these stores is the addition of a broader food assortment, including an edited assortment of perishable items, guests also respond to enhanced navigation, compelling visual elements and our latest thinking in Beauty, Shoes, Home, Apparel and baby.","As we look ahead to the remainder of 2012, we remain confident in our strategy and operational plan but cautious about the macro environment. We believe the current economic recovery will continue to be slow and uneven. As a result, we believe it's prudent to plan our business accordingly, knowing that we can quickly respond, as we did in the first quarter, when an unexpected surge in traffic and sales occurs.","Outside of the U.S., we're pleased with our progress in preparation for the launch of Canadian Target stores in spring 2013. We are actively building our talented team in Canada, and we're on track in the development of the IT and distribution infrastructures that will service those stores. In the second quarter, Zellers will begin vacating the first set of locations that we expect to open our Target stores next year, allowing us time to completely renovate these sites to accommodate our unique merchandise assortments and operating model. As a reminder, we expect to open 125 to 135 Target stores in Canada by 2014 as a result of our real estate transaction with Zellers.","We also continue to devote meaningful resources to our online capabilities and multichannel efforts. In the near term, we're focused on strengthening our current web platform to enhance the guest experience. Over time, our vision is to create a unique seamless integration of our stores, online mobile platforms and social media, providing our guests the same great experience regardless of the channel they choose.","We continue to invest capital and resources in strategies that drive both our near-term and long-term performance. In merchandising, we're committed to continuous innovation, finding new ways to surprise and delight our guests. We've been pleased with the initial results from the first flight of The Shops at Target, our most recent effort to deliver great design and differentiated merchandise at prices our guests can afford.","We're anticipating the opening of our first 3 CityTarget stores in July, with locations in LA, Chicago and Seattle. These stores will provide the Target experience to guests in dense urban neighborhoods that can't accommodate our larger formats. These stores will offer a curated assortment across all of our merchandise categories designed to serve the unique wants and needs of guests in these markets.","In addition, we're continuing to invest in technology [indiscernible] spaces welcoming and easy-to-shop and will leverage our learnings across the chain. We plan to open another 2 CityTarget stores in October and will study results in these 5 pilot locations to inform future store growth and merchandising decisions.","We'll continue to develop and implement strategies like our 5% Rewards, REDcard Free Shipping and Pharmacy Rewards programs that increase loyalty and drive incremental sales by offering our guests convenience and additional savings beyond our everyday low prices. We'll invest in our remodel program, bringing the total number of stores with our expanded food assortment and merchandise reinvestments to more than 1,100 across the country. This number represents about 75% of the general merchandise stores in the chain and nearly all of the eligible stores in major markets.","And we remain committed to selling our credit card receivables portfolio. Our goal is to establish a long-term relationship with the right partner on the right terms, removing the receivable assets from our balance sheet. The right transaction will allow us to pursue our strategic objectives while sharing in the outstanding profitability we believe this portfolio will continue to generate over time.","Many of you tell me that our vision for Target's future and the strategic initiatives to support that vision are extremely ambitious. I agree. But the experience and commitment of our talented team and our track record of success give me confidence in our continued ability to innovate, take thoughtful risks and reinvent ourselves in an environment that's changing more rapidly than ever. What remains constant is our focus on our guests and our goal to serve them better, saving them time and money in a way that deepens their relationship with Target. We believe that this disciplined focus on our guests will lead us to develop and implement winning strategies for the future, just like we benefit today from strategies we began to develop years ago.","Finally, before I turn it over to Kathy, I want to take a moment to comment on the newest addition to our executive team, Chief Marketing Officer Jeff Jones. As you know, we conducted a lengthy and exhausted search to fill this key position, and I couldn't be happier that Jeff has joined our team. He has extensive experience and a proven record of success developing teams and building brands across traditional, digital and social media spaces. I'm confident that Jeff will build on Target's long-term success in marketing. And I'm excited to work with him to elevate our iconic brand to an even higher level.","Now Kathy will provide more detail on first quarter results, share recent guests insights and outline initiatives for the second quarter and beyond. Kathy?","Kathryn A. Tesija","Thanks, Gregg.","Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise. Our low prices, great store experience and broad assortment in Food and Household Essentials drive traffic regardless of the economic environment. In addition, when guests feel comfortable splurging on more discretionary items, we deliver an unbeatable combination of fashion, design and value on a unique assortment of items across Apparel, Home and Hardlines.","In the first quarter, both the pace and mix of our sales exceeded our expectations. Early warm weather and appealing spring fashions drove higher-than-expected traffic and sales, particularly in our seasonally sensitive categories. As a result, first quarter comparable store sales in Apparel grew slightly faster than the company average, the best quarterly performance in that category since 2006.","Outside apparel, sales in frequency categories like Food, Healthcare and Beauty continue to grow consistently and rapidly as guests respond to Target's unique combination of convenience and value, especially in our remodeled stores.","In Hardlines and Home, first quarter results were strongest in gifting and seasonal categories like lawn and patio, Housewares, Toys and Sporting Goods.","On our website and mobile platforms, first quarter sales increased but at a slower rate than in our stores. As Gregg described, our focus in the near term is to strengthen the website experience. And while we continue to make meaningful progress, we still have more to do. Traffic to the site remains strong, and conversion and guest satisfaction scores continue to improve. We will continue to implement improvements to create the appropriate foundation for our longer-term multichannel efforts.","Consumer research provides insight into the environment that created stronger-than-expected first quarter sales while reinforcing our cautious outlook going forward. In the first quarter, research indicated that consumers were feeling a bit more confident in their financial situations, making them somewhat more comfortable spending across all categories. However, the consumer optimism about the future reached a peak in February and began to decline in March and April. In addition, the percent of consumers planning to cut near-term spending increased in April, suggesting the possibility of shorter -- of softer growth in the near term. On the positive side, recent declines in gas prices may lead to improvements in sentiment and stronger household budgets.","Against this backdrop of uncertainty, we're planning our inventory appropriately for the second quarter and later in the year. We're committed to achieving our sales plan and maintaining solid in-stock levels while reserving flexibility to adjust to short-term changes in traffic and sales. As we demonstrated this quarter, our base inventory can support meaningful upside to our near-term sales plan.","For the second quarter and beyond, we've designed merchandising and marketing programs to surprise and inspire our guests and support both sides of our Expect More. Pay Less. brand promise. This year, we want to show our guests that we're the one-stop shop for summer fun. We'll highlight an assortment of bright colors and fun patterns splashed across tabletop items, backyard essentials, picnic supplies and beach basics designed to make summer entertaining, fun, affordable and effortless. And we've created in-store marketing elements, visuals of oversized sunglasses or flip-flops hanging from the ceiling, that will be impossible to miss.","For more than a decade, Target's design partnerships have played a key role in differentiating our stores and merchandise assortments, offering our guests something they can't find anywhere else and making the previously inaccessible accessible for all. The Shops at Target is the latest innovation in our partnership strategy. Rather than working with a usual [ph] designer, this program highlights items from small, distinctive specialty stores, hidden gems which up until now have only been accessible to those lucky enough to live nearby. Last week, we launched the first flight of The Shops at Target, providing guests across the country the opportunity to see what makes these shops so special, and the response has been quite favorable. With surprising finds across a variety of departments, the shops offer unique products in Beauty, Apparel, pets, Home and Candy. Our second flight of the shops will set in early September with products in men's apparel, women's apparel and Home.","Beyond this new strategy, we continue to work with designers and brands to create Target exclusive collections. With the help of Todd Oldham, Target is letting kids be kids with our new and exclusive collection, Kid Made Modern. This collection of art supplies and activity kits gives kids and parents fun yet affordable creative design tools to inspire through art. Look for Kid Made Modern in stores and online next week.","In music, we've partnered with Grammy winner Norah Jones to bring guests a deluxe edition of her new album, Little Broken Hearts. The Target deluxe edition, which features 3 bonus tracks, is available now. We've also partnered with 19-time Grammy award-winning music producer Emilio Estefan, who will work with Target to curate a special selection of his favorite music, movies and books, entitled Emilio Estefan's Picks. The selections will be featured online and in the entertainment department of select Target stores beginning June 6. Additionally, Estefan will leverage his strong relationships and pulse on the industry to help develop Target-exclusive partnerships with Latin music artists.","In swimwear, we continue to build on our industry-leading market share position by growing in our owned and exclusive brands. This spring, we're very pleased with early results from the rollout of ASSETS by the makers of SPANX, featuring one-piece suits and fashion tankinis. We've also seen strong increases in young contemporary swimwear with signature print tankinis from Converse. And in Mossimo Black, we've seen -- we have created a fashion solid mix-and-match destination.","In July, we'll roll out a new series of fits in men's apparel in both Merona and Mossimo to better match our guests' more modern tastes. We're also reorganizing the floor pad by types of apparel rather than brand to make it easier for our guests to find what they're looking for.","Looking beyond the second quarter, we're very excited about our recently announced plans to rebrand our Target Home brand as Threshold, beginning this fall. Target Home is already our largest owned brand, but we saw an opportunity to better clarify its positioning and point of view, so we undertook the biggest rebranding effort in our history. Everything was on the table in this effort: product, quality, packaging and positioning within our brand portfolio. We engaged in a similar effort to redefine our Room Essentials brand a couple of years ago, and we've been very pleased with the results. We believe this is an opportune time to rebrand Target Home as the economy continues to improve and more guests are beginning to feel comfortable trading up from good to better brands.","We'll debut Threshold with an assortment of entertaining essentials, accents and decorative accessories and plan to extend the brand across our entire home assortment in 2013. We'll have more information to share on this brand launch in future conference calls.","I feel very good about the health of our business, our plans going forward and the ability of our team to execute on those plans. Across our business, we're committed to achieving the appropriate balance between managing risk and seizing opportunity, between wants and needs and ultimately Expect More. Pay Less. Instead of choosing only one or the other, we've proven successful over time by choosing both.","Now John will share his insights on our first quarter performance and outlook going forward. John?","John J. Mulligan","Thanks, Kathy. This morning, I'll provide more detail on the drivers of our first quarter financial performance, and I'll wrap up by providing our current outlook for the second quarter and our 2012 fiscal year.","As you know, last year, we began reporting adjusted earnings per share because it allows all of us to measure the performance of our U.S. businesses, excluding the impact of our Canadian segment investments and unique or onetime items. In the first quarter, adjusted EPS grew 11.5% from $0.99 in 2011 to $1.11 this year. This performance was better than we forecasted going into the quarter and just above the updated range we provided on our March sales release. Performance in both our U.S. segments was outstanding and ahead of our plan for the quarter.","On a GAAP basis, we earned $1.04 per share, $0.07 lower than adjusted EPS, reflecting Canadian segment expenses worth $0.08 a share, offset by a $0.01 benefit from the favorable resolution of income tax matters.","Our first quarter comparable store sales increase of 5.3% was well above our planned increase of about 4%. These unexpectedly strong sales drove outstanding profitability when compared with both our plan and last year. As Kathy mentioned, consumer sentiment turned somewhat more positive early in the quarter, and we certainly experienced the traffic and sales impact of early warm weather combined with earlier Easter timing.","On our sales, we earned a very healthy EBITDA margin rate of 10.3%, favorable to last year and our plan. This performance reflected a modest decline in our gross margin rate as the impact of our remodel program and 5% Rewards was partially offset by favorable sales mix unrelated to our remodel program, combined with gross margin rate improvements within categories.","On the SG&A expense line, we gained leverage of about 0.5 percentage point, driven by continued productivity improvement in our stores and disciplined expense control across the company. As expected, depreciation and amortization expenses were essentially flat to last year, providing an additional benefit to our retail EBIT margin rate.","As Gregg mentioned, our 5% Rewards program is exceeding our expectations in terms of penetration and incremental sales. In the first quarter, percent of sales on our credit and debit cards grew 4 full percentage points over last year to 11.6%. Notably, most of this incremental penetration is coming from our debit card, which many of our guests are choosing because they don't want another credit card in their wallet. Either choice is fine with us because, regardless of whether they choose our debit or credit card, guests on average increase their spending with us more than 50% once they get the card.","The Kansas City market, where we implemented this program a year ahead of the rest of the country, has so far proven to be an incredibly accurate roadmap for our national rollout in every aspect. And in that market, we continue to see year-over-year penetration increases of more than 3 percentage points, giving us a high degree of confidence that this program will continue to contribute to our sales growth well into the future.","In our U.S. Credit Card segment, we continue to earn an outstanding yield on a portfolio that is shrinking as planned. Yield for the quarter was 9.1% above LIBOR or $137 million, down from $209 million a year ago. This year-over-year decline was the result of cycling a very large reserve reduction in first quarter 2011, along with the impact of a smaller asset base.","During the quarter, we renegotiated the private securitization conduit, which continues to fund a portion of the credit card portfolio, increasing its size by $500 million to $1.5 billion and extending its maturity until midyear 2013. We have the right to retire this financing early at par, flexibility that will be beneficial as we continue to pursue our goal of a credit card receivable sale.","As expected, our Canadian segment recorded first quarter SG&A expense of $34 million, up from $20 million in the prior quarter, as we continue to build our Canadian team and record expenses related to IT investments. In addition, we recorded $21 million in depreciation and amortization within the segment and $20 million of interest expense on capitalized Canadian leases outside the segment, consistent with fourth quarter results.","Even while we continue to invest in our U.S. and Canadian segments, we have the capacity within our debt ratings to return a meaningful amount of cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we invested about $600 million to retire approximately 10.5 million shares, fitting a very strong start on our annual plan. In addition, we paid dividends of just over $200 million, meaning we returned well over 100% of our first quarter net earnings to shareholders.","Now let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year. Even though we experienced upside in the first quarter, our view of sales for the remainder of the year remains largely the same as before, given the current environment. For the second quarter, that means we're planning comparable store sales increase of around 3%. And for the year, we believe our prior guidance of 3% or a little more remains appropriate, and we're happy to have a very strong start on that plan through one quarter.","For what it's worth, so far in May, our sales have been running essentially on-plan and consistent with our prior guidance of a low- to mid-single-digit increase. And we remain comfortable with our outlook for the quarter and the year.","We continue to expect U.S. Retail segment EBITDA margins in line with last year's performance, with continued modest gross margin rate declines generally offset by leverage on SG&A expenses. Of course, year-over-year comparisons on these metrics in any one quarter will likely exhibit more noise than we'll experience for the year in total. As of today, we expect our Q2 EBITDA margin rate will be in line with last year's performance.","In the U.S. Credit Card segment, we expect continued declines in the asset base, although the rate of decline will likely moderate throughout the year. We expect portfolio yield to remain quite healthy, but we'll continue to experience year-over-year declines in spread to LIBOR as we cycle large reserve reductions in last year's second and third quarters. On a rate basis, we continue to expect the portfolio to earn a spread to LIBOR of 700 basis points or more for the year.","Our plans for the Canadian segment remain right on track, and we look forward to opening our first Canadian Target stores in a little less than a year. This year, SG&A expenses in this segment will continue to build as we continue adding to the Canadian team and we begin to incur dead rent during the 6- and 9-month period required to convert former Zellers sites into brand-new Target stores.","So putting this all together. We expect to earn second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.04 to $1.14 and GAAP EPS of $0.94 to $1.04, with the $0.10 difference in those ranges reflecting our forecast of expenses related to our Canadian segment. For the full year, we've raised our outlook by $0.05 and expect adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.80 and GAAP EPS of $4.10 to $4.30. We continue to forecast a $0.50 difference between those ranges, reflecting our outlook for full year expenses related to our Canadian segment.","Altogether, this performance in 2012 will keep us right on track to achieve our long-range plan for $100 billion or more in sales and $8 or more in earnings per share by 2017.","Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","We're very pleased with our first quarter 2012 financial performance, confident in our strategy, and we're planning our business appropriately for the second quarter and beyond.","That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now Kathy, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","[indiscernible] rewards card, just shy of 12% penetration. It sounds like Kansas City is running 15%, and you\u2019re continuing to see pretty steady increases there. So a couple of questions. Firstly, where do you think the ultimate penetration goes? Would you expect the total company penetration to be up to the 15% range this year, given Kansas City? And is Kansas City still generating the 50%-plus lift of incremental spend, which would suggest the comp lift to the total business is running at about 150 basis points?","John J. Mulligan","So first on penetration. Ultimately, where do we expect penetration to go this year? I think you're probably in the right range for the company by Q4, not on average for the year, obviously, but probably in November and then obviously in December, it comes down a little bit with the sales surge. But in November, that's probably about the right range. And in Kansas City, you're right. We continue to see fantastic performance, penetration growing 300 basis points a year. And the lift there, just like it is in the rest of the country, continues to be in excess of 50% for both credit and the debit product. The only comment I'd make is -- other comment I'd make is the lift in penetration now, driven about 2:1 by debit rather than credit, and that's a reversal from what we saw about a year ago at this time.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Yes, I would just add that over the long term we really don't know -- we're -- how high, high is. We continue to be excited about the performance in Kansas City in the chain, and we believe that there is still a long runway with the growth of this penetration over time. We're going to continue to invest in it. And clearly, guests, really, the ones that get it, love it. And our challenge is continue to get more guests to understand the immediate and powerful benefits that both of these cards provide for them.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up for Kathy. I know you do a pretty thorough job looking at pricing on a regular basis. Any comments on what you're seeing in the environment, especially in the more consumables area?","Kathryn A. Tesija","I would say that the environment's pretty rational right now. It's always very competitive. And as we head into the summer and getting closer to Back-to-School, I'm sure that, that will heat up, as it does every year. But I would say right now it's pretty rational.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions, first on the inventory position. Obviously, you had better sales in Q1. I'm assuming maybe that's a little bit why the inventory's down slightly year-over-year. I just wanted to get your thoughts on your ability to flex in Q2. Is there any limiting factors based on your inventory position today? And then secondly, if you could share any web metrics with us that outline some of the progress you've made.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","I'll take the first one on the inventory. Our inventory remains in great shape. We have a large base inventory that we can sell into, so we don't believe there's any real -- or any meaningful limitations in our ability to perform in second quarter or even exceed the sales plan that we've laid out for you today.","Kathryn A. Tesija","And the second one, on web metrics. We're very focused on our overall site performance, watching speed on all parts of the site, all pages, as well as our ability to improve search and order fulfillment. And so I'll tell you we've -- we're investing meaningful resources in our multichannel efforts. We're very committed to making improvements. We have seen those metrics improve meaningfully so far this spring. We still have a lot of releases yet to come this spring and summer, and we think that, that will continue to help these metrics improve. So a big focus for us, and you'll see us continue to talk about it as we go throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of the SG&A performance in the quarter, can you just provide a little bit more color in terms of the improvement there on the retail side?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, Deb. I think, first of all, expense has been, like Gregg mentioned, a big part of our performance over the past several years and again this quarter, led by the stores, significant productivity increases in the stores as they continue to deliver great guest experience. I think, on top of that, we saw great expense performance really across the entire company, very disciplined expense growth in all aspects of our business. And the final comment I'd make is, when we see sales surge like this, our variable expenses grow a little bit, don't ramp up as quickly as we see sales ramp up, so we get some benefit from that. You see that on the downside too when sales decelerate quickly. It takes us a little while to get our variable expenses back in line. But overall, really great expense control in the quarter.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then can you talk about the improvement in mix and also what you're seeing with regards to private label?","Kathryn A. Tesija","Well, certainly, our Apparel sales this spring helped our mix quite a bit, but I would say owned brands overall have been strong, really, across-the-board. Our consumables and commodity categories, as you know, continue to be very strong. All of our Apparel owned brands have been performing quite well. And in Home, we've seen good results in Room Essentials, which we've talked about before, but also Smith & Hawken and some of our better brands.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","We now have 10 owned brands or signature national brands that are -- that do over $1 billion in retail. We continue to invest in our owned brands. We treat them as national brands. We position them as such. And they're a key part of our strategy. So we're -- you're going to see us continue to focus on these very important parts of our merchandising strategy, including, as Kathy mentioned, the relabeling or the rebranding of our Home brand into Threshold later this fall and as we transition into spring and summer of 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just, John, I was wondering if we could dig into the gross profit margin line a little bit more, if you could kind of put into buckets the mix impact, the impact from 5%, the rate benefits. And then I guess kind of looking ahead, what should we think about for the balance of the year?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, I think, in Q1, I would tell you that more than all of the rate declines, as we said in the comments, came from 5% Rewards and PFresh. And we saw a significant improvement in mix, as Kathy just spoke about, and a little bit of rate good news across all the categories rounded out the balance of that. I think, as we look forward, we would expect to see similar declines driven by both 5% Rewards and PFresh through Q2, Q3 and the year and perhaps a little bit of good news across the categories. We don't plan for mix improvement. That was kind of a bonus this quarter with the good apparel mix. But we'll see some rate improvement across the categories as we go forward, as well.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then after multiple quarters here of sub-1% traffic, you guys enjoyed a nice uptick here in the first quarter. Why do you think it got better for you guys? And do you think it's sustainable?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, as we said in the -- the strong early weather was certainly a portion, but overall, I would just tell you that Target's on its game. We're delivering great value, great overall experience. Our merchandising content is fantastic, it's colorful and bright season. Our stores are delivering great service. We're just doing a lot of things very well in our stores right now, and I think the benefit of that is continued market share gains across all categories and guests that really love the shopping experience at Target. And that's really what we delivered in the first quarter, and that's why I think the traffic levels were up in that 2% range.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one last one for John. Just the credit metrics, the monthly ones that you guys report, delinquencies have come in much better here over the past few months. Can you hold our hand a little bit on how we should model the allowance line and bad debt as we cruise through the rest of the year?","John J. Mulligan","Sure. I think, on delinquencies, a lot of what you saw here in Q1 was really seasonal. I think that's been hard to deduce over the past several years as we kind of climbed up and then have come down. But a lot of that improvement is seasonal. Having said that, it was still a little bit better than we would've expected going into the year. I think our expectations are we'll continue to see year-over-year improvement in delinquencies as we go forward here through Q2 and then probably leveling off. Q2 last year was when we really started coming back. The delinquencies in our bad debt expense versus write-offs started to level off. So you'll see that level off getting into Q3 and Q4. I think, on the reserve, right now, we're at about 6.6% of assets, and that's about the range, 6.5%, that we'd intend to stay at for the year. I think if you look at our -- the reserve release in Q1, $35 million, 80% of that was really tied to volume of the asset base coming down, the last 20%, the last $7 million or $8 million, tied to delinquencies. So a little bit of good room in reserve if delinquencies continue, but I don't think anything significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions. First on the comp. The plan you guys have, the 3%, how much of that shift from the 5.3% we just did down to 3% would you say would be traffic versus ticket? And specifically in ticket, that ASP per unit, that actually had a nice pick-up to 2.6%.","John J. Mulligan","Greg, that's hard to say. We don't forecast at that level of specificity, traffic versus ticket. What I would tell you -- as you know, if you step back and look at what we talked about at the beginning of the year, we said -- or 90 days ago, we said 3% or a little bit more and 4% for the quarter. Obviously, Q1 was faster than that, but given that we had a 4% in Q1, the other 3 quarters were bound to be lower, given what our thought was on the year. And that's really what you see here. So I think the 3% for our quarter is -- for Q2 is right on our thinking when we went into the year.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So maybe asked a different way, that 2.6% year-over-year, we were seeing Food or Home CPI decelerate, is it your working assumption that, that will -- that could start to take that number, the 2.6%, that, that would also slow into the second quarter? It wouldn't just be traffic, in other words, but...","John J. Mulligan","Yes, it's possible, but that would be a relatively small impact relative to what's -- all the other variables that are driving our sales at any given time.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second is on CapEx. Can you just update us on what the budget is for this year and sort of where that peaks as we're doing Canada and when it comes down over the next couple of years?","John J. Mulligan","Yes. I think -- sure. This year, we're -- we remain at about $3.3 billion in total: $2.5 billion in the U.S. and $800 million in Canada. We haven't released guidance going out. But I would tell you, for the U.S., that 2.5% range could be plus or minus. Something in between $2 billion and $3 billion is the right range for us to think about in the U.S. Canada, we expect to peak next year, probably somewhere over $1 billion as we get through all the remodel cycles, just given the number of stores we're doing. And we\u2019ve said $10 million to $11 million per store, so somewhere over $1 billion next year, and then Canada easing back significantly post that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Carroll with UBS.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One quick question -- or actually, 2 -- in 2 parts going to REDcard. I was wondering, coming out of Q4, and obviously, there's a little bit more noise around the REDcard contribution during Q4 and the holidays, but I think there've been a comment where debit had been lagging a little bit in terms of the initial lift versus what you -- had been seen from credit. So that 50% blended number that you're talking about now, is there any sort of -- I guess, how big is the divergence between those? Or has it kind of normalized where the 2 have come back together during Q1?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, I think what we're seeing now -- well, first, I -- debit has started to grow significantly faster. And as that has happened, we've seen both debit and credit are within noise of each other, above 50% lifts. So both of them above 50%, and the average is right around there as well.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, now that we have a little bit more data on there, I mean, how does that customer season? And I mean, if the -- is that the year one lift where you're seeing that 50% for new customers? And I mean, if so, when you start looking at year 2, I mean, do they continue to outperform the broader corporate average?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, we see that year one lift increase in total spend, and then they stay at that level of purchasing with us. They stay a very, very engaged guest. And I think that's kind of the point here, is we take a guest, and as Gregg mentioned, regardless of where they were prior to getting a REDcard, we get a sales lift on average of 50%, and they become just a much, much more engaged guest, more trips. And all of that remains in year 2. Obviously, we're just starting to get in here in year 3, but we see similar behavior there as well.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Yes, well, that's one of the things we think is really exciting about the credit and debit products, is the fact that, whether you're a convenience user, you're least engaged, you're visiting us only seasonally or you're one of our VIPs, this card is meaningful -- these cards are meaningful for you, and you're moving up the value chain. So people that are coming very often but spending very little, they love this card. Our best guests, they love these cards -- these products too. So it's exciting that virtually all of our guest demographics understand and realize the power and the value and the benefits of our credit and debit REDcard Rewards program and visit us more often and spend more on the card. So it's really sticky, and it's got -- it's a great loyalty program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A question for Kathy. On your survey where you found that consumers kind of peaked on their confidence in February, and then we saw that drop off into March and April, what factors were they citing? Maybe give us some insights on where the consumer's head is right now.","Kathryn A. Tesija","I think the point is just that their confidence peaked in February, but as they were looking forward, and I'm -- gas prices are a part of that and just their budget overall. They were getting a bit more cautious, which is why I said, as we look forward, we are remaining liquid and making sure that our inventories stay in line so that we can adjust, whether that confidence goes back up, like it did in the first quarter. And you can see that even on our base inventory, we can outsell our sales performance by a considerable amount. But if it doesn't and their confidence goes down, we'll be able to keep our inventories in-line and maintain our profitability. So I think it's a combination of things that are just happening in the marketplace that make them more or less nervous at any given point in time.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Have you looked back in time? Did you find that those indexes are more tied to unemployment trends? Or is it just gas prices and more near-term jitters?","Kathryn A. Tesija","I think it's all of those things combined, but certainly, the ones that take money out of their wallet today have a meaningful impact to what they're able to spend on other products. So gas would be one of those.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And for John, on the credit card segment, first quarter was probably your toughest compare in terms of lapping the largest reserve release. Should we expect that decline in the credit card EBIT to kind of decelerate, moving forward?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, I think that's right, although we still have a very large reserve release of $85 million last year in Q2 and somewhere around $50 million -- $40 million to $50 million, in Q3, so still very large things to annualize against. But your trend is right. The year-over-year performance will improve as we go through the year.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, thank you, and we'll be watching for Canada.","John J. Mulligan","Great.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Sounds good. And we're excited.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there a way to think about the weather pull-forward? It's a great debate out there amongst investors. Is it something that is isolated to an April time frame? Or do you think that some of that happens in May as well?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, nobody really knows. I think we're all sitting around, trying to figure out how much business was pulled forward, how many weeks did that go post Easter and when we're going to see a more normalized time frame. And I think we're basically there now. I think there's -- I think there were a couple of weeks maybe that bled into May a little bit. But right now, I think that it's safe to assume that the -- that any weather-related factors are essentially behind us.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then as you think about x that weather shift, do you think you had run, let's say, a 4-ish type comp x the holiday season? Do you think that shifted higher as a result of some of the improvement in macro and merchandising perhaps disruption that you're seeing in some of your competitors?","John J. Mulligan","Perhaps. We ran a little bit stronger than that early in the quarter. It's really hard to say. It's hard to parse those things apart. I think, like I said, when we go back to what we were thinking 90 days ago, we thought we'd run a 4. We ran a 5, so clearly, business was a bit better in Q1. But right now, we're operating about where we thought we'd be when we talked to you guys 90 days ago.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question on the timing of the buyback and the flow-through. You bought back a lot of stock this quarter. Was it purchased late in the quarter, and that's why it didn't show up? And was any of it offset by share dilution?","John J. Mulligan","We don't talk much about the timing within the quarter, Chris. I think, anytime we're buying within a quarter, it's not going to have a lot of impact on that quarter just because of the nature of how we calculate average shares in that quarter. And I think our dilution -- any share dilution that occurred would be normal course. We didn't see anything outside what normally happens every year, every quarter as we go along.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to follow up on what Chris was asking a little bit there. The -- if I'm right, the fiscal '12 guidance was increased about $0.05 on the earnings front, and I think, versus your initial plan, you beat by more like $0.10, $0.11 if you use the midpoint. So it doesn't sound like you've got really any estimate of a pull-forward impact. But with the sales plan not really changing over the balance of the year, so just incremental conservatism given the macro outlook or just help us why not the full flow-through of the first quarter beat?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, I think, as we thought about our annual outlook, certainly we wanted to reflect the very strong performance we had in Q1. But I think, as we sat back, we also are looking here and saying, \"Well, we're through one quarter of the year. You got Q2, Q3, Q4 yet to go.\" And as Kathy talked about, our view of the macro environment really hasn't changed appreciably in the last 90 days. So while we enjoyed some weather pull-forward and had the right merchandise absolutely in Q1, and you see the benefit of that in our performance, we think that our current outlook is a reasonable outlook for our business given the very strong performance in Q1 but the fact that we've got a lot of wood left to chop here in the year before we get to the end.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That\u2019s great. That makes sense. And then just one follow-up. Your sales comparisons do start to get a bit tougher in June and July. That's when the business really started to pick up last year. The second quarter comp plan of around 3%, is that consistent across the months? Or do you assume some sort of deceleration over the June, July time frame? Or are we getting too specific there?","John J. Mulligan","It's pretty granular, but I think we feel pretty comfortable with all the months relatively consistently as we look across Q2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Actually, 2 questions for Kathy. The first one, Kathy, just the -- I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the drivers to keep category gross margins improving, sort of how you're doing that, is it -- if it isn't mix shift that you guys are looking for to keep gross margin going up, so just some commentary on that. And then also, not to corner you, but while I have you, I think I bought 3 or 4 Kindles at your stores literally over the last 12 months, and I was hoping you could maybe give some of us some more insight into the thinking behind taking that out of your stores.","Kathryn A. Tesija","Sure. For the first question, Robbie, in terms of the gross margin, certainly, mix helped us, as I said earlier, with Apparel. And as we grow Apparel, that definitely is positive. Owned brands is another one that's positive, that we continue to grow and intend to for the future, which will help us. In terms of rates and how we're doing that, I think it's a number of things. There's not one single contributor, but it's optimizing our prices across-the-board, whether that's our regular retail, our promotional retails or our clearance. There's a lot of work that we do with that, as well as, as guests are trading up into better brands, there's typically more profit in those brands. So it's a wide mixture of things that are driving it. And certainly, our inventory control helps that as well. In terms of the Kindle, we continually go through an assessment of our assortments, and we felt that this is the appropriate decision for us to make at this time. So we will be phasing out the Kindle products throughout the spring here of 2012, and we will be out by early summer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions, one back on e-commerce. Kathy and\/or Gregg, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit more about any sort of category dynamics that are leading you to conclusions about kind of opportunities you have where there've been deficiencies, where you're tracking below your plan or below what you'd expect, given your store penetration in those categories. And how much of the improvement going forward will come from tech investments in the service levels versus just approaching that channel differently from a merchandising standpoint?","Kathryn A. Tesija","Jeff, there's a lot of things that are leading us to decide what it is that we want to -- where we want to make improvements. Some of them are on the category dynamics and how we're selling, but even in categories where sales are fairly robust -- Apparel sales online have been fairly robust -- I still think that there's a lot of improvements that we can make. So a lot of the metrics I talked about earlier are things that affect the whole site, things like speed and search, our order fulfillment. And so we've just done, as a team, a deep assessment of how we think we're performing, where the site is slower, how good our search function is relative to some of our competitors. And that, along with the category dynamics, are driving us to where we think we need to make changes. And I would tell you that it's a combination of investment in technology but also in our process and just how we're going about our business and, certainly, to your point, our approach to multichannel versus a separate channel and how we're looking at the overall strategy by business and how that plays out online, I think, will strengthen our ability to sell product there. But a large investment will happen in technology to make us faster and smoother and easier for the guests to navigate.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups on that. In terms of the technology investment cycle, at what point do you feel like you'll be kind of through that and, from that point forward, sort of leveraging that new tech investment? And then also in terms of the merchandising staffing, will you maintain separate staffs, separate merchandising groups, going forward for those? Or will you look to more kind of integration between channels, going forward?","Kathryn A. Tesija","I'm not -- I don't know that I can tell you about the tech investment of when we will leverage that. We are investing heavily now and see that we will into the future. It's a key part of our business, not only the product that's sold online but, of course, all of the sales in stores that are influenced by the research that's done online. So it's a key part of our business that we will invest in for a very long time. In terms of the staffing, I don't know that we've made a decision specifically on what will be separate and what will be together, but we work together on setting the strategy for each category. And then we do have separate buying teams today, although they are ever-increasingly working more closely together as the channels kind of merge and complement each other. So I think, in terms of what that looks like, that's something we will assess for a very long time, but I don't see any big changes in the short term. We are adding to that team, that's probably the biggest change, and we have been now for quite some time as it's been growing.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","I'd just add: I think, over time, we'll likely end up in some kind of a hybrid of where we are today. We've had separate and distinct teams. We have co-located and done some integrations both in terms of the strategy and the physical placements of our team. And I -- we think over time that we'll continue along those lines, although it's unlikely that everything would be integrated together. So there will be some teams that are co-located and are very, very integrated physically, strategically, and there will be other parts that will remain a little bit more separate, although, as Kathy said, we take one approach to the business, one strategy, and then it's just how we execute that across both the physical and the online space.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's very helpful. Just one other final question on Canada. In terms of the kind of market research or consumer testing you're doing in that market leading up to your opening, I mean, it seems that you have some opportunities in that market that would certainly be very distinct from the U.S. where you could index potentially very high relative to your average in potentially Apparel and other discretionary categories. Just curious about that process, how you're preparing for those potential differences.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, you're right. We do believe that's a whitespace opportunity for us. And we've done a lot of research, a lot of different kinds of research, and there's no one aspect that leads to any one conclusion. We continue to listen and learn and get close to the Canadian consumer. Many of them are very familiar with the brand, either shop in our stores or they are current REDcard product holders, so there's a high familiarity of the Target brand. And they're looking for the Target experience. They really want the full-blown Target brand experience as we come to get Canada. So that, first and foremost, is our -- our priority is to deliver a great Target experience across all categories, great service, great team engagement. And then because there is -- what we believe is some whitespace in Apparel and Home, we're going to go after those businesses, and we'll look to over-index and over -- or invest a little bit more heavily in the space and some of the physical assets so that we can take advantage of what we believe is going to be a great opportunity for us to deliver our Expect More. Pay Less. strategy in those categories. So we would agree with you on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two quick questions. I guess one of them is a follow-up on the question about Canada. If you could look back to when you decided initially to go into Canada compared to today, what changes do you see in the competitive environment over that period? And does that at all change your outlook? That's question number one. And then second, can you just give us an update on the cross-shopping of multiple areas within the store for guests who've signed up for the 5% Rewards card? Are the -- is the basket for that customer -- you mentioned it increased. Does it represent all areas of the store? Or is it concentrated in any particular area of the store?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Looking back on Canada at this point in time, we don't see anything that we would do differently. I mean, the -- it's really the Canadian consumer that's going to benefit by our entry. We're -- we hope to become their favorite store as we enter into that. But clearly, all of the Canadian competitors are anticipating our arrival, as well as the Canadian consumers, and so they are improving their value proposition, they're investing in their asset base, they're improving their experience. And ultimately, that is just going to better serve the Canadian market. We hope to launch very successfully and wow them with our content, value proposition, speed of service and all the wonderful things that we do, Target here in the U.S. We look to do that in Canada as well. And ultimately, the Canadians are going to have a far-superior shopping experience across all channels due to our entry. But there really isn't anything that we look back in hindsight and say, \"Hey, we would do anything different,\" at this point in time.","John J. Mulligan","Right. And on the 5% Rewards basket question. We see a basket in the incremental lift that is very, very similar to the baskets of that guest prior to their experience. There's a very, very small mix impacting gross margin, but it is insignificant relative to our gross margin or the performance of the 5% Rewards program.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, November 15, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising and Supply Chain; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and highlight some of our enterprise strategic priorities, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. And finally, John will provide more detail on our third quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of 2012. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","We're very pleased with Target's third quarter financial performance, which we announced earlier this morning. Our U.S. operations generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, above the midpoint of our guidance and 4.3% above last year's very strong performance.","Our third quarter GAAP earnings per share increased 17.6% to $0.96, as dilution related to our Canadian segment investments was more than offset by favorable tax items and a gain on the pending sale of our receivables portfolio.","Our U.S. Retail segment generated third quarter comparable-store sales growth of 2.9%, in line with our guidance going into the quarter. And this segment generated an EBIT margin rate a bit ahead of expectations, matching our very strong profit performance in the third quarter of 2011. This profit performance reflects the continued benefit of thoughtful and disciplined expense management throughout the organization.","For the last 2 years, we have relied on this discipline to offset gross margin rate investments we've made in our 2 most visible growth strategies: 5% REDcard Rewards and our PFresh remodel program.  I want to thank our team for reliably delivering on this expectation quarter after quarter, successfully controlling expense growth while continuing to provide an outstanding experience for our guests.","We also remain focused on improving our online shopping experience, which has resulted in robust growth in online sales and meaningful increases in guest satisfaction scores. In addition, as we further increase the functionality and ease-of-use of our award-winning mobile apps, we continue to generate rapid growth in the mobile channel.","We've rolled out free in-store WiFi across the chain, allowing guests to research products and use our apps while they're shopping in our stores. And we'll continue to integrate digital features into our fourth quarter marketing, incorporating QR codes in our store signing and marketing vehicles. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest meaningful resources to ensure our stores, online and mobile platforms provide a seamless experience that allow our guests to engage with us, wherever and whenever they choose.","We continue to be pleased with initial results from our newest format in the United States, CityTarget. After 2 additional third quarter openings, we now have 5 CityTarget stores operating in 4 different metropolitan areas: Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. As expected, initial traffic to these stores have been strong, while gross margin mix has been slightly better than expected. The CityTarget team has done an outstanding job, accomplishing a virtually flawless launch of this new format. We plan to open 3 more CityTarget locations in 2013.","Our U.S. Credit Card segment delivered another outstanding quarter, with risks at historically low levels and profitability near historic highs. In addition, following extensive efforts, we were very excited about this quarter's announcement of our agreement to sell our Credit Card portfolio to TD Bank Group, accomplishing all of our goals for a sale, including moving the assets off our balance sheet, maintaining the deep integration between our Retail and Credit Card operations, continuing to earn the majority of profits generated by this high-quality portfolio and importantly, finding the right partner who will be aligned with our goals for portfolio growth and profitability. We're pleased to be working with the outstanding management team at TD Bank, and we look forward to closing this transaction in the first half of 2013.","In our Canadian segment, we're moving forward in our efforts to open our first stores by next April. We now have 45 stores under renovation, and we have 1 distribution center operating and another one scheduled to come online soon. And we are on track with implementation and testing for our Canadian segment technology platform.","Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of talent we are hiring for our Canadian team, both at headquarters and for our stores organization who will serve as the primary ambassadors for the Target brand. While there are many significant milestones to come, we feel very good about our ability to open our first Canadian stores on time, on budget and on brand.","As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we feel very good about our ability to deliver inspiring merchandise, most wanted gifts and unbeatable value, while also generating expected profitability. Our stores are ramping up their preparations to deliver a Target brand experience on Thanksgiving weekend, delivering must-have items at incredible prices for an event which promises to be bigger than ever. Following that weekend, we will launch a series of merchandising and marketing plans designed to sustain excitement all the way to Christmas, with our groundbreaking partnership with Neiman Marcus at the top of the list. Kathy will provide more detail in a few minutes, but with more than 2 billion media impressions already, this event is clearly creating a lot of excitement.","While programs like Neiman Marcus event continue to elevate the Expect More side of our brand promise, we know that it's crucial for Target to continue to combine differentiation with unbeatable value. That's why we're very pleased to announce our new online price match and extended Holiday Price Match at our media event last month. These programs are yet another way we work to assure our guests that they can feel good about shopping at Target. The fact that we can offer these programs convey our confidence in Target's prices, which are consistently low every day and even lower when we run a promotion. These programs, along with our ongoing price match guarantee and 5% Rewards, allow our guests to shop at Target, a store they love, with the confidence that they're getting the very best deal.","And importantly, price matching is fully integrated into our overall profit plan for the fourth quarter. As you know, every year, we invest aggressively in price to provide value during the holiday season. Our price matching programs complement our holiday promotional plan, and we believe they are a smart way to invest in price to deliver compelling value for our guests.","While we continually look for ways to broaden our reach and appeal to a wider set of guests, we believe our first and best opportunity lies in deepening our relationship with our core guests, earning additional trips and spending from them. A prime example is 5% REDcard Rewards, which motivates our current guests to shop at Target much more often, generating an average sales increase of more than 50% in households that begin using a REDcard.","This program turns less-engaged guests into some of our best guests, and makes our best guests even more valuable. We're on pace to add over 3 million credit and debit accounts this year, creating a powerful platform to provide additional loyalty features. For example, last month, we announced that in addition to saving 5% on every purchase in stores and at target.com and earning free shipping on all target.com purchases, REDcard holders will now receive an extra 30 days to return their purchases, if needed.","Guest response to 5% Rewards continue to exceed our expectations, as penetration of sales on our cards rose to a record 14% in the third quarter. This is nearly 3x the 5.5% penetration we experienced 2 years ago in the third quarter of 2010 when we launched the program nationwide.","Similarly, our PFresh remodel program, which launched in 2009, was a result of research with core guests who told us they would shop at Target more often if we provided them a more compelling food assortment, including perishables. The addition of a deeper food assortment gave us the opportunity to completely reinvent our general merchandise format,  transforming categories throughout the store in a visually compelling environment. Today, we operate 1,130 stores that have either been remodeled or newly built with this layout. And our guests continue to tell us they love what we've done to their Target store.","Together, 5% Rewards and our remodel program are making Target more relevant to our guests than ever, creating an outstanding platform for future innovations in our merchandising and loyalty programs.","As I look across our business today, I'm very pleased with our performance throughout the enterprise. Our team is doing an outstanding job of balancing strategic innovation with day-to-day excellence in execution.","The team is aligned and motivated in support of our strategic roadmap and delivery of our long-range financial plan. And as John will cover in more detail, we're anticipating 2012 adjusted EPS that will keep us on track in the delivery of that long-range financial plan.","Before I turn the call over to Kathy, I want to personally thank the thousands of Target team members in the Northeast who have worked tirelessly to help their local communities recover from Superstorm Sandy. Our thoughts and prayers are with those whose lives were affected by this terrible storm.","Now Kathy will provide more detail on our third quarter results, recent guest insights and provide more detail on initiatives for the fourth quarter and beyond. Kathy?","Kathryn A. Tesija","Thanks, Gregg. We are pleased with both the pace and mix of our third quarter sales. As expected, comps were strongest in less discretionary categories, with particular strength in Food and Health & Beauty.","In more discretionary categories, comparable-store sales in Home led the way, most notably in seasonal categories and Housewares. Comps in Apparel were up slightly, with the strongest results in Men's Apparel and Performance Activewear.","In Hardlines, comps were down slightly overall, with the strongest performance in Sporting Goods and the softest performance in Electronics, which continued to reflect mature product cycles in several key categories.","Strengthen in Back-to-School and Back-to-College categories was a key driver of our third quarter sales results. This year's comprehensive marketing campaigns drove guest awareness, and our in-store navigation and signing streamlined and simplified shopping trips for our guests.","As Gregg mentioned, we're very excited about initial results in our new CityTarget stores. Traffic has been very strong, and guest feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Initial research indicates that the typical guest in this new urban format is younger and more affluent than we see on average across the chain. And as expected, these stores are attracting many new guests.","We continue to make significant investments in our online and mobile platforms, both to improve the performance of our existing site and mobile applications, and to test and inform future opportunities. Throughout the year, our teams have been focused on ensuring site stability and enhancing our search and navigation capabilities.","More recently, we've improved our speed of checkout, order flow and fulfillment. As a result, our online guest survey scores are much higher than a year ago, and our mobile apps continue to receive industry accolades. And importantly, we believe we are well prepared for the upcoming launch of the Target Neiman Marcus holiday collection and the peak traffic levels of the holiday season. While we feel good about the progress we've made, continuing to improve the guest experience remains a top priority for 2013.","In addition to the specific investments we're making in online and mobile channels, we're also investing in ways to further integrate the shopping experience across channels. For instance, we recently installed new scanners at point of sale in all of our stores to make mobile coupon redemption smoother and faster than ever.","We are expanding our use of shoppable media, incorporating QR codes and text-to-buy features. And in October, we launched an online debit and credit card application on target.com and saw an immediate meaningful increase in overall REDcard applications.","Our research with guests indicates they are continuing to shop with discipline, focusing on lists and budgets and occasionally splurging on more discretionary items. Notably in the third quarter, we saw an increase in trips, focused only on need-based items. This guest feedback corresponds to overall consumer sentiment data, showing that while consumers have increased confidence about their near-term prospects and personal finances, they have a high level of uncertainty about the longer-term health of the economy and intend to continue saving and paying down debt. For the holiday season, consumers anticipate spending slightly more than last year, but indicate they'll be focused on value, pricing and promotions.","This data informs our outlook for the fourth quarter and next year. We continue to position our inventory appropriately, maintaining the flexibility to chase sales when we experience unexpected demand, while simultaneously managing markdown risk.","Beyond this focus on order quantity for each season, we continually work to find opportunities to reduce our inventory investment by optimizing our supply chain. In fact, while you'll note that our total inventory at the end of the third quarter was lower than last year, more than 100% of that decline was due to a reduction in inventory outside our stores. Levels of inventory located within our stores, where it's available to be purchased by our guests, were up slightly from a year ago at the end of the quarter.","Looking ahead, we are confident in our holiday merchandising and marketing plans. As always, we expect the season to be highly competitive and promotional, and we have the compelling assortments and exceptional value to make Target the top shopping destination for our guests.","In Toys, we're focused on ensuring our guests know that Target has the best values, especially on must-have items. In store, we've created QR codes for each of our top 20 Toys, which allow guests to purchase items by scanning the codes on store shelves and having them shipped anywhere in the U.S. for free.","Our annual toy catalog features more than 200 toys, specially priced, to give guests the best value on the toys kids really want. Guests can browse the catalogue online and create a Target digital wish list that is instantly shareable via email. And the target.com\/toptoys page is the ultimate online destination for toy lovers of all ages. This site contains links to more than 10,000 toys, including more than 300 exclusives from Barbie, Fisher-Price, LEGO and Target-owned brands such as the Circo and Play Wonder.","In Music, our exclusive partnerships ensure we've got something for everyone, with albums in-store now from P!nk, No Doubt, Rod Stewart and Taylor Swift. In fact, our exclusive Taylor Swift album, RED, became our top-selling CD release of all-time. And we're keeping the momentum in Music going with our partnership with the hot U.K. pop group, One Direction, which we announced last month. That album, which just set earlier this week, is already off to a very strong start.","We're also investing heavily in our Latin music business, allocating more in-store space in key markets and partnering with legends like Emilio Estefan to curate our collection. Our Target exclusive version of Tony Bennett's new Duets album, which set a few weeks ago, features the hottest artists in Latin music.","This year, our merchandising and product design and development teams have created a multi-layered gifting strategy in categories across the store. In Apparel, we've rolled out gifting trees, showcasing colorful product with lots of shimmer and shine. In Home, we've expanded our boxed gift program with amazing prices on unique items in beautiful boxes that are easy to wrap and give. And we've transformed our See. Spot. Save. area in the front of the store to a stocking stuffer destination.","And of course, at the top of our gifting strategy, we're thrilled about our unprecedented partnership with Neiman Marcus and 24 of the most influential and sought-after designers in the country. This unique collection of 50 great gifts, that are certain to wow our guests, will set in stores December 1. Like any limited time offer, we expect these items to sell quickly, particularly given the amazing media attention that we've already received, as Gregg mentioned earlier.","Beyond this gifting strategy, we're very pleased with results from our 2 newest brands in Home. The Nate Berkus collection, sold exclusively at Target, has already been a hit with guests since setting late last month. This signature Home collection features bedding, bath, accessories, lighting, rugs and window treatments. This will be an ongoing collection with new items added to the assortment in 2013.","And we're pleased with the launch of our new owned-brand collection, Threshold, which offers guests a fully redesigned, high-quality collection that will inspire and help update their homes. The collection debuted this quarter with a small assortment of entertaining essentials, accents and decorative accessories, and will continue to roll out through spring 2013.","We are pleased with our third quarter performance and believe we are well positioned to give our guests a superior shopping experience and drive profitable growth in what will certainly be a highly promotional fourth quarter. And as we look beyond this quarter in the holiday season, we believe our merchandising and marketing strategies will continue to engage our guests, strengthen their love of the brand and deliver strong financial results for Target.","Now John will share his insights on our third quarter performance and outlook going forward. John?","John J. Mulligan","Thanks, Kathy. Even though we were cycling over our strongest quarterly performance in 2011, this year's third quarter results reflected strong profitable growth.","Retail sales were in line with our guidance, and profitability was near the high end of our expectations, with a superb execution across each of our business segments. Specifically, we generated third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.90, compared with an expected range of $0.83 to $0.93 going into the quarter. Third quarter GAAP EPS was $0.96, reflecting $0.13 of dilution related to our Canadian segment, offset by a $0.15 gain due to the pending sale of our Credit Card portfolio, along with $0.04 of good news from a resolution of income tax matters.","In our U.S. Retail segment, comparable store sales increased 2.9%, consistent with our guidance for the quarter. This comp was slightly slower than our second quarter performance, but on a 2-year basis, our third quarter comp accelerated slightly. Similar to last quarter, comparable store sales were primarily driven by an increase in average ticket, combined with a traffic increase of 0.5%. Penetration of sales on our credit and debit cards was 14% in the third quarter, up more than 400 basis points from a year ago. As Gregg mentioned, this program shows no signs of slowing down and continues to drive meaningful incremental traffic and sales.","Profitability in the U.S. Retail segment was somewhat better than expected. Our third quarter EBIT margin rate was flat to last year, and our EBITDA margin rate was down only slightly, even as we compared against very strong prior-year performance. Recall that for the year, our plan was to generally maintain our full year EBITDA and EBIT margins flat to last year. And our results for the first 9 months show that we're right on track to meet that expectation.","Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, third quarter gross margin rate was down a couple of tenths from a year ago, as gross margin investments in 5% Rewards and higher frequency category mix from our PFresh remodel program, were partially offset by rate improvements within categories.","Our merchandising team has done a great job managing margins within their individual businesses, a key factor in delivering profitability in our U.S. Retail segment.","Third quarter SG&A rate was flat to a year ago, reflecting continued expense discipline across the organization, combined with the impact of higher expenses related to technology and multi-channel investments.","Our U.S. Credit Card segment had another great quarter, earning more than 9 percentage points above LIBOR. Profit dollars were down slightly due to a 4.7% decline in average receivables and a more modest reserve release compared with third quarter 2011. Importantly, delinquencies and write-off rates continue to decline from what are already historically low levels.","In our Canadian segment, we continue to invest in technology, supply chain, store renovations and the team as we prepare to open stores in spring of next year. These activities led to $72 million of SG&A expense in the third quarter which, when combined with D&A expense and interest expense associated with the segment, reduced our third quarter GAAP EPS by $0.13.","Even as we engage in significant investments to launch our Canadian segment, our operations are generating excess cash that we continue to return to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we paid dividends of $236 million and invested just over $100 million in share repurchase. Through the first 3 quarters of 2012, we invested about $1.9 billion in dividends and share repurchase, an amount representing more than 90% of our net income.","Our priorities for deployment of capital remain unchanged. We invest in our core businesses on projects that fit our strategic and financial criteria. We support the dividend, and we engage in share repurchase with the goal of maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings.","In the third quarter, we announced our agreement to sell our Credit Card portfolio to TD Bank for the gross value of the receivables at time of closing. We plan to deploy the proceeds from this sale in a manner that's neutral to our debt ratings. Given the amount of leverage we've applied to these assets, we expect that following closing, we will invest 10% or a little more of the proceeds, in our current share repurchase program, and the remainder in debt production over time. We continue to expect to close this transaction with TD in the first half of 2013.","Now let's turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We're expecting fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase in the 2% to 3% range. Sales in this range would lead to a full year comp of 3% or more, consistent with our long-range plan and our expectations going into the year.","As you know, we have a 53rd accounting week this year. Because we measure our comparable-store sales over periods of equal length, our fourth quarter comp will not reflect sales in the extra week. As a result, the gap between Target's fourth quarter total and comparable-store sales will be much larger than normal. We expect fourth quarter REDcard penetration will increase 400 basis points or more above last year, consistent with our recent experience.","In Kansas City, where we launched REDcard Rewards a year earlier than the rest of the country, penetration reached 20% this month, in advance of an expected temporary decline due to normal seasonal pattern. This milestone is notable because 20% penetration represented a stretch goal when we launched REDcard Rewards. And given that so far, our nationwide experience has followed Kansas City 1 year later, we expect to mirror this performance across the chain in fourth quarter 2013.","In the U.S. Retail segment, we expect our fourth quarter EBIT margin will be essentially flat to last year, driven by a moderate decline in our gross margin rate, offset by leverage on the SG&A and D&A expense lines.","In the Credit Card segment, we expect to earn a spread to LIBOR of 8% or more, generating spread to LIBOR dollars in line with our third quarter performance. However, given that we've already cycled the large reserve releases in 2011, this performance will represent an increase in year-over-year dollar profitability for the first time this year.","Combining all these expectations, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS representing results from our U.S. operations, of $1.64 to $1.74. This performance would put us at the high end of the full year guidance we provided last quarter and would put us ahead of our long-range plan's 2012 benchmark on our journey to achieving EPS of $7.20 or more in the U.S. by 2017.","In Canada, we anticipate that expenses will grow beyond our third quarter experience as we begin to hire a large group of team members to open our first stores in the spring. Canadian D&A will also increase as we continue to invest in technology and supply chain to serve these stores.","Our current expectation is that activities related to our Canadian market launch will reduce our fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.19. Combined with our expectation for adjusted EPS, this dilution would lead to fourth quarter GAAP EPS $1.45 to $1.55. While the economic environment this year has not been as robust as many of us would've hoped, our business has performed beyond our expectations.","Specifically, 9 months ago in our year end 2011 conference call, I laid out an expectation for full year 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.55 to $4.75. Given 3 quarters of actual results, combined with the fourth quarter outlook I just outlined, we now expect full year adjusted EPS of $4.75 to $4.85. This means the low end of our current range would put us at the high end of our expectations going into the year.","Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","As Kathy, John and I have all indicated this morning, we're very pleased with our team's performance and the financial results we delivered in the third quarter.","While we recognize that the fourth quarter and the holiday season are always intensely competitive, we are excited about the plans we have in place, confident in our team's ability to execute and optimistic about our ability to capture our fair share of our guests' hearts and wallets.","Now Kathy, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Starting on the top line, could you just talk about the impact of either inflation or deflation and what you're seeing in terms of either Food or Apparel at this point in the game?","John J. Mulligan","Deb, this is John. I don't think we're seeing really any material impact from the top line due to inflation in any of our categories -- specific categories across the store. And certainly, as we would aggregate that across the store, as has been the case for the past several years, in aggregate, inflation impact is immaterial to our results.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then as we're looking at SG&A, should we expect tech investments that are expensed to stay at the same run rate that was experienced in the third quarter?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, I think that's pretty reasonable. We continue to invest meaningfully in technology across the enterprise. And as we've said, we're also investing now in multi-channel initiatives across the enterprise and specifically around dotcom. But like I just said in the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to leverage SG&A expense in the fourth quarter despite those investments ongoing.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then as your online performance continues to improve, how do you think about the halo effect from the stores and leverage that? And then any thoughts on buying online and shipping to the store?","Kathryn A. Tesija","You know, Deb, we do think that there is a halo effect when our site is performing well. As you know, guests do a lot of research online, but then they want to come into stores and purchase. And of course, there's a lot of people who come into the store, see the product and perhaps want a different color that we offer online. So after looking at the product, decide to still order through target.com because they want something that we offer that's different online. So we see sales going back and forth between the 2 all the time, which does make those channels blur quite a bit. But I think the health of our site certainly impacts the health of our stores. And I'm sorry, what was your -- the second part of your...","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Buy online, ship to store.","Kathryn A. Tesija","Buy online, ship to store. At this point, we are not offering that service to our guests. But it is something that we've been talking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just wanted to focus on the REDcard a little bit. It looks like the penetration, the year-on-year increase in penetration, was actually accelerating a little bit and with Kansas City at 20%, it certainly suggests there's a lot of upside potential. What do you think is driving that? I've noticed that there's certainly a bigger push behind marketing the program. And is there any difference in the recent, let's say, 400- to 500-basis-point penetration of the newer cardholders or what you're seeing in Kansas City? Any difference in their behavior in terms of incremental spend, in terms of the FICO score, in terms of anything relative to the first, let's say, 10% to 12% penetration?","John J. Mulligan","Well, we'll try to answer all 6 of those questions in order. I think you hit it right on the head, we are seeing the performance of the REDcards continue to accelerate, and we've seen that both in Kansas City and in the U.S., and our penetration continue to increase. I think the big driver, and we've talked about this a couple of times this year, continues to be the debit card. The debit card continues to grow roughly at about 3 accounts for every one account of credit, and that has been kind of the secret sauce in the significant growth. As far as performance of the card, we continue to see both either a debit or a credit card, once they're opened, more than a 50% increase in sales on average at a household level. So the performance remains very similar to what we've seen for the past couple of years, both in Kansas City and in the broader -- in our entire store base. And I'm trying to think what else, what else you asked, Colin?","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I think that was it. But if 20% was the stretch goal, what's the stretch stretch goal now?","John J. Mulligan","Hard to say. I think 20%, I think we said about -- if you'd have asked us a year ago, we would've said we thought 20% was the top. Obviously, with Kansas City hitting that for a period of time, and as we said, that will come back here in the fourth quarter just due to the dynamics of the quarter, we'd expect the company to be there next year, and we think there's just a very long runway here. We think the product is an outstanding offer. Clearly, our guests are starting to understand it. The store teams are doing a great job as they communicate with our guests, helping them understand both the credit and the debit offering. So you wrap that all together, and we think there's a long runway here.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Yes, we haven't -- we see no reason to establish an upside benchmark at this point. And I would just add from -- in addition to what John said, our guests really love this because Target is their favorite store or a favorite store of theirs to shop to begin with. And this is a very powerful, immediate and simple program. I mean, they -- we have a lot of our guests that spend thousands of dollars, and that 5% savings, along with the other bets [ph], is a meaningful savings to them. And you don't have to accumulate points or anything. And the debit card in particular has been very, very successful. So those shoppers who are coming to Target on a very regular basis can save a lot of money throughout the course of the year. So it's very understandable why they like this program so much.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then second question for Kathy. Neiman Marcus, what's your expectation for cross shopping that customer who comes in for the relatively limited 50 items? And can you tell us at all what the dollar value of the inventory was in Neiman Marcus products?","Kathryn A. Tesija","We do think that there will be a lot of cross shopping, Colin, as we've seen with other limited-time partnerships that we've had, but we think particularly this time of the year, the guest is coming in to buy gifts, maybe some self gifting, but also gifts for people on their list. And Target is a great place to get gifts of all type. And so we think they'll come in for Neiman Marcus, but we do think that they will shop the rest of the store, and there will be some impact. In terms of the inventory and the dollar amount, we don't disclose what we buy or sell on these limited partnerships. But we are very excited about it.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","And it will be our biggest event, our biggest partnership event that we've ever conducted at a great time of year as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","On the new Holiday Price Match, what's your expectation for the portion of transactions that might have this price match? Is this low single digits? And then given that price transparency is here to stay, might you consider doing this as a full-time measure?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Yes, this is Gregg. We don't see a lot of price match activity in our stores. We've been price matching for a long time. Our value proposition is so good day in and day out, and our circular price offering is so good that we don't expect this to be meaningful. So it will be in the -- we expect in the single digits. And we'll take a look and evaluate this post-holiday to determine what our plan is going forward. We haven't made any decisions as it relates to that at this point in time and really want to get through the have the period and regroup and assess the campaigns to determine how to address 2013.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then I may have missed it, but can you give us a sense for how you're tracking in November? And what is the comp range expected for fourth quarter?","John J. Mulligan","As you might expect, the beginning of the month was a little bit choppy, certainly with Sandy on the East Coast, the election, a few things going on. But we feel really good about the guidance we gave for November of a low and more important than that, we feel really good about the quarter, the 2% to 3% comp that we just talked about for the quarter.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","So much of the -- I mean, we have 2 weeks down, 11 weeks in front of us, and we have so much of the business concentrated in that Thanksgiving weekend and in the 10 days before holidays, so that the vast majority of the holiday season is in front of us at this particular point in time. So we're excited about it. We've got a great plan. Our stores are ready, our teams are ready. We've got a great value offering and some really inspiring merchandise. So we believe we'll profitably take market share this holiday season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the Credit Card, you mentioned you're going to retain a majority of the profits. What are we going to see there in terms of reporting moving forward and just a little perspective there?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, we did say the majority of the profits. I think as we indicated, when we made the announcement, ultimately, we will report, as everyone else does once they no longer own the assets, we'll report the net impact, the income less the expenses that we incur for servicing those assets in SG&A within our Retail segment. So that's our plan going forward.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just for Canada, as we start to look forward there, when do you expect to give us an outlook on the dilution we could expect for 2013? And then what's the arc there? As you start with the sales, are you expecting kind of weak margins to start? And how do we think about the progression once it gets going?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, we'll -- we're working on detailed plans for both Canada and the U.S. business both, and we'll walk you guys through our exact plans financially when we do the fourth quarter conference call. I think importantly for Canada, probably the most important thing is that the Q4 of next year is when we have said we'll move from dilution to accretion. So our focus is on getting profitable in Q4 2013, and we feel good about that right now. I think when the stores open up, there's a lot of variables there. We said for a long time, we have a better idea of where the stores will be in year 2 or year 3 than we do in year 1. Lots of volatility, we'll certainly see a surge early, and then we'll settle in and we'll refine as we go along, both our merchandising assortment and how we operate those stores. So I think we would expect to see sales and margins we will -- we do expect to see both sales and margins improve as we go along. But by that, I don't mean you should be looking quarter-over-quarter. This will take us a couple of years to refine our operating model in Canada.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the Neiman question. Gregg, you mentioned that it's the biggest event ever. Am I correct that it's bigger than Missoni was last September? I thought you had about 150 products, so that sounds like you're expecting to have more inventory of a smaller assortment here?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, it will be substantially larger than Missoni, but this is more tightly edited in terms of the number of items that we have. So the commitment behind each item will be substantially more than any event that we've ever done. And given the time of year that it is and the fact that these will make great holiday gifts, the inventory on a per-item basis is something that we've never supported in the past. Missoni and some of other ones have had hundreds of SKUs, as you know, and this has a much more narrowly-defined assortment base.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Perfect. So you're not selling out in day 1.5 this time?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, we're hopeful that this is our biggest success yet, but we're not making any predictions as it relates to the sell-through timetable. Like any event of this magnitude, there are going to be some items that sell through very, very quickly and other items that will take a little bit longer to sell through. But overall, we look at the entire assortment, we look at the portfolio of designers, and we think across the board, there's something for everyone. So we think it's going to be successful across the board. It's just a matter of how you want to gauge success, is it hours, or days, or possibly a week, which might be a stretch.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Perfect. Then one follow-up. On the grocery side, grocery comps moderated in October. And so I was just wondering if you could help us with how much of that was moderation of price inflation versus cycling the hump of the PFresh opens last year? And what do you think is sort of a sustainable comp is in that category, assuming inflation doesn't really go anywhere from here?","John J. Mulligan","I think as we look at October, we think very little to do really with inflation in that category. We think the majority of what we saw in October was cycling over what was, by far, our largest PFresh remodel program in one cycle last year. As we think about grocery going forward, mid to high comps seem reasonable for us for a run rate as we look ahead here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","John, a question on leverage and then on online for Gregg or Kathy. On leverage, ex credit, it seems like you should be a little under 2x debt-to-EBITDA versus 2.5x now. Is that where -- well is my math is right; and two, is that where you want to run the business long term, or should we assume it goes up a little bit above 2x again?","John J. Mulligan","Your math is pretty correct, Greg, and I think that's about the range that you'll see us operate in. As we've said, we want to maintain the current credit ratings that we're at, and we believe as we talk to the agencies, and we'll go back and talk to them again, obviously, once all the dust settles from the receivables transactions, but we believe that's about the right range where we'll continue to operate.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then -- that's helpful. And second on online, I mean, last year, that was an area where you were down, and I know that was a disappointment. I'm just curious in this year's fourth quarter guidance, what do you expect from online sales growth? And linked to that, how much is REDcard penetration in terms of online sales? I imagine it's quite higher than the 14%.","John J. Mulligan","Yes, first, as it relates to the impact on the comp, as we said last year, when it was not helpful, it wasn't material. And this year, while we do believe it will be helpful to the comp, it won't be a material portion of it. And I think you're exactly right, the REDcard penetration online is higher than we see in the stores. And as you might expect, in certain categories, it is significantly higher than we see in the stores, given the 5% off plus the free shipping online, you don't have to let your mind wander too far to think about categories where the penetration is probably pretty significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of questions. John, first of all, just on the tax rate. We've consistently seen some benefits here for the last several quarters. So I'm just curious, as you think about the fourth quarter, maybe some parameters around how you think the tax rate is going to come in? And then secondly, on inventory, you mentioned that there was less outside the stores. Is that something -- is that a structural change that we should be thinking about, or something that was just a bit more unique to this period?","John J. Mulligan","Sure. On the tax rate, I'll take that, and then let Kathy talk about inventory. We have seen several, what we have characterized as onetime events over the past several years, and they have been truly onetime as we have settled many discrete tax matters. I think for fourth quarter, we'd expect to see rates similar to what we saw last year. The caveat I'll put on that is that with Canada, with our dilution growing meaningfully year-over-year, the rate in Canada is much lower than we see in the U.S. and that, of course, puts -- when we have losses, puts pressure on our consolidated tax rates, so some impact related to that, but nothing material.","Kathryn A. Tesija","And on the inventory side, the team has done really an incredible job of managing our inventory, both to be in stock but at the same time optimizing the supply chain to make sure that we're keeping that as tight as we possibly can. A lot of the improvement that we're seeing is just indicative of what's happening right now in our business. So first of all, better management of our receipts in Toys and Home. There's some timing shifts in some gift-giving categories like Electronics. But then as we talked about in the last call as well, longer term, we continue to really succeed in moving a portion of our base inventory out of our distribution centers and our store backrooms and getting it onto the sales floor, which is a huge win for us because that's where guests can shop it. So we continue to work on those initiatives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Not to be too near-term focused, but did I hear you, Gregg, earlier that even with the Sandy impact and the choppiness that you saw, you still feel good about November comps up low single digits?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, we feel that for the quarter, we're going to be within the range that we have described and how we have characterized November. So much of November comes around the Thanksgiving weekend, and that's ahead of us yet. So we still feel good where our plans are for the month and for the quarter.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then beginning of the year, I believe you guys stated the intention to do about $1.5 billion in buyback -- $1.5 billion in buyback. You didn't really do much here in the third quarter. So I was wondering as why, and I guess if you still feel good about that $1.5 billion target for the year?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, I think we actually said $1.5 billion or more. And I think the key is, and you see this in the third quarter in other areas, is we don't do that just on autopilot. I think as we saw, the stock price went up pretty aggressively in third quarter. We always pause to see where the market's really going to land and make sure that we're buying at a reasonable pace for the year. We still think $1.5 billion or more is a reasonable range for us to end in.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and last my question, just to circle up on the Canada topic. A couple of years back, Doug talked about the dilution before you started to make money in that segment, to be about $1. It looks like this year, with last year, will be about $0.62 of dilution. So should we think about the first 3 quarters of next year being about $0.38 of dilution to make up that $1, or is there something different that's changed?","John J. Mulligan","Well, as we -- as I said a little bit earlier, we haven't provided any guidance on 2013 yet. I think if you look back, you'd find that Doug used the words \"For example\" when he talked about that. But I think more important than that, as I said, we'll be back in about 3 months to give you our detailed view of what we think will happen in Canada over the next 4 months. And you kind of hit on it there subtlety, but again, I go back to, I think, Q4 is the key date for next year when we move from dilution to accretion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Maybe Kathy, just a question on the merchandise. In terms of Apparel, you mentioned Men's and Performance as relatively strong in the quarter. And given the comp that you produced in that category, implies maybe a little bit weaker trends in Women's and Kids. Was it more in the fashion, basics or seasonal and anything you can help to do to reinvigorate the growth in those 2 areas for the fourth quarter?","Kathryn A. Tesija","You're correct, our strongest performance were in Men's and our Performance Activewear, which is -- Activewear has been strong really all year, both because it's a great trend in Apparel right now, but also given the quality and the value that we offer in C9, it's been really an exceptional performer. I think the weakness in Kids and ready-to-wear, or relative weakness, I think is mostly driven by seasonal. We saw some really good strength in sort of our better must-have product. But we are still waiting for weather to break in most of the country, and we have a lot of seasonal apparel, both in Kids and in ready-to-wear in particular, which is still off to a slower start. But I do feel great about the holiday season. Our sweaters are starting to sell and some of the other seasonal product that we have in ready-to-wear. So I think our assortment looks good. It's -- we'll see here in the next few weeks.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then I guess, secondly, a question for John. You had mentioned that the SG&A was up a little bit from higher expenses in technology and multi-channel, but should leverage that in Q4. I guess, is this primarily associated with sales from that extra week that you're getting that leverage, or -- and should we expect a higher comp leverage point potentially on SG&A on the U.S. business for the foreseeable future as you make these investments in technology?","John J. Mulligan","Yes, it would start on Q3. I think the other thing I would remark upon relative to Q3, is last year in Q3, we leveraged 40 basis points of SG&A. So when we talked about the quarter at the beginning, at the end in our second quarter conference call, we actually expected to delever a bit more than we did. So we're pretty pleased with our expense discipline across the company in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, certainly, a small element of that is related to the 53rd week. But frankly, most of the expense leverage that comes in the 53rd week is across depreciation and amortization because of the way we expense that. And that's where most of the benefit comes as you might expect. Most of our expenses happen in the 53rd week just like anyone -- any other week. Benefits, payroll, which is obviously our biggest expense across the enterprise, property taxes, that all happens just like normal. So that's the primary benefit. Going forward, we've said that we expect to maintain our EBITDA margin rates. And so we expect to overcome gross margin rate compression with SG&A leverage and to do so at a 3 comp. So nothing's really changed in our formula. We expect to accommodate the investments we're making in multi-channel and technology, both within our capital plan and our SG&A plan going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","On the -- just wanted to follow up on the Apparel question. If we look at what you've been doing with your different partnerships, they're very interesting, they create buzz. I'm curious, in order to get the comp maybe moving up a little bit in Apparel, is there any hope of doing something a little bit more permanent with any of these partnerships? And do you think that your price and value proposition is right?","Kathryn A. Tesija","We feel that having limited time partnerships with designers is the best place for us to be because it allows us to capitalize on current trends in the marketplace and designers who are up and coming, and we've had a great response to that. And throughout the course of the year, our Apparel business has been really solid. So I do think that our price-value relationship is very good. This is an awkward time of the year given how much seasonal product that we have in Apparel and waiting for that weather to break and guests to get really interested in seasonal product, is always sort of a timing issue. But when you look throughout the course of the whole year, our Apparel business has been very solid, and I think it will continue to be solid.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And if I could follow up, last year, I believe on the third quarter call, you had commented about your competitor's layaway program maybe having an impact on you. I'm curious, they started it earlier this year, they actually quantified it today about how much they thought it was extra. We didn't really hear much from you on that. Do you think it had any impact on your business?","Kathryn A. Tesija","I don't think our guests, based on our research, is that interested in layaway. They are interested in great prices every day. So I think our value equation is really important to them, couple that with our Holiday Price Match, which gives them confidence to buy any time during the holiday season and know that if it appears at a lower price from Target or anyone else later in the season, that they can get that price matched, as well as we've talked about with our debit and credit card, getting 5% off, I think that's really critical to our guests, much more so than layaway.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. First, just a follow-up on price match. Although there's not a high usage rate for that, do your focus -- does your focus group research show that having it in place improves loyalty or conversion in the store? And when it is used, is there any disruption to checkout?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","We don't conduct the price match policy at the checkout. We conduct it at the service desk. And our whole strategy is about delivering a great experience and having our guests have confidence in our pricing, our value proposition, day in and day out is rock solid. On ad, we meet or beat the competition, 5% REDcard reward on top of, or in conjunction with our Price Match Guarantee, is a winning combination and unbeatable in the marketplace. So it's very strong, it's very compelling, and we're just -- we're excited about it because the value proposition is so good.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then lastly, I realize there's some runway ahead of us here. But how are you thinking about the 5.3% compare in Q1 early next year? Are there any specific plans in place to comp that in addition to the ongoing benefit of 5%, PFresh and other initiatives?","John J. Mulligan","Well, I think as we said, we haven't provided any specific guidance. But I guess, I would point to Q3 this quarter. We cycled against very strong results this quarter, a 4.3 comp, profit rates, EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were very strong for the quarter, and we just produced another very strong quarter. Obviously, last spring and first quarter, and we talked about in the conference call, it was the perfect storm of good things all happened. We had the right merchandise in our stores, weather was great and people felt great about shopping. So we have some strong business to cycle. But we'll be back to talk about what we intend to produce for results in Q1 in about 3 months.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Okay. Well that concludes Target's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert - Target Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on Target's third quarter performance and our plans and priorities going forward.

Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share.

Brian?","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased with Target's third quarter performance, which reflected a continuation of the positive trends that emerged in the second quarter. We saw continued growth in both our comparable traffic and comparable sales in the face of more difficult prior-year comparisons on both measures.","Digital sales grew 24% on top of 26% a year ago. And we announced new innovative partnerships with both Google and Pinterest that will continue to expand the digital reach of our brand. We saw a meaningful increase in the percent of our sales at regular price, reflecting the benefit of our work to communicate value more clearly and provide our guests confidence that Target assortment is priced right daily.","We rolled out four new owned brands across our home and apparel categories, all of which are off to a great start. And we generated an unprecedented amount of buzz when we announced an amazing new designer partnership with Chip and Joanna Gaines called Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, which launched last week.","We also remodeled 37 stores in the quarter in support of our plan to transform 110 stores this year, and we opened 12 new stores in a single week in October. These stores are located in a diverse array of neighborhoods across the country, ranging from our new Herald Square location in New York City, all the way to our newest location in Honolulu. Beyond the direct financial returns we are seeing on these investments, our guests continue to confirm for us both through their feedback and their shopping decisions that our efforts are paying off.","And finally, this quarter, we made some meaningful announcements regarding our team. In early September, we announced our intent to hire an additional 100,000 team members for the peak holiday season, up from 70,000 a year ago. And later that month, we announced we would increase our minimum wage nationally to $11 an hour in October in support of a commitment to raise our national minimum to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. These investments reflect the value of our team and our commitment to supporting them, as they provide outstanding service to our guests every day.","The strength of our team is never more evident than in times of need. And unfortunately, we faced several natural disasters in the quarter, from hurricanes in Texas and Florida, to wildfires in California. In the face of these challenges, there are countless stories of our team coming together to support each other and their communities, in the face of heartbreaking devastation. While our team was focused on ensuring the safety of their own families, they also worked tirelessly to reopen stores quickly and move needed essentials from other parts of the country in support of our guests, as they returned home and began the long process of rebuilding their homes. So, I want to thank our team, not just for the hard work every day, but their dedication to our guests and communities in times of need.","It was only last February that we walked you through a detailed plan to accelerate investments in our business that will best position Target for continued success in a rapidly changing environment. Our plan included the investment of more than $7 billion of capital over three years to accelerate our progress in support of several key initiatives, including: blending Target's digital and physical shopping experiences; reimagining our existing stores and the labor model to operate them; rolling out new fulfillment options to enhance convenience for our guests; opening new small-format stores in dense urban, suburban and college campus neighborhoods; and reinventing our assortment of exclusive brands to further differentiate Target from everyone else in retail.","On top of this capital commitment, we outlined an investment of $1 billion of operating margin this year. This commitment has allowed us to move fast, invest in our team and reset our value positioning in the marketplace. With three quarters of the year behind us, I am pleased that we are either on track or ahead in delivering all of our goals for the year. And supported by strong execution by our team, our financial results this year have been meaningfully ahead of our expectations.","A key factor in delivering our goals is the ability of our team to move faster than ever before, and nowhere is that speed more evident than our supply chain, where we are rapidly testing and rolling out new fulfillment options for our guests. Already this year, we've taken Target Restock from only a concept to being fully operational in 11 key markets throughout the country, and we continue to expand the list of eligible items while extending the order deadline for next-day delivery.","We've tested and rolled out same-day delivery in four locations in New York City, supported by our recent acquisition of Grand Junction. And we have rapidly tested and rolled out a new Drive Up service in 50 locations in the Twin Cities where we're receiving positive feedback from our guests. With each of these capabilities, the team is rapidly learning and iterating as we expand our reach, and we have plans to further build out all of these fulfillment options in 2018.","We've taken the same approach to our ship-from-store capabilities, which we first rolled out to approximately 140 stores only a few years ago. As we enter the holiday season this year, the count of ship-from-store locations has grown more than tenfold and it's now in more than 1,400 locations across the country.","You'll note that for each of these fulfillment options, our stores play the key role in delivering the experience. This is only one example of the ways that we've been asking more from our team members than ever before, and that's why this year's investment in our team has been so important. We've invested in additional hours to support new services while continuing to be available to assist our guests.","We've invested in the rollout of a new operating model with more specialized roles that support stronger execution and deliver more product expertise on the sales floor. We've invested in training to elevate the guest experience, moving away from task-driven models to a guest-focused mind-set. And we've invested in wages to ensure we can attract and retain the right team members who consistently deliver a differentiated Target experience every day.","So as we move into the busiest time of the year, I feel confident that our stores are better prepared than ever before. And in more than 100 of our stores, guests will be enjoying a newly-transformed environment this holiday season, courtesy of this year's remodel program. Also, in nearly 30 local neighborhoods across the country, guests will be able to enjoy their holiday shopping at a nearby Target store for the first time.","Across every store and on Target.com, guests this holiday season will be able to shop eight new exclusive brands that we launched in 2017 in addition to our outstanding lineup of new and innovative items from our national brand partners. And, of course, throughout the holiday season, we'll deliver unique and inspiring marketing intended to highlight the joy of being together during the holidays.","It's important to remember the role that this year's investments have played in getting us to where we are today. We started this year with a very healthy business, one that generates lots of cash. We made a decision to ramp up the investments of that cash in both capital and operating margin to speed up our progress. Today, we have a very healthy business that generates lots of cash, a business that has seen two consecutive quarters of healthy traffic growth giving us increased confidence as we enter the holiday season.","While the fourth quarter is always intensely competitive, we are entering this holiday season with lots of confidence. Enabled by this year's investments and the tireless efforts of our team, we have an outstanding set of plans this year. And while it's still very early, we've been encouraged with the guest response to the launch of Hearth and Hand, as well as last week's release of the Target exclusive version of Taylor Swift's new album, Reputation. While the bulk of the season is still ahead of us, we are very happy to see how these early efforts have set the tone for the season, as we are already showing our guests that Target will offer unique holiday merchandise and experiences that you can't find anywhere else.","With that, I will turn the call over to John for his comments. John?","John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier, a key priority of our work and operations is based on the goal to provide new and reliable fulfillment options for our guests. As of today, we have multiple new fulfillment options that are in some phase of testing or rollout across our network. We offer in-store pickup of digital orders, available in all of our store locations. We have a Drive Up service which we just began testing at 50 locations in the Twin Cities. We now have same-day delivery which we're testing at four stores in New York City. We offer next-day delivery through Target Restock, which is now available for 90 million guests in 11 markets. And we have a ship-from-store capability which is now in more than 1,400 of our locations.","Of those five fulfillment options, only two were available as we entered the year, in-store pickup and ship-from-store. And while both of those options are relatively mature, we continue to increase the amount of our digital volume handled by our stores. Today, the stores are already fulfilling more than half of our total digital volume through the pickup and ship-from-store capabilities, and that will peak at well above 80% in the days leading up to Christmas. In fact, our stores are planning to ship over 30 million units related to digital orders in the peak four weeks of the holiday season, up from about 18 million units last year.","Among the new fulfillment capabilities we've launched this year, Target Restock has been ramping up quickly. During the third quarter, we rolled out this service to an additional 10 markets across the country. We also extended the deadline for next-day delivery to 7 PM and expanded the number of eligible items to more than 15,000. The average value of a Restock order is about 50% larger than an average store transaction and we're pleased that our stores have been able to fill these orders reliably and efficiently.","Another capability we've just begun rolling out this year is same-day delivery, which we are now offering at four stores in the New York City market. For a small fee, typically between $5 and $10 depending on the address, guests can leave their basket with us at check out and arrange for delivery later the same day in a time window of their choosing. Guests in these stores are enthusiastically responding to this service. Basket sizes for delivery transactions are running six to nine times the average transaction across the four stores that have the service. And our home category continues to account for more than half of the total sales on these delivery orders.","And finally, our new Drive Up capability is in the earliest stage of testing. We rolled out this service to 50 stores in the Twin Cities in the third quarter and we're pleased with the early results. Specifically, guest survey scores for this service are running well ahead of goal, and the stores are outperforming our goal for average wait time. Last week, we began offering this service at our next-generation store in Houston.","As we look ahead to next year, we'll continue scaling all of our new fulfillment capabilities, including same-day and next-day delivery. Our ultimate goal is to build a supply chain that can reliably deliver any item in our network to all but the most remote areas in the U.S. in two days or less, with most items delivered in one day. While a large percentage of our digital orders today are already arriving that quickly, we have more work to do before we can reliably deliver in that timeframe across all of our assortment.","To achieve this goal and to be able to scale all these new fulfillment capabilities, we need to improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of our entire supply chain, from end to end. While we have already made progress on all of these measures, we still have a lot more to do and our new flow center in Perth Amboy, New Jersey will help us get there. We added this building to our network, not because we needed the capacity, but because it will allow our team to learn in a separate facility without the distraction of operating in tandem with the rest of our operations. It's managed by a very lean team that operates like a startup, rapidly building solutions from scratch and iterating as they learn. They run their operations with all new systems and processes developed in-house, including their inventory planning system, order management system, warehouse management system and transportation.","This facility is now serving five of our new small format stores in New York City, which allows them to test these new systems under the most extreme conditions. Specifically, these stores generate very high sales per square foot and have little to nonexistent backroom storage space. As a result, they require rapid replenishment. In fact, our new Herald Square and Tribeca locations are receiving multiple shipments a day from this facility.","When these stores receive merchandise, they don't have the room or the time to unpack and store anything more than they need. To address this constraint, the Perth Amboy facility packs custom shipments for each store which are delivered in bins organized by aisle of the store. As a result, these stores can rapidly move deliveries right on to the sales floors and quickly replenish shelves from the pre-sorted bins. This minimizes the amount of store labor devoted to replenishment allowing the team to devote more of their time to serving their guests. Once the new process reaches a higher level of maturity, we'll be able to scale up within the facility, incorporate automation into the process and begin replicating this model elsewhere in the network.","So now, while I hope it's clear that fulfillment and speed are huge areas of focus for the operations team, I want to be clear that's not our only priority. We are also investing to reach guests in new neighborhoods and elevate the experience in all of our stores. To reach new densely populated neighborhoods, we've completely changed our approach to choosing the location for our small format stores. In the past, we had a relatively rigid prototype for a store's size and layout, and our real estate team focused on finding sites that would accommodate that prototype. Today, when we find space available in an attractive neighborhood, we custom design a store that can fit the available space. These stores generate high sales productivity and higher-than-average gross margin rates, driving strong returns on investment. And for the smaller group of these stores that have now been operating for more than a year, we continue to see very healthy growth in both traffic and comparable sales.","Beyond new stores, our team is quickly scaling up their ability to remodel existing locations, as we're rapidly growing the program from fewer than 30 stores in 2016 to more than 325 next year. Like our new small stores, we apply a custom approach to our remodel projects based on condition of each store and characteristics of the neighborhood. In all cases, when we remodel a store, we focus on convenience, including the incorporation of self-checkout and a separate area for store pickup. And we upgrade the shopping experience for our guests, incorporating more across merchandising opportunities. We carefully measure the financial performance of our remodeled stores, and we continue to see an average sales acceleration of 2% to 4%, right in line with our goals for the program.","But beyond our investments in the physical shopping environment, we're investing in our team and our stores. We're investing in more hours in training to elevate the level of service our teams can provide. We're also changing our operating model, creating specialized teams responsible for specific categories so they can become category experts who can better assist our guests.","And finally, we're investing in wages so we can continue to recruit and retain an outstanding team, a team that will continue to differentiate Target from our competitors. The strength of our team was evident as we rolled out four new brands in our stores in the third quarter. Our team presented these new brands better than we ever have before playing a key role in their early success. This has been an amazing year of change for our operations team. We're moving faster and thinking bigger than we ever have before, as we create and implement plans to modernize nearly everything we do.","So while I want to stress that our future focus isn't slowing down, I also want to make it clear that everyone across our team is laser focused on serving our guests during the holiday season. I want to thank the team for all their efforts to prepare for the season and for all their upcoming hard work during our busiest time of the year. Our team is the reason Target is a special brand and a great place to work.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark who will provide more detail on our third quarter performance and our holiday plans and merchandising. Mark?","Mark J. Tritton - Target Corp.","Thanks, John. Going into this year, two of our highest strategic priorities in merchandising were: first, to invest in our exclusive own brand portfolio to further reinforce our differentiated positioning in the market; and second, strengthening Target's value proposition and positioning making sure we're priced right daily every day which would reinforce with thoughtful, meaningful promotions that resonate with our guests and support our brand.","As Brian highlighted earlier, we're encouraged by our progress on both priorities. In the third quarter alone, we launched four more new and exclusive own brands across apparel and accessories and in home which we then followed at the start of the fourth quarter with the blockbuster launch of Hearth and Hand with Magnolia. With this portfolio that we've rolled out this year, we are presenting our guests with new ideas and items across eight new and exclusive own brands in readiness for the holiday season to create a unique differentiated offer that builds preference for our guests to choose Target.","Beyond the immediate strong sales growth that we've seen from these new brands, consumer survey show they are contributing to the Target brand overall. Specifically, consumer scores for Target differentiation have recently risen to a 10-year high, which will provide a benefit to traffic and sales in all of our categories over time, much like we saw when we launched Cat & Jack.","To reinforce our value proposition with guests this year, our team has also moved at a rapid pace and the response from our guests has exceeded our expectations. Specifically, we've seen a multibillion-dollar increase in sales at regular price so far this year, more than offsetting the decline in sales on discount. This clearly demonstrates that guests are increasingly confident that Target is priced right daily and are not only relying on promotions to get a great deal.","Supported by our Run and Done marketing campaign, confidence in our pricing has driven a rapid increase in quick and fill-in trips which you can see by that traffic and basket trends. As we look back at our third quarter results from a category and market share perspective, we are driving strong relative performance in our discretionary categories. And while we're seeing steady improvement in frequency categories, these areas are facing some near-term headwinds from this year's investment to be priced right every day. As a result of this effort, which was completed late in the third quarter, we're seeing stronger unit share improvements in many frequency categories compared with dollar share. This is an important positive leading indicator for future dollar gains in these categories which is only reinforced by our positive traffic trends.","Across our five broad merchandising categories, hardlines led the way in the third quarter with a strong single-digit comp increase. This growth was driven by continued double-digit comp growth in electronics benefiting from newness, particularly in the video game and mobile segments.","Our home category also saw a healthy comp increase in the third quarter led by the successful launch of our new exclusive Project 62 own brand along with the continued benefit from the consumer trend of spending on their homes.","In apparel and accessories, we gained strong share for the quarter in a space which consumer spending in the overall market is currently declining. Despite lean inventories in the first half of the quarter as we got ready to replace brands and unusually warm weather across most of the country during the bulk of the quarter, our overall comp was down only slightly. But following the launch of each of our three new exclusive apparel and accessory own brands mid-quarter, A New Day in women's, Goodfellow & Co in men's and Joy Lab in activewear, we generated strong sales and traffic results, and we saw even more market improvement when colder weather finally arrived near the end of the quarter.","Third quarter comp sales in food and beverage were up slightly despite a continued headwind from deflation in several categories, combined with adjustments from our own work on pricing. We continue to measure steady progress in food and beverage and most encouragingly, we're seeing the strongest results where we've been investing. This is best evidenced in produce where we've been investing in freshness, organics, in-stocks and specialized store labor where we saw a high-single digit comp increase in the quarter. Adult beverage also continued its strength where we saw continued double-digit comp growth, reflecting our work on assortment and in-store presentation across the country.","And lastly, in essentials, we saw a slight comp decline in the third quarter. Now, this area more than any other area has seen the most change from our work on price and value. And as I mentioned upfront, because we're seeing much stronger unit share and trip growth in this category, we are very confident that this year's work will set us up for stronger performance over time.","One further highlight was in beauty, which has continued to gain market share. This category is benefiting from our investments to differentiate both the assortment and the store service model, as we focus on emerging trends and first-to-market brand launches, supported by an increasing number of dedicated beauty experts in our store who are available from open to close, all delivered at an unbelievable value.","Before I look ahead to the holidays, our third quarter review wouldn't be complete without a recap of our key seasons. In back-to-school, we added to our long record of logging comp growth year after year, and we saw the strongest result in kids apparel and supplies. In back-to-college, we benefited from positive results in electronics, reflecting all of the newness I mentioned earlier. In Halloween, we saw our strongest share results in the early part of the season as the final late-season positive sales surge moved further into the fourth quarter based on the timing of the holiday relative to our fiscal calendar.","As we look ahead to this year's holiday season, we have made significant strategic changes to the quality and level of our inventory position. Our teams have reduced unproductive inventory which has created room across our network for all the newness we are now delivering. As we ended the third quarter, we planned for our inventory position to be higher than a year ago, reflecting specific early intentional investments to support the launches of new items in electronics along with inventory to support Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, which launched at the beginning of the fourth quarter.","Speaking of Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, we're really pleased with the initial results from the launch, which has set the perfect tone for the holidays. The collection, which was co-created with our friends, Chip and Joanna Gaines, features more than 300 items in tabletop, home d\u00e9cor and giftables, most for under $30. On the day the collaboration debuted, guests were shopping online in the early hours and lining up outside our stores across the country. And based on early demand, we're implementing our inventory contingency plans to quickly replenish items that are already selling through.","Also new for the holidays this year, we've made a meaningful investment in our gifting program, which features more than 1,700 items curated for women, men, kids and teens. Most of the items are exclusive to Target and priced under $15, and they'll be displayed prominently in both our stores and online to make it even more easy and convenient for our guests to find the right gift this season.","And, of course, we'll be offering great deals on a huge assortment of new and innovative items across our entertainment, electronics and toy categories. In toys, we've added more than 1,400 new and exclusive items this year from sought-after national specialty and owned brands. This season, we'll also be featuring more than 70 exclusive board games, building on the continued strength in this category that we've seen all year.","In electronics, we'll be featuring new and in-demand consoles across software including the Nintendo Switch and Super Mario Odyssey game, along with a Target-exclusive Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle. This season will also feature a focus on a much broader assortment of voice-activated speakers, like Google Home, with an expanded assortment of wearable technology and accessories, and as always, we'll offer a full line of Apple products highlighting all of the recent launches.","In entertainment, we'll continue to highlight Taylor Swift's new album, Reputation, which features two exclusive collectible magazines available only at Target. This album broke the record for the number of preorders in advance of its launch last week, and we've continued to see strong demand in sales since the debut.","Throughout the holiday season, we'll continue to offer outstanding value to our guests with meaningful deals on the items that they want the most. New this year, we've introduced Weekend Deals, which features marquee prices on new items every weekend based on what we know guests are looking for at different times throughout the season.","In addition, we'll continue to offer our regular cadence for our weekly ad and Cartwheel offers and we'll offer some of our lowest prices of the year during big events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. All of these deals are designed to reinforce the work we've done all year to show guests that we are priced right daily, and we'll continue to highlight our new lower prices with signage in our stores and online.","So I hope it's clear that we feel really well-positioned as we enter our peak season. Everything we've planned for this year will reinforce for our guests why they love Target during the holidays. By offering unprecedented newness, convenience and meaningful deals, all wrapped up with uniquely Target marketing campaigns that remind guests of the universal joy that comes from togetherness in the season.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy who will provide more detail on our third quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?","Catherine R. Smith - Target Corp.","Thanks, Mark. Consistent with the second quarter, our third quarter traffic, comparable sales and overall financial performance were all stronger than our expectations. Third-quarter comparable sales increased 0.9%, driven by a traffic increase of 1.4%, both of these numbers decelerated sequentially as we faced a tougher prior-year comparison. However, on a two-year stacked basis, both traffic and comp sales accelerated in the third quarter.","Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.91 was near the upper end of our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.95. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.87, $0.04 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by the net effect of two offsetting factors. The primary impact was a $123 million pre-tax charge related to our October debt repurchase which lowered GAAP EPS from continuing operations by $0.14. This was largely offset by a $0.10 positive impact related to income tax matters. The majority of this $0.10 benefit was driven by a decrease in our 2016 net taxes related to our global sourcing operations. The remaining benefit was related to the favorable resolution of other income tax matters in the quarter.","One other note on our third quarter tax expense, in addition to the matters we've excluded from adjusted EPS, third quarter adjusted and GAAP EPS from continuing operations reflect a $0.03 benefit from our global sourcing operations related to our 2017 taxes.","Our third quarter gross margin rate of 29.7% was down about 10 basis points from last year. This decline reflects continued pressure from digital fulfillment and our work on pricing and promotions, mostly offset by our cost control efforts. Merchandise mix had a roughly neutral impact on our third quarter gross margin rates, as healthy performance in higher margin categories was balanced by strength in hardlines.","Our third quarter SG&A expense rate of 21.1% was about 80 basis points higher than last year. This increase was primarily driven by compensation expense, reflecting a year-over-year increase in team member incentives combined with the impact of investments in store hours and wage rates. This was partially offset by the timing of some expenses and our cost-saving efforts.","The third quarter depreciation and amortization line was about $70 million higher than last year. This increase reflects the impact of accelerated depreciation related to next year's remodel program, which will transform about three times as many stores compared with this year. We recently finalized our specific store remodel plans for next year and subsequently refined our D&A forecast by quarter. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we expect a similar or somewhat smaller year-over-year increase in the D&A expense line than we just experienced in the third quarter. And as we look ahead to 2018, our current view is that quarterly D&A will be about $80 million higher than 2017 in each of the first three quarters next year, reflecting the continued recognition of accelerated depreciation on next year's much larger group of remodels.","At the end of the third quarter, our inventory was a little more than 5% higher than last year. This represents a change from the trend we've seen in recent quarters in which our inventory has declined even as we've maintained a strong in-stock position. This quarter's increase reflects a year-over-year change in the timing of our holiday season inventory. One area that has increased is electronics in which the team has made early intentional investments in new and innovative items in the video game and mobile categories.","We expect our inventory will be roughly flat to last year by the end of the fourth quarter. Over the longer term, we continue to believe we have a meaningful opportunity to increase inventory turnover as we work to speed up our supply chain. And in the near term, we believe recent favorability and payables leverage will continue into next year, providing a benefit to working capital and cash flow from operations.","Our business continues to return a lot of cash. Specifically, we generated $1.5 billion of cash from operations in the third quarter. In keeping with our goals and guidance for the year, we devoted more than $800 million of capital investment to our business this quarter bringing our year-to-date totals to just over $2 billion. In addition, we returned $339 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and another $171 million through share repurchase.","Regarding the balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier, we invested $463 million to repurchase high coupon debt in the quarter, which was offset by the issuance of $750 million of 30-year debt at very favorable rates. In January, we have $1.1 billion in debt maturing which we expect to retire with cash.","Now let's look ahead to our expectations for fourth quarter and full year financial performance. As I have mentioned all year, we continue to plan prudently while developing the agility to adjust to changing conditions and market opportunities. And while I hope we've shown today that we have outstanding plans going into the holiday season, we enter every holiday season knowing that it will be highly competitive and promotional.","Putting all of those considerations together, we believe that Target is positioned to deliver comparable sales of flat or better in the fourth quarter with an upside potential for a 2% comp increase. We expect to see continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting the cost of digital fulfillment combined with the impact of our work to ensure we are priced right daily for our guests.","Our SG&A outlook reflects thoughtful investments in our team and in our stores to support outstanding service for our guests during the peak holiday season. Combined with the pressure on D&A I outlined earlier, we expect EBIT will be about $290 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. This performance translates to an expectation for both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.25 in the fourth quarter.","Adding this expectation to our actual performance through the first three quarters, you will see that our expected range for full year adjusted EPS is now $4.40 to $4.60. This is $0.06 higher than our guidance three months ago and $0.50 higher than our expectation going into the year. Regarding full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations, we expect a range of $4.38 to $4.58, $0.02 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by the net impact of debt retirement cost and tax benefits we recognize throughout the year.","One other note, both our fourth quarter and full year expectations include the recognition of a 53rd accounting week this year, consistent with many other retailers. As we said before, this week is somewhat smaller than an average week in the year, at about $1 billion in sales. From an operating margin standpoint, for that week, we expect to see gross margin and SG&A rates relatively similar to our annual averages. In addition, we will benefit from leverage on D&A that week as that expense is recognized on an annual basis.","And one final note, given that the holiday season plays such an important role in our fourth quarter performance, we announced today that we plan to issue a post-holiday season financial update on Tuesday, January 9.","As Brian mentioned earlier, the underlying health of our business and its strong cash flow have enabled the investments that are moving our business forward today. As we look ahead to the next few years, we're planning for continued investments in our business in new and remodeled stores, our supply-chain, technology, unique brands and importantly, in our team. The good news is that our business can sustain those investments while generating enough cash to support our dividend and, when we have room within our debt ratings, share repurchase.","We entered the year with the confidence that we're making the right long-term investments in our business, and our results this year have only reinforced that confidence. As we look ahead, we expect to have ample capacity to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders allowing us to grow into an even stronger company.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Brian for some final remarks.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Thanks, Cathy. We're going to quickly move to your questions, but I wanted to add one final note first. We are planning to host our Spring 2018 Financial Community Meeting here in Minneapolis on March 5 and 6. John Hulbert will send out more details in January, but for now, we wanted to let you know the dates so you can hold them on your calendar. We'll be scheduling the meeting to allow attendees to arrive on the afternoon of the 5th and you'll be able to return home before the end of the day on the 6th. We hope to see you at that meeting. So, with that, we will conclude our prepared remarks.","Now, John, Mark, Cathy and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. David Schick from Consumer Edge Research, you may go ahead.","David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned several times throughout the call, and frankly throughout the year, that you are trying to take a conservative approach to planning, but you also mentioned \u2013 and you also mentioned the strength and the confidence you have as this quarter \u2013 that you just reported in the prior quarter happened in the traffic and the merchandising. Can you sort of square that circle for us? Because the shares are obviously reacting to guidance this morning, so help us frame conservatism versus confidence.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","David, thank you and good morning. I think sitting here today, we feel very confident that we're making very good progress against the plans that we set out earlier this year. If I think about the state of our business today, we're seeing a great response to the eight new brands that we've launched. As we've remodeled now over 100 stores, we continue to see the lift that we were projecting up 2% to 4%. We've seen a tremendous response to our new small formats that we've been opening up in new neighborhoods and on college campuses. And as you know, we opened up a number of new stores in this last quarter. And whether it was the results we've seen in Herald Square or all the way out in Hawaii, the guest has responded very, very well.","We continue to see very strong performance from a digital standpoint, outpacing the industry by a 2x factor. And during the quarter again, we saw very strong digital growth, and that's been underpinned by the progress we've made from a digital fulfillment standpoint and some of the things that John talked about during his prepared remarks. So sitting here today, I think we're making great progress, and I think we'll continue to see that progress extend into the fourth quarter.","So we entered the quarter with a lot of confidence. We know there's a lot of business that has to be done and we're off to a very good start led by the reaction to Hearth and Hand, as well as in the other initiatives that are in place. So I think we're taking the right approach, but we entered the quarter with a lot of confidence and making a lot of progress against literally every initiative that we've set forth earlier this year.","David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Just to sort of follow up to that, is there any \u2013 what would be the \u2013 do you expect to backslide against any traction in key variables, comp, gross profit dollar comp? Help us understand that with this confidence in the guide.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","David, we don't expect to see any deterioration in the progress that we've been making throughout the year. So, again, I think we enter the fourth quarter highly confident and a very strong position with our stores performing incredibly well. Great merchandise, a terrific marketing campaign, great digital capabilities and an expanded suite of digital fulfillment capability. So we feel very good about how the entire business is set to perform in the fourth quarter.","David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you so much.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Peter Benedict from Baird, you may go ahead.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Oh, hi. Thanks, guys. So just on price perception, the work you've been doing, I mean, it sounds like you're pleased with where you've gotten that now at the end of third quarter. Just \u2013 I mean, do you think that that's an ongoing process that you're going to have to do? How are you \u2013 you mentioned some of the measurements you're using on that, but just trying to understand is that something you let ride here for the fourth quarter and then reassess where you are next year, or do you feel like you've gotten yourself to a spot where there's going to be no further adjustments required?","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Peter, I think Mark and his team have made tremendous progress over the course of the year. And as we've talked about a number of times now, we're seeing a significant shift of our business towards everyday regular price which is really important over the long term. So we're going to continue to make sure that we're committed to offering great value, that we're priced right daily. And during the fourth quarter, we'll provide exciting promotions to support those items that we know our guests are going to be interested in shopping for at Target. So it's an ongoing commitment. We want to make sure we deliver great value across the seasons and we're going to make sure that we couple that with exciting promotions in the fourth quarter.","David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then one maybe follow up for John, you talked about a lot of the fulfillment options that you guys are working on. Help us through how does that impact the store labor model as you see kind of going forward? And within that, the $15 minimum wage plan, I understand that's not a \u2013 it's not a fourth quarter question, it's more just as we look out the next few years, how do you see that \u2013 those having an impact on the labor? Thank you.","John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.","Well, I think clearly as we do more fulfillment out of the store, we will add labor to support that. I think we've said since February, we're going to invest in the labor in our stores, invest in training, invest in having experts in the store, invest in having people on the sales floor and changing the operating model for those stores. So that's an important part of what we're doing. Almost separately and independently, we're building teams that \u2013 so that we don't take hours away from everything else we're doing that are handling the fulfillment in the backroom.","So it's really a question of the operating model in the store that's evolving. And we feel really good about utilizing the stores that are the closest, fastest and cheapest way to get merchandise to our guests. They have significant capabilities now. We're doing same day, next day, two day, pickup, Drive Up, all kinds of ways to meet the guests' needs, and I think that's the important factor, all centered around using the store as the hub. And we think it's a highly efficient way to use our assets and we have great teams that can meet the capabilities that we need for our guests.","David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Peter, thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. So I guess my first question really is around the fourth quarter and the comparisons that you were facing last year. So in-store comps were particularly soft, gross margin was down a lot, there was issues around digital fulfillment. I guess \u2013 you talk about the underlying momentum of the business not stalling at all, but can you talk about how you expect to cycle those issues from last year?","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Ed, again, as we enter this season, I think we're in a much stronger position. John underscored the fact that we've got an expanded array of digital fulfillment capabilities. Mark's talked about the progress we've made from both a brand standpoint, but also a value standpoint. I think we continue to enhance our digital capabilities. So I think we enter this season in a much stronger position. And I think what's really important to recognize is the investments we've made in our team and our stores puts us in a very strong position as we enter the fourth quarter.","So I feel great about the investments we've made in wages, in hours, in seasonal hiring, and I think our stores are going to drive both our digital business and our store business throughout the fourth quarter. So I think we enter the season in a very different position versus last year. And I think that's reflected in the start that we've seen to the season and the approach we're taking throughout the fourth quarter.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","Okay. And second question for you, I just want to \u2013 I know you don't want to give guidance for next year, but I was hoping that maybe you could talk about the puts and the takes in terms of what we should be thinking about, areas that you could see outsized investment. D&A is going to be a headwind next year, wages clearly seem like they'll be a headwind, your thoughts on price investments from here. The Street's sort of looking for a modest decline in earnings. Seems like something like that \u2013 larger than that's possible. I just \u2013 I don't know how much at this point, Brian, you can help with that, but I think it is an area that we're all sort of wrestling with.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Well, Ed, we're hopeful that you'll join us in March for next year's Financial Community Day. Obviously, we're not going to provide 2018 guidance today. But I'll give you a preview. You're going to hear us talk about many of the same things we've been talking about this year: Our commitment to the store experience and continuing to remodel stores across the country. Our commitment to opening up new small formats in new neighborhoods and on college campuses. Our continued commitment to digital. Our commitment to enhancing our fulfillment capabilities. Our continued commitment to new brands and building our proprietary fleet of brands, and an ongoing commitment to value. And all of that will be underscored by our commitment to our team.","So we'll go through that in much more detail in March. But as a preview, we're going to be talking about the exact same suite of initiatives next year that we've been talking about this year. We feel great about the progress. Our strategy is working. Each one of those initiatives is on track or ahead of schedule, and we expect to accelerate those initiatives in 2018.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Chris Horvers from JPMorgan, you may go ahead.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. So first, can you talk about how the essentials category \u2013 it was down slightly. You mentioned more share being taken on the unit side. Can you talk about unit growth in essentials and how that's progressed over the past couple of quarters as you've put more muscle behind the price investments?","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Sure. Chris, why don't we let Mark walk you through how we're approaching our investments in essentials.","Mark J. Tritton - Target Corp.","Hi, Chris. Yeah, let me share with you. So we've been sharing this year that we took a journey in terms of ensuring we were priced right daily and that we were able to create and communicate to our guests the right value, and that started in April of this year and we completed that through the end of the third quarter. What we've seen with that is, we had an expectation that that's not an immediate (49:01) response we need to build, ongoing deeper trust with the guests and get them to connect with that priced right daily ethos and we've seen a really fast reaction, a positive reaction to that.","So we're creating in trips and traffic with our adjustment on \u2013 to be priced right daily. And as a result, we're seeing an increase in our unit velocity and we fully expected and banked in some of the short-term sales deflation that we would see as a result. But we're starting to see that equal out and we expect that stability to continue through the fourth quarter and into 2018.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, I think in the second quarter, I think essentials was up slightly. So did it \u2013 was it essentially that the price investment accelerated and the unit velocity maintained or \u2013 maintain its positive trajectory or did it accelerate?","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Yeah. Chris, I think that's exactly what we're seeing, continued investment across multiple categories. And as Mark talked about, the first thing we see is an increase in units, an increase in trips and ultimately that's going to drive positive comps over time. So, I think the efforts are paying off relatively quickly and we feel really good about the guest response.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Have a great holiday.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. You may go ahead.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Hey, Bob.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just had two questions. Good morning. The first one is on in-stocks or out-of-stocks, you look at the inventory levels that Cathy talked about, are you seeing the in-stock levels where you'd like them at this point? And then the second question that I have is around fulfillment costs, when you look at \u2013 I think you said \u2013 I think John said stores are fulfilling more than 50% of digital, peak at 80%. When you think about the fourth quarter and the costs around that increased fulfillment of digital by the stores, is it a one-for-one basis in terms of the level of increases there?","John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.","I'll start with the in-stock question. I think, Bob, we talked about in-stocks last year in February. It's a journey for us. We know, I think we've made a lot of progress in in-stocks given our current capabilities, but we also said in order to really solve the problem, we need to fix some fundamental capabilities in our supply chain around speed, reliability, inventory placement, and that's where we are on the journey.","So, the inventory increase at the end of Q3, as Mark said, more related to us being sure we're ready for the fourth quarter in categories like electronics, Hearth and Hand, where we took positions, intentional inventory positions, to increase inventories in advance of the fourth quarter, less to do with our management of day-to-day in-stocks\/out-of-stocks. We continue to work on those. And as I said, there's the short term working within our current capabilities and then the longer term solve that comes as we continue to improve our overall supply chain capabilities.","Your second question, I'm not entirely clear, Bob, on where you're going. Maybe you could clarify how fulfill \u2013 your question, the store labor related to fulfillment, I'm not \u2013 I didn't quite understand it.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Sorry. Just from the perspective of the expense levels, like the pressure that you saw in the third quarter versus the expectation of the pressure fulfilling more than 80% in the stores on the expense line, specifically.","John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.","Yeah. I wouldn't compare to third quarter. Compared to last year, we are doing more fulfillment in-store. As we said, we think that's the most cost-effective way given the total P&L, so shipping plus store labor, we think that's the most cost-effective way to do it. Compared to last year, we saw significant spikes last year near the end of the quarter, approaching 80% fulfillment. And I would say, when we get into that 80% range what really goes up is store pickup, and we'll take that model all day long, highly efficient for us, highly profitable from a digital perspective. So, when our mix gets that high in-store, we actually like the economics a lot.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you so much. Good morning. I have got two questions, and my first relates to gross margin. Just to revisit, the fact that you do have this very depressed compare from a year ago and you're actually entering Q4 with pretty good gross margin momentum, down only very nominally in Q3 as some of your new brands are really starting to get traction. So, is your thinking on the expectation of a declining gross margin simply a factor of more business being done online each year and the cost of fulfillment associated with that, or are some of the new fulfillment options that you're introducing just somewhat more costly and you're giving yourself rooms to absorb that pressure?","Catherine R. Smith - Target Corp.","Good morning, Matt. This is Cathy.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi.","Catherine R. Smith - Target Corp.","I think I would look about it the way we always \u2013 we have all year approaching it, which is we're trying to be prudent as we plan into the fourth quarter. We're excited about what we've seen so far, but it's early in a very important quarter.","The pressure that we are anticipating is around digital fulfillment, as well as all the work we continue to do around value. And we're offsetting that with cost savings continuing into the fourth quarter. So I would look at it as just doing what we said we would do all year long, which is be prudent, plan appropriately, and make sure that we set the business up for success.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Yes, Matt, I'd only build on a couple of the comments that Cathy made: One, we feel very good about the performance of our owned brands, and from a gross margin standpoint, both short term and long-term, that's going to be very beneficial to our mix. Two, we are clearly investing in digital and digital capabilities, and expect that we're going to continue to see strong digital growth in the fourth quarter.","So it is the mix of our business that really makes sure that our gross margin returns stay on track. But the work that Mark and his team have done with our owned brands and the results that we're seeing across our eight new brands is very beneficial both short term and long term to our gross margin rate performance.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's super helpful. The quick follow-up relates to REDcard penetration. So we noted that the year-on-year penetration seems to have stabilized this quarter after having shown some increases for a period of time. Anything to glean from the stabilization of that trend?","Catherine R. Smith - Target Corp.","We are really excited about some of the capabilities we're adding to REDcard coming into this fourth quarter. I have to tell you, I'm one of the early users for our wallet application, and it is phenomenally fast and convenient and great experience for the guests. So as we've continued to ramp up some exclusives around REDcard, our guests are responding. We're seeing additional capabilities come into REDcard holders, our best guests into the fourth quarter, so I would expect that we'll see that trend continuing to be favorable.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Yeah. Matt, I think we also recognize that as a byproduct of the investments we've been making in our stores, our brands, moving into new neighborhoods, we're bringing in new guests to Target. So over time, we certainly want to convert them to REDcard holders. But I think what we're seeing is, as we move into new catchments, these are new guests that are shopping at Target. Over time, they'll start adapting to our REDcard. I think our new brands are bringing new guests into our stores, and I think the focus that we've placed around value is also attracting a new shopper.","So over time, that provides us tremendous opportunities to continue to build REDcard penetration. And one of the metrics that we haven't talked about on the call is the fact that traffic was up 1.4%. And that's existing guests shopping more often, but it also is new guests coming to our stores and our site. So over time, those are potential new prospects for our REDcard, and we certainly expect to see that conversion as we go into 2018.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you so much, guys.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you may go ahead.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thanks. Just two quick questions. Just on the fourth quarter, the sort of the breadth of the range there, can you just give us the scenarios, like sort of what brings you to the low-end of the fourth quarter range, the $1.05 versus the $1.25?","And the other question I had was just I was wondering if you would share some of the early results on the pickup customer versus the Drive Up customer, which is better, whose basket is bigger, how much bigger is the basket versus the store shopper or just plain online shopper that gets shipped to home? Anything you can share about the metrics and what you're excited about there? Thanks.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Robby, why don't we let John start by talking about that pickup shopper, and then we'll come back to our guidance for the quarter?","John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.","I might start with the Drive Up shopper there. I think our guest survey scores there, NPS scores, are frankly off the charts. We see a high utility. It's mom with two kids in the back, it's our core Target shopper who just doesn't \u2013 it's raining outside and doesn't want to get out of the car. So we've seen very, very high scores there.","The baskets are mixed, as you'd imagine, right? Sometimes they're larger, sometimes it's I need one thing. And the same is very true for pickup in-store, driven by \u2013 it can be driven by promotional cadence, it can be driven by convenience. There's lots of different reasons people choose that option, and so the basket varies. There's nothing really to glean from that other than for both of them we see very high NPS scores for our guests which is the most important thing from our perspective.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Robby, why don't I clear up the question around guidance for the quarter, and really I'll focus on the full year. I think our fourth quarter guidance is a reflection of the performance we've been delivering throughout the year. And I'll go back and note, as Cathy discussed, our full year guidance is up $0.50. Now, I'll do the math for you. That's $500 million of improvement versus our original guidance. So we certainly approach the fourth quarter with a level of balance and conservatism, but feel good about the momentum that we have and we think the performance we've been delivering throughout the year will be reflected in our fourth quarter.","So we feel confident, we're making good progress. There's a lot of business still to be done in the fourth quarter, and I think our range of comp of flat to 2% and the approach we're taking from an EPS standpoint just reflects the approach we've been taking throughout the year.","So with that, I think, operator, we've got time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Kate McShane from Citi, you may go ahead.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My question was around fulfillment as well and a little bit longer term in nature. I had wondered with regards to the Drive Up and the same-day delivery, if there are any early indications of what the limitations might be in terms of where you can introduce that. And then also with regards to the profitability of how those two fulfillment options relate to the ship-from-store.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","Yeah. I'll let John talk about the profitability component, but, Kate, I think one of the great things about our strategy is the important role our stores play. And as we think about Drive Up, we think about same-day, those are going to be enabled by the 1,800 stores that are in neighborhoods around the country. So we should be able to continue to expand that over time and meet the needs of our guests no matter where they live and which store they shop in.","John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.","And on your question about profitability, clearly, the closer we are to the store, the better we like it. When a guest comes in and takes it off the shelf, great. Only slightly disadvantage to that would be pickup or Drive Up because there is one more touch, but really again economically a great, great solution for us. As we get into shipping, same-day delivery is more expensive. There's no question about that. And at least today, our guest research leads us to believe guests understand that. They want it priced right, they want the convenience, and they understand there may be a charge to get it to them at the time they wanted during that day. And we've seen that in the four stores in New York, no pushback at all in the delivery charge.","And we \u2013 the great thing is, we see the baskets, as I said, six to nine times larger, so it ends up being a highly, highly profitable transaction for us. And so there are markets where that will work \u2013 that type of transaction will work really well. There are other markets where, as you said, there'll be standard two-day shipping in there. We're working hard to reduce cost throughout that shipping while improving the speed. And so that's on our team so that the guests get the great service and we make that a great economic transaction for Target as well.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","All right.","John J. Mulligan - Target Corp.","But we feel good about our ability to make all of it work.","Brian C. Cornell - Target Corp.","So with that, operator, that concludes our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I want to thank everybody for participating, and wish everyone a happy holiday season.

Mark will provide detail on recent category performance along with our fourth quarter merchandising and marketing plan, John will provide an update on our efforts to improve operations and modernize our supply chain and finally Cathy will offer more detail on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.","Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.","As a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS from continuing operations and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his comments on the third quarter and our expectations going forward. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with the financial results we announced earlier this morning. While we have much more work to do. This quarter we saw a meaningful progress in our efforts to improve our traffic in sales as both metrics improved by about a percentage point compared with the second quarter.","In addition, we generated much stronger than expected EPS performance, driven by strong signature category growth, favourable results and back-to-school and back-to-college season and the continued benefit of our cost savings efforts.","Our third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.04 was 22.1% higher than last year and well beyond the high end of the guidance range of $0.75 to $0.95. With this outstanding third quarter performance, Targets adjusted EPS has grown more than 10% through the first three quarters of the year. This is particularly strong performance given that we\u2019ve experienced flat, comparable sales growth during this period.","In addition, our business continues to generate very strong after tax returns on invested capital. For the 12-months through the end of the third quarter, we reported a very healthy after tax ROIC of 14.3% excluding the onetime benefit of the gain on the sale of our pharmacy business. This performance represents an increase of approximately 130 basis points from a year ago.","Of course, strong cash generation by our business allows us to continue to fund a healthy level of investments in our stores, supply chain and technology, while funding robust cash returns to our investors.","In the third quarter, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date we\u2019ve already returned over $4 billion to our shareholders. I\u2019d like to pause and thank our team for their boundless energy and passion to serve our guests by offering them unique merchandise, outstanding service and a best-in-class experience. They deserve all the credit for our outstanding financial results this quarter.","As I look ahead, I am really excited about our holiday merchandising and marketing plans, and I\u2019m confident that our outstanding team will bring those plans to life for our guests in our stores and digital channels throughout the holiday season.","Our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress on many of our strategic priorities, reflecting our work on category rolls. Sales and signature categories accelerated in the third quarter, out comping the company average by more than three percentage points.","Signature growth with the key driver behind healthy comp increases in both home and apparel, and we continue to see market share gains in these important categories. Consistent with our recent strength around events and holidays, third-quarter sales in the back-to-school, back-to-college season were very strong, resulting in favorable gross margin mix in our sales.","In addition, our gross margin rate continues to reflect the cost of goods benefits of our ongoing cost control initiatives. Within our signature category results, we're seeing exceptional growth in our two new brands we launched earlier this year, Pillowfort and kids' home and Cat & Jack and kids apparel.","We developed these new brands in collaboration, with both kids and their parents and our guests continue to respond to the unique combination of style, quality and value these new brands deliver. We also continue to see robust growth in our digital sales. Digital sales grew more than 26% in the third quarter and they have grown more than 20% year-to-date.","This year, we have devoted both capital and expense to improve the digital experience, increase reliability and create additional capacity, and we're seeing really encouraging results. This quarter we ran a promotion in that among other things, the lattices [ph] stress test or systems in advance of the fourth quarter.","This promotion was an unprecedented and compelling offer for our guests, 10% off on our entire assortment in both stores and digital channels. As you'd expect the offer drove strong traffic and sales in all channels, but our digital comp and the day was particularly high.","In the face of very strong surge in traffic, I'm happy to report that our system performed very well providing us valuable insight as we prepare for even bigger days this holiday season. Last year to support our strategic investments and Targets digital capabilities, supply chain and store experience, we launched a comprehensive cost-savings efforts to free up resources and create capacity, and our team has really delivered.","We had an ambitious goal to take a total of two billion out of Targets expenses and costs of goods over two-year period, yet as we approach the end of that two-year period, I am pleased that our team has actually exceeded our $2 billion goal and importantly, the team has identified additional opportunities will pursue in future years. The ability to create additional capacity is critical, given the sizable investment we continue to make as we position our business for long term growth.","Finally, we are really excited about the continued and strong performance of our new flexible format stores. These new locations allows to reach new neighborhoods in dense urban and suburban markets. We opened another five of these stores across the country in the third quarter, including our fantastic new store in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City.","When we opened an operating stores, we go beyond legacy systems and processes, customizing the assortment and operations such as the characteristics of the individual neighborhoods in which we operate and we continue to see phenomenal response from our guests, including this quarters openings. We are now operating nearly 30 of these new format stores.","Based on their performance, we are increasingly confident and the opportunity for Target to profitably operate hundreds of urban and flex format stores over time, reaching new neighborhoods where consumers have a strong affinity for our brand.","As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, we are continuing to address the challenges I described on our last conference call, first and foremost is traffic. And while we saw a considerable improvement this quarter, we are committed to growing our comp [ph] traffic and sales overtime.","A key factor is our ability to deliver on both sides of our expect more, pay less brand promise, and our signature category performance demonstrates that we continue to deliver on the expect more size. However, earlier this year we began to fall short in communicating value to support the payless side, both in our stores and in our marketing.","In the third quarter, we began to address that imbalance by communicating our commitment to value more clearly. We believe those changes were instrumental in driving improve traffic and comp sales in the third quarter.","Going forward, we are committed to striking the appropriate balance in all of our marketing communications. We also continued our work to improve the performance of our assortment of convenient, self-service food in our stores. We saw another small decline in food comp sales in the third quarter, reflecting near term challenges presented by deflation, and an intensely competitive environment.","Despite these near-term challenges, we are focused on delivering stronger growth overtime, and Mark will outline his team\u2019s plans in a few minutes. In addition, comp sales in our electronics and entertainment categories continue to underperform the company average, however, in the third quarter, we were encouraged to see a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products driven by their introduction of several new product innovations.","As you know electronics, entertainment, and toys are key gifting categories in the fourth quarter, and the team is excited about their plans to compete and win at this critical time. Finally, we continue to work with CVS to drive script count growth into pharmacies in our stores.","As a result of our coordinated marketing efforts, which include our stores, our weekly ads, and CVS direct communication to their PBM members. We measured an increase in consumer awareness of the transition of our stores, pharmacies, the CVS and we've seen a corresponding improvement in the script trends in these pharmacies. We continue to believe our CVS partnership will be important traffic driver overtime, and we expect to see significant improvement in 2017.","Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to pause and reflect on the progress and the business results for the first three quarters of the year. When you focus on the top line, you'll see that we've generated essentially flat comps through the first nine months of the year, this is well below the expectation we had at the beginning of the year and our first and highest priority is restore growth of the traffic and sales trends. However, when you move to the bottom line, you'll see that we've grown adjusted earnings per share more than 10% in the first nine months of the year. This is outstanding performance, but it's particularly noteworthy in light of the sales challenges we've been facing, the performance is a testament to the resilience of our underlying business, our strategy and of course our team, the best team in retail.","Now I'd like to welcome Mark Tritton onto the call. Mark comes to us with an impressive history and retail merchandising with experience at Nike, Timberland and most recently Nordstrom. Mark is our merchants merchant and a strong leader.","Since he arrived at Target, I've been impressed with how quickly he has become immersed in our business, and integrated into our team. We're excited at Mark leading merchandising and I know he's excited about our plans for the fourth quarter and beyond. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide more details on the category performance in the third quarter and our plans to win during the holiday season and beyond. Mark?","Mark Tritton","Thanks Brian, and hello everyone. I'm so happy to be joining all of you on the call today and look forward to meeting with you in New York this spring. As Brian mentioned, I spent the last several months digging into our business understanding Target strength and exploring what we have the biggest opportunities to grow. And what I found is, it\u2019s a strong business as it stand today a powerful Target brand, an impressive home brand portfolio, great looking stores, a friendly and engaged team, and a huge base of passionate guests.","With these strengths, we also have an amazing opportunity in front of us. It has been energizing to dig in with the team to develop merchandising\u2019s plan to drive Targets future growth. I look forward to sharing our vision in detail -- with their financial community meetings.","For today, I'm going to focus on our recent performance and our plans for this quarter and the holiday seasons. In the third quarter, sales performance improved across nearly every part of our business, comp sales and apparel and home have accelerated the most, providing a positive mix benefit on the gross margin lines. Strong execution and mark down management compounded that benefit leading to much stronger than expected gross margin in the quarter.","As Brian mentioned, we saw very strong trends in back-to-school and back-to-college reflecting our focus on key growth categories and the benefit improvements we made to our promotional cadence, digital growth played a big role in the season, particularly in home which is already one of our biggest and most profitable categories online.","We\u2019ve continued to see the fastest growth in signature category sales. A few of the highlights from the third quarter include kids, we've seen outstanding performance in Cat & Jack and Pillowfort, but also continue to generate strong comp in women's ready-to-wear on top of outstanding growth in 2015. And within home, our results were strongest in the day core and seasonal category.","Given this strong growth in Signature, both home and apparels saw low single-digit growth in comp sales this quarter extending our record of market share gains in these strategically important categories.","As Brian mentioned, the electronics recent product launches helped improve trends in Apple this quarter, however, we continue to see soft trends in mobile phones overall, which is what we've seen in the industry as upgrade cycles are lengthening.","In food and beverage, we saw another small comp sales decline this quarter. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we have an opportunity to more clearly convey and resonate value for our guests in this important category. This is being done through our end cap presentations, enhancing our use of local pricing and making changes to our promotional cadence. And we expect to see the full benefit from these changes in the fourth quarter.","In Essentials, where we identified a few more opportunities, we have seen faster progress as a result come cells grew essentials in the third quarter and we expect to see continued progress this quarter. Also as Brian mentioned before, we've seen a meaningful improvement in script counts in the CVS pharmacies in our stores. We're also seeing higher gift services scores compared with the period prior to and particularly during the conversion of our policy. These improvements show that our guests are moving beyond the temporary disruption caused by those conversions.","And with the disruption behind them, they are responding to the services and capabilities that CVS can provide. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to build on our momentum from the third quarter. Target is a destination for seasons and no season is more important than the holiday.","In home, we're looking to build on last year's success when we saw the biggest comp growth in more than a decade. A holiday Decor assortment will feature products based on three key seasonal trends; Traditional, Nordic and Modern and this year we've created one to shop, a destination in our stores and on target.com that will grab guest attention and put them in the mood to shop for the season.","Wondershop features thousands of new holiday trim items, in fact about 70% of the assortment is new this year, we're also bringing back to the holidays our collaboration with stationary designer sugar paper, which was a big hit last year. This features a limited-edition collection ranging from $1.50 upto $15.","Holiday is an important apparel season for families, and we're well positioned to live it for our guests with a new Cat & Jack collection. This new brand has hit a sweet spot with millennial parents in particular, and we have high expectations for what it can deliver during the holiday season.","Between October and December, we are introducing more than 1,000 new pieces to our Cat & Jack assortment, each piece is under $30 which is unbeatable value when you consider the design and quality. As Brian also shared, toys play a key role in the fourth quarter. In fact, we do about 50% of our annual toy sales during this timeframe and this year we're building on 10 consecutive quarters of growth in toys reflecting our investment in newness, differentiation and collectability.","This holiday season we\u2019ve added nearly 1,800 new and exclusive toys, up more than 15% from last year. As you recall, Target have a number one market in Star Wars last year. This fall, we have once again led the market with launch of our Rogue One assortment and for holiday we are featuring more than 100 new products. Be on Star Wars, Disney Princesses continue to do very well.","Elsa from Frozen remains our top seller, selling more than the other 11 princesses combined and emerging trading board games has been a bright spot for us this year, as families are looking for activities that bring them together. We\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in board games so far this year and we\u2019ve got 50 Target exclusive games this season for you.","In electronics this quarter, we're planning for strong demand for Apple new products, given that pre-order volume was three times higher than last year. We're also expecting a lot of guest\u2019s interest in Virtual Reality along with connected home devices like Google home.","Elevated service in our electronics department is also important to help make shopping in this area a more enjoyable experience for our guests, and drive incremental sales in our stores, so more than 1,500 stores were transitioning from Target mobile reps who are focused only on mobile to Target tip [ph] the scope will include all of electronics. Last year exclusive CD from Adele was a massive hit through the holiday season.","This year, we've got a collaboration with Garth Brooks and we expect it to be huge. Targets 10-disc box set includes Garth\u2019s new album with two exclusive tracks including the much-hyped 25th anniversary edition of \"Friends in Low Places\". By the way Target is the only place you'll ever be able to find that track, the set went on sale for 2999 [ph] on November 11 two weeks before Garth's new album will be available at other retailers.","This year in food and beverage, about 20% of our national brand holiday assortment is exclusive to Target and we\u2019ve more than doubled their assortment of craft beers from last year, going for about 700 to nearly 1,500 options across the country. In our marketing and promotion, we are coordinating everything for our guests, inspiring them with providing ease and convenience during the stressful time of year.","From the one-to-shop to the Wonderlist Gift Guide and the kids wish list app, we're making it easy and fun for guests to find the right gift for everyone on their list. Guests love our 10 days of deals last year, so we're bringing back these popular promotions on the days leading up to and following Black Friday. Based on guest\u2019s insights, we\u2019ve optimized these cadence of deals and simplified office to make them easy to understand.","In addition, we've worked with our stores to streamline guest communication, bring up store teams to serve our guests during the busiest time of the year. And finally, throughout the season our broadcast ads will build excitement for the race of the toy cracker, I'll take on the classic story of The Nutcracker. We will release this new holiday story in two, four minute segment during the world broadcast premiere of Frozen on December 11. Kids of all ages will not want to miss it.","With all this amazing content, I hope you can see where we are so excited about our merchandised promotion and marketing plans for the holiday seasons, however as we all know these plans will only come to life through the work of our operations teams. So now I'm going to turn the call over to John who will outline how his team is prepared to deliver on those plans and provide outstanding service to our guests throughout the holiday seasons, John.","John Mulligan","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. Across every aspect of our operations, we are excited and prepared for the peak holiday season, and as a result of this year's efforts to increase the speed, accuracy and reliability of our network, we are well positioned to deliver great guest service, and a better experience in every channel.","In our stores, we've hired and trained tens of thousands of seasonal team members, who are already serving our guests. Notably, despite the tightest labor market conditions, we've seen in sometime, our hiring and training process went smoothly. In fact, we met our key hiring and training milestones earlier than a year ago.","When guests shop at our stores this holiday season, in addition to great products displays and services, you'll find our in stock position is better than we've ever measured, reflecting improvement across every category we sell, and importantly, we are attaining those in stock levels with lower inventory than a year ago.","Over the last 18 months, we've deliberately invested in our inventory position and key commodity categories. To ensure we remain in stock, and categories where reliability is most important to our guests. However, now that we've annualized these investments, and we're beginning to see the benefit of our work to make our supply chain faster, and more reliable, we\u2019ll be able to deliver outstanding in stocks on a smaller base of inventory over time.","The accuracy of our inventory data is key to our speed and reliability, and we've been investing in our systems and processes to achieve greater accuracy. One example is our implementation of our RFID Technology and a portion of our apparel assortment, which is currently in more than 1,600 of our stores.","In affected categories, overall inventory accuracy has increased dramatically, meaningfully reducing the number of occasions in which we can't physically locate an item. In addition, we've made system changes to optimize replenishment of products that our guests purchase in multiples and made changes to minimum on hand standards and higher volume locations, both of which have dramatically reduced our stocks on effective items. We will continue to test and roll out these enhancements throughout next year","Because of our efforts to eliminate non-guests facing work in our stores, the team is delivering outstanding service to our guests, while delivering efficiency and support of our cost control efforts.","Through the redesign of our in-store replenishment processes and algorithms, we've reduced stores background trips dramatically this year, delivering tens of millions of dollars of payroll savings that we have reinvested in service. Two areas in which we've invested store labor for the store pickup process and our ship from storage capability. Guests love the flexibility of these capabilities all year especially, but especially during the holiday season. Infact, during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, we expect our stores to fulfil more than half of our digital demand.","While this is the third holiday season in which we've offered order pick up in all of our stores, we're planning for volume to grow another 50% from a year ago. Since last year, we've added additional holding capacity to more than 80 of our highest volume pickup locations and we've invested in scheduling tools and additional digital devices to enable high volume locations to deliver fast service, even in peak times, and this year in more than 300 of our highest volume pickup locations, our store team will wear unique shirts and deliver separately branded reusable bags to underscore our commitment to the pickup experience.","Our last year's holiday season, about 460 of our stores were shipping directly to our guests, not more than threefold from about 140 stores in 2014. This year we've extended this capability to another 600 stores, meaning that well over a thousand of our stores are shipping directly to our guest this season.","In total, these stores are expected to ship more than three times as many units as last year accounting for about a third of our digital volume during the peak period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. Shipping for stores delivers a number of benefits to our guests, and to our business. Most importantly, this capability reduces shipping times given the proximity of these stores to the vast majority of the U.S. population.","With that proximity of guests, we also save on shipping, helping to relieve the pressure from shipping growth in our P&L. It also allows us to balance our inventory across our store and network, maintaining in stocks while reducing markdowns in store locations with heavy inventory.","And finally, store shipping released pressure on our fulfilment centers, especially during peak season, allowing the entire network to function more effectively. Our three delayed allocation centers, which have all come online this year, or another way we have created capacity. These facilities allow us to aggregate inventory and slower moving, but harder to forecast categories, allowing us to improve our store allocation without hurting lead times.","During peak season, we\u2019ll be fully utilizing these facilities to free up space in our regional DC's, to enhance the overall speed and reliability across our distribution network. Finally, as a result of our efforts to optimize inbound processes, we expect to double the percentage of our holiday receipts that are processed within 24 hours of arrival. This will enhance our store in stocks or freeing up meaningful space in our regional DC's, further enhancing speed and efficiency.","While we're just getting started, our team is really excited about our progress in modernizing Targets operations, and we're pleased to hear from many of you that you're beginning to notice the difference when you shop with us, while that's great to hear, I want to emphasize that we are not slowing down. Our team is energized and focused on our plans for the next year and beyond, and I look forward to sharing those plans with you in February.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy who will share her perspective on our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks John and hello everyone. Our third quarter financial performance was much stronger than expected, driven by strong execution across the board. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 was 22% higher than last year, and well above the top end of our guidance range.","This performance would be noteworthy in any environment, but it is especially impressive given our challenging sales trends. Comparable sales declined 0.2% in the third quarter, this is a full percentage point better than our second quarter performance and near the high end of our guidance range, however it's well below the growth we expect to generate over time.","With removal or pharmacy in clinic sales from this year's results, total sales were down nearly 7% in the quarter. Digital sales increased more than 26% contributing about 70 basis points through our comparable sales. Digital growth was fastest in our Signature categories and was particularly strong in kids, driven by the strength of our back-to-school offering and the launch of Cat & Jack. This is particularly exciting because signature categories are items and brands uniquely Target.","Among the components of our comp sales, transactions were down 1.2% in the third quarter and one percentage point improvement from the second quarter. Average ticket increased 1% in line with our performance so far this year. I want to pause here and make it clear that while we have made significant progress we are not satisfied with a third quarter traffic and sales performance. First and foremost, we are focused on restoring growth to both of these metrics over time. Our REDcard program is our most powerful loyalty vehicle and it\u2019s continuing to grow.","Sales penetration on our REDcards was 24.3% in the third quarter, in line with our expectations, and two percentage points ahead of last year. Excluding the benefit from the pharmacy transaction, penetration was up about 80 basis points in the quarter, which is consistent with our year to-day performance.","Moving down the P&L, our third quarter segment EBITDA margin rate was 9.9% up from 8.6% last year, about two-thirds of this improvement was driven by an increase in our gross margin rate combined with the benefit of a lower SG&A expense rate. Specifically our gross margin rate improved about 80 basis points compared to last year, which was much stronger than expected. This improvement was entirely driven by merchandize mix resulting from both the pharmacy transaction and strong performance in our signature categories.","On the SG&A line, we saw about 40 basis points of improvement from a year ago, which reflects the benefit of our ongoing cost control efforts. As John mentioned, we continue to find ways to eliminate non guest facing labor in our stores. This creates capacity that allow their team to focus on guest service while maintaining outstanding efficiency to support our financial performance.","For the first time this year, our quarter end inventory was lower than a year ago, the team has done a fantastic job responding to the recent slowdown in our sales by effectively managing inventory and receipt. With this strong execution, we've seen outstanding gross margin performance so far this year, and as we enter the peak of the holiday season, we feel very good about the level and the composition of our inventory.","Let\u2019s turn now to capital deployment. We paid $345 million in dividends during the third quarter, and returned another $878 million through share repurchase. A portion of our third quarter repurchase activity was accomplished through an accelerated share repurchase agreement. A portion of this ASR was settled after the end of the quarter.","Through the first three quarters of 2016 we have repurchased more than $3 billion of our shares which keeps us on track to invest $3.5 billion or more in share repurchase this year. One thing to note is that during the third quarter, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchases authorization. We\u2019ll begin repurchasing shares under this new program when we complete the current $10 billion program.","As of the end of the third quarter we had approximately $300 million of remaining capacity on the current $10 billion program. And one other item to note, during the third quarter we obtained a new $2.5 billion credit facility that expires in October of 2021. This new facility replaces a two and a quarter billion dollar facility that was scheduled to expire in 2018.","We have never borrowed under any of our prior credit facilities, and we would not expect to borrow under the new one either, however, it provides an important source of backup liquidity, and it serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program, which we use to fund our seasonal borrowing needs.","Reflecting our focus on disciplined capital deployment, one of our goals is to grow our after tax return on invested capital into the mid-teens overtime. I am pleased to share that we are making significant progress toward this goal. For the 12 months through the end of the third quarter, our business generated and after tax ROIC of 16.3%, however that calculation includes the one time game from the pharmacy sales which we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year, excluding that gain, our third quarter after tax ROIC was 14.3%, up about 130 basis points from a year ago.","Now let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Consistent with last quarter, we are maintaining a cautious outlook. Given the current environment and the prospect of a very competitive holiday season, with that in mind, we are planning our fourth quarter comparable sales to be roughly consistent with our third quarter performance in a range around flat plus or minus 1%.","Total sales are expected to decline about 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. This will be the last quarter in which we will be copying [ph] over pharmacy and clinic sales from the prior year. In terms of operating margin, we're expecting our fourth quarter segment EBIT margin rate will be up slightly, about 10 basis points higher than last year.","This outlook is based on an expected 40 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin rate, driven entirely by a lower SG&A expense rate. Offsetting this improvement, we expect to see an increase of about 30 basis points in our depreciation and amortization expense rate, this will be driven by approximately $50 million of accelerated depreciation related to our 2017 story model program, along with the de-leveraging effect of the total sales decline resulting from the pharmacy transaction.","Altogether, in the fourth quarter we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of a $1.55 to $1.75. When we combine the fourth quarter expectations with our year-to-date performance we're expecting to generate approximately flat comfortable sales for the full year, and full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.30.","Notably, the top half of this updated EPS range is within the range we laid out at the beginning of the year. This demonstrates how effectively our team has performed in the face of unexpected sales challenges.","Looking in the next year our first focus is to restore growth in our traffic and comparable sales, with sales growth, a strong gross margin mix and continued cost discipline, we believe we can sustainably grow both the top line and the bottom line over time. I look forward to discussing our longer-term aspirations and our outlook for 2017 performance at our meeting with you in February.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian who has a few closing remarks. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Cathy. Before we open up for questions, I want to pause and recap our position as we enter the final quarter of the year. Yea-to-date, comp sales have been about flat, and we believe it's prudent to plan for a similar trend in the fourth quarter. That said, we're very excited about our plans for the holiday season, and our team is focused on outperforming our plan, gaining market share and delivering positive comp sales across our business, not just in signature categories.","On the adjusted EPS line, we have grown more than 10% so far this year and based on our fourth quarter expectations, our updated range for full-year adjusted EPS overlaps with the original guidance range we provided last March, reflecting the team\u2019s strong execution in the face of challenging sales trends.","Signature category sales continue to far outpace the company average, and we continue to gain market share in these categories. And because our digital growth continues to outpace the industry average, we continue to gain share in the digital channel as well. So while we continue to adjust our near-term tactics to better maintain the balance on both sides or expect more, pay less brand promise, we believe we have the right long term strategic plans to sustain Targets performance over time. I look forward to covering both our fourth quarter results and our longer term strategic and financial plans at our financial community meeting which we\u2019ll be hosting in New York on February 28.","We will be providing more details on timing and location soon, but in the meantime, please mark your calendars for that date. With that, we\u2019ll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Cathy, Mark, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul","Good morning. I just had a couple of questions for you. On pricing throughout the quarter and I guess into the holiday season, what are you seeing and what are you expecting in competition, and talk a little bit about your ongoing strength in toys, could you just talk about the drivers to the toys in the fourth quarter, and how you expect that to perform as a category?","Brian Cornell","Bob, good morning. As we think about the holiday season, we expect it to be a very competitive, promotional environment like we've seen over the last couple of years. So, we think we've got great plans in place and we're very excited about the merchandising, the marketing and promotional plans, and we think we're going to be very competitive throughout the season.","As it pertains to the toys, again, we've had a multi-year positive run in that category and one of the things that's really been important for us is working with key partners, like Disney Mattel, Hasbro to make sure we bring you exclusive items to our assortment. As we go into the holiday season, we're excited to have 1800 exclusive items in that category, and we think that it is going to be very important to our guests throughout the holiday season.","Bob Drbul","Great, Brian. Can I just ask one more follow-up, so when you look at the business over a longer period of time, this has historically been a relatively steady business, I was just wondering when you look at the volatility between what you saw last quarter and your results and sort of your forecast for that -- the fourth quarter and within three months and it's a dramatic change in the outlook, can you just talk a little bit about exactly what is factored, what factors are driving this?","Brian Cornell","You know Bob as we think about our strategy and our approach, while we're certainly very pleased with the progress we saw in the third quarter, it's a result of being very focused on the strategy with that in place for almost two-and-a-half years now. In our results and the improvement we saw in the third quarter is really driven by one, our focus on those signature categories, our commitment to apparel and home, baby and kids, where we continue to see very strong growth and market share improvement.","We've been very committed to improving our digital engagement, and year-to-date we\u2019re up over 20%. We saw a 26% growth in the third quarter, and the investments we've been making to improve functionality and ease online is certainly connecting with our guests. We've been very focused as we've talked about in expanding our format in the new urban neighborhoods, and every time we open up a new store whether it's in New York Tribeca or Philadelphia, we're seeing a great response from our guests.","And we've been on a journey over the last couple of years to drive greater efficiency throughout our organization. And with John's leadership, we continue to see very strong improvement and operational efficiencies and cost that were returning to the bottom line.","So our focus over the third quarter is very similar to the journey we've been on for the last couple of years. And we just intensified our focus on executing against our key strategic plans.","Bob Drbul","Thanks very much. Good luck.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Cornell","Morning, Scott.","Scott Mushkin","Good morning, good performance and in controlling the controllable. So just kind of want to step back in and you know we got traffic that\u2019s negative, and trying to understand as we get out to like next year and the year beyond, where you know obviously you guys are doing a great job controlling SG&A costs, but it was very hard for retailer like Target to run this balance with traffic down and sales kind of flat especially with wage costs rising as rapidly, so, Brian if you could take it out and kind of talk about the strategy to drive traffic, get the sales up, I think you are through the number out there 3% comp growth, 2017 and beyond, just how do we get there?","Brian Cornell","Scott, as we think about the next several years, we are going to continue to see as make significant investments in our assets improving in-store experience. We're already seeing the benefits of the investments we've made in apparel and home. We're very pleased with some of the learning from LA 25 that we\u2019ll be transitioning into our new remodels as we go forward.","So we think the importance of the in-store experience, great customer service continuing to bring newness to our assortment, elevating and developing our own brands. I think one of the big highlights for Target in 2016 is the way our guest has reacted to two great new brands, both Pillowfort and Cat & Jack have been incredibly well received.","The style, the quality, the value we are delivering is connecting with our guests. So the combination of gradients or experience, making sure, we surround our guests with great customer service, whether they're shopping in our store or they've ordered online and they're coming in to pick up that order, and then delivering great Target brands, at a value.","So we think that combination is the strategy that drives traffic into our stores, cars into our parking lot and even more engagement online.","Scott Mushkin","Right, perfect. And just as a follow-up to kind of thinking about the 2017 and beyond, I know CVS was out [ph] since last week, you know they're losing a lot of scripts, because of the dynamics that are going on there and now clearly you don't script don't matter anymore to you guys, but how about the traffic impact on Target as we get it 2017 and beyond, have you guys thought about that, and what that can be?","Brian Cornell","Scott, I will start with scripts matter a lot to us. And key to the partnership with CVS is making sure we're working together to drive scripts because back to the importance of traffic scripts will be an important part of driving traffic to our stores. And we were very pleased in the third quarter with the progress we're seeing. We're seeing much greater awareness now that we've completed the new branding, the combination of our in-store marketing and CVS marketing is their PBM is driving increased traffic to the pharmacies.","So that is a very important lever going forward. And we're very confident in our partnership. John Mulligan works very closely with the CVS team. We've got great plans in place for the fourth quarter, and even stronger plans as we go into 2017. So that is a very very important part of the traffic equation. And we think over time, that's going to be a key driver of traffic into our stores.","Scott Mushkin","All right, perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. I really want to follow up on grocery & food and the strategy there, and how we're going to use that to drive traffic, and also on traffic, an update on your digital initiatives. I know you were doing some tasks of combining Cartwheel with REDcard, just love to hear how those are going, and how you think those could help drive traffic into next year?","Brian Cornell","Greg, let me start on the grocery side, and clearly we have more work to do there. But we feel like we're making very good progress. Changes we made to assortment, improvements we made to the quality of our produce items and we're certainly pleased with the reaction we're seeing as we enhance the experience in our LA 25 stores.","That being the case, we've got to continue to make sure we build a greater connection with our guests as it pertains to the convenience food offering we provide. And Mark and I are working closely on the next phase of our grocery evolution to make sure that we continue to provide the right assortments, the right value, the right quality our guests expect from Target while they are shopping our stores. So you'll see a lot more of that when we get together in February, but we recognize that's an area that we've got to continue to drive progress in.","From a loyalty standpoint, we are working very closely with the marketing team to ensure that when we get together with you in February, we\u2019ll be able to talk about the next iteration of our personalization and loyalty programs. Key to that Greg is bringing together some of the great assets we already have in place, leveraging our REDcard, leveraging cartwheel, which continues to see great response from the guests, and making it easy for the guests to leverage the existing loyalty assets we have in place.","So we think that's the key unlock as we go into 2017 and beyond and that will be a key topic of the conversation when we see you in February.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan [ph] Fletcher with Bernstein.","Unidentified Analyst","My first time caller long time listener, a great quarter guys. Fantastic.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Unidentified Analyst","My question is who else can win in urban environments? I know you only have a few dots with the flexible formats, but we think you guys are pretty far ahead in terms of knowledge out how to run mass merchants in urban stores, and mostly your competitors or pharmacy stores who are good competitors, but boy they need a whole lot of price to make it work. Do you see somebody else who's dangerous around the corner for you for taking this spot [Ph] on cities, obviously besides Amazon going ever more urban?","Brian Cornell","Brendan, we are very focused on our own opportunity. And we're in 30 locations today we think we have the opportunity to enter many many new neighborhoods, and we're really focused on making sure we build the back end capabilities, in supply chain, in assortment management, the in-store operating capabilities it takes to run these smaller stores. But we think the unique opportunity we have is bringing the best of Target to these individual neighborhoods, making sure that we custom tailor assortment we bring the right assortment of apparel and home, baby and kids that's right for that neighbourhood, complement it with convenient boots, and household essentials that really make that local Target run impactful for the guests.","So we're still learning we're very pleased with the feedback, but as we enter very competitive markets like New York, we're going to learn a lot from Tribeca, we\u2019ll take that to other locations. As we do more and more business, adjacent to college campuses, we\u2019ll understand more and more about the needs of the college student, but we really think right now we've got a unique opportunity to leverage this new footprint as a future growth element in our strategy and the guests continues to say, no thank you every time we enter a new neighborhoods.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Brian Cornell","Good morning, Matt","Matt Fassler","My question is focused on gross margin, where you really turned the corner, year-on-year when you back out the pharmacy business. You\u2019ll spoke to the impact of mix, but can you talk about the impact that you're seeing from cost cuts at the point of purchase for you, and how deep we are into that into that after where you expect that to be sustained going forward?","Brian Cornell","Matt, I'd start with, you know we feel really good about the way Mark and his team have managed gross margin throughout the quarter. But it's really a by-product of the strength we continue to see in those important signature categories, and both in-store but importantly online.","Our growth has been led by apparel and home great strength and baby and kids, those important high-margin categories that drive differentiation for our brand. So the benefits that we're seeing gross margin are a byproduct of the strategy we've had in place and really making sure that we're building market share, we're bringing great style and design and newness to those signature categories and the payback has been margin expansion wall we continue to invest in value, and getting back to rebalancing our brand promise we're bringing tremendous product to the expect more side.","And now, we've rebalance our value message on a pay less side. So we were able to invest in value throughout the third quarter and still see gross margin rate expansion. So we feel really good about the balance we're bringing there and think that could be sustained over time.","Matt Fassler","Thank you, Brian.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis","Hi. Good morning. Great to see the sequential improvement in trends.","Brian Cornell","Thanks John.","John Zolidis","Question about some of the metrics within the within the comp. Looking at the average unit retail up 3.5% and units per transaction is down. I noticed that that has been the case for about 10 consecutive quarters now. So I just curious you can talk about what's driving the average unit retail up and units per transaction down? Thank you. ","Brian Cornell","Again, John, it comes back to the mix of our business and the strength we're seeing particularly in categories like home. The strength we're seeing in apparel and accessories. Some of the strengths we're seeing in baby and kids. So, those are important categories. Obviously in many cases, higher ticket, still a great value for our guests but higher ticket. And obviously offset by some weakness we've seen in the grocery categories. So the mix is clearly impacting those metrics we're seeing. And we feel very good about the way that guest has reacted to the quality, the style and the value we're offering those signature categories.","John Zolidis","Is the e-commerce growth also a factor then I would imagine that's more focused in to the higher ticket [ph] categories?","Brian Cornell","And again, as we noted in our earlier comments while overall we saw our digital business grow by 26%. The bulk of that business, the high growth areas were in apparel and home. So again higher ticket items we feel really good about the progress we're making from a digital mix standpoint and that's also coming through in the metrics we're seeing.","John Zolidis","Great. Thanks and good luck.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning.","Brian Cornell","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Horvers","I want to think about the shift of the digital promotion in the second to the third quarter. How larger contributor was that to your delta and comp performance in the third quarter versus second quarter. I ask this because if we look at these two quarters together that's the low end of your 4Q guide. And so, as we look ahead what are the, I guess, big efforts or big drivers that you think drive the business to potentially the higher end of that range. Is it is it to focus on your customer can shop more around events? Is it the merchandise inside, what drives the higher end of the comp outlook for 4Q?","John Mulligan","Chris, backing up and I know there are number of embedded questions there. One, there was some shift because of the promotion between Q2 and Q3. I'd really focus on the year-to-date number. Year to-date from a digital standpoint we've been growing at 20%. As we talked about earlier in the call, we're very pleased with the reaction we're seeing during key event periods back-to-college, back-to-school a very important period for us both in-store and online. And we think the combination of the investments we've made to improve ease functionality of our digital engagement and the fact that we're certainly showing the ability to win during key holiday and traumatic period that's the right balance for us going forward.","So, I think digital is going to be an important part of our growth strategy going forward. We think digital is certainly the way our guests interfaces with the brand whether they're in store or online, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making. And our overall growth rate is approximately 2x the digital industry. So, we're building market share. We're winning during key seasons and we certainly expect that to be a key driver to our fourth quarter success.","Chris Horvers","And then, just one quick follow-up question, can you talk about how much, I think CVS was 60 or 70 basis points to the gross margin the third quarter, you're going to start to lap that in the fourth quarter. It sounds are sounds like you're guiding the flat. So just help us understand how that progresses out into the fourth quarter? Thanks very much.","Cathy Smith","Yes. So Chris, this is Cathy. As we said we're guiding for EBIT margin to be up about 10 basis points. We do -- CVS was a \u2013 we closed it remember about halfway through the fourth quarter last year. So we'll get a little bit of that impact still. The biggest driver in the fourth quarter as we said is SG&A. So we'll continue to see some improvement there and that's going to get that 10 basis points.","Chris Horvers","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ohmes with Bank of America.","Robert Ohmes","Good morning and congrats Brian and team. Great work in what's not been an easy environment.","Brian Cornell","Robert, we appreciate that. Thank you.","Robert Ohmes","The question I had was just -- was actually this might be more of a John Mulligan question. I was hoping John, you could maybe give a little more detail on what the opportunities are from here in terms of in stocks RFID, the stuff you're working on and sort of how that could support store cops issue in the fourth quarter and as you head into next year.","John Mulligan","Great question Robbie, I think the team has made a lot of progress. And as we said at least the way we measure it today our in-stocks, out of stock is actual number we can focus more on is at are historically low numbers, so we feel great about that. Having said that we think there continues to be significant opportunity for us. And I think we see opportunity first at a store level ensuring we always have what the guest wants when they walk in, because even though we've improved meaningfully there's still a lot of distance there to go.","And then more important than that digitally ensuring we have the right unit at the right place for the guests whether they want to come in-store and pick it up whether we're going to shift that from a store or ship that from a fulfilment center. And today we're not completely optimized there either and so while we've seen great progress and there's absolutely benefit to the guest and their trust with us when they come into the store over time.","We still think there's a lot of runway there for us to improve and you'll continue to see us focus on reliability and speed in our supply chain and those are the two things that we will continue to drive against over not only next year but the next several years.","Robert Ohmes","Great. Thanks so much.","John Mulligan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","Hi. It's Dan Binder. Thank you. You highlighted that back-to-school was strong for you and it seems that the consumers are shopping Target when there is an event which could be good for holiday. But I'm curious what you saw in the in the post back-to-school period and just generally when you look back over the last year or so in between big events whether it's you know Memorial Day event or Father's Day event or search, what you're seeing those traffic trends between the big events?","Brian Cornell","Dan, its great question and obviously we feel really good about the support we receive during back-to-college and back-to-school. In those off holiday periods we've got to make sure we got the right balance between newness and those important style categories and great value in our household essentials and food. And Mark and his team have spent a tremendous amount of time reshaping our promotional strategies, making sure that both in our circular, but also in-store it's really clear to our guests that we've got this great combination of newness and style and the value our guests deserves and is looking for in those key household essential areas.","So, we've done a lot of work in store. I think with Mark's leadership we're clarifying value on our end caps clear assortment that connects with a guest in those off holiday periods. So, I feel really good about the progress. You'll see more of that as we go into the fourth quarter. But why don\u2019t I let Mark talk about some of the work that he's been leading as we think about really ensuring that value message is very clear to our guests when they're walking our stores each week.","Mark Tritton","Yes, hi Brian thanks Dan. What we\u2019ve seen is like a really hyper competitive market in the first half of the year and it really made us take start to look at how do we represent and resonate value to our guests more readily. So what you're seeing emerging in third quarter and more in the fourth quarter and beyond is a representation not just a price and value in our circulars as Brian talked about but in store in showing the guest clearly see that value up front and center.","So representation on our end caps increasing single price point, end caps to really generate above that value and really delivering on expect more pay or less. So this is a continuing trend and then that the spaces between the cases, and all events that you raised, as Brian said we are hyper focused on that, we've seen some strength and some of our options that we put in place and really looking forward to our plans about how do we continue guest traffic and love our post major events where we do win.","Dan Binder","And then if I could just another question, in the last quarter or two you've highlighted that the electronics business was I think about a 70 basis point hit to the comps, so I was just curious if you could help us understand what that looks like in Q3? And then on the scripts that you mentioned were getting better, trend wise it sounds positive but I was curious if you look at the script trends relative to what you were doing, when you were on the pharmacy business, if there's some sort of relevant measure you can give us there that would be helpful?","Brian Cornell","So let me start with E&E [ph], as I\u2019ve mentioned in my earlier comment, we feel really good about our plans for the fourth quarter. And obviously, entertainment electronics and toys are critically important gifting items for the fourth quarter, so again I think the work that Mark and his team have done to make sure working with our vendor partners we have a combination of new items exclusive items, items that are on trend, we've seen a great reaction to our toy and gifting catalog, and we think like that we are very well positioned for the fourth quarter. Those categories did trend downward in Q3, but the important part of the year is in front of us, and I think we're very well positioned.","And from a script standpoint, we are still rebuilding the momentum in that space but sequentially we've seen improvement from Q1 to Q2 and Q3 and we recognize that with time as the brandings in place as our in-store marketing and the CVS marketing takes shape, we're going to be rebuilding and growing scripts in that very important part of our store. Operator, we've got time for one more call.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company","Oliver Chen","Hi, thanks. Some solid margin and inventory control, just wanted to ask you about fill in versus stock up. It\u2019s likely related to your -- the progress you made towards the value messaging so just curious about how you're feeling about that dynamic? And then I wanted you to try to brief us on the reality versus Amazon, the near term strategies in terms of you know how you'll be competitively position versus Amazon and the holiday season and then as you look to bricks and clicks in the seamless experience over the longer term for long-term investors what should, what should the key factors be as we engage in that share opportunity versus Amazon? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Oliver, great way to wrap up the call. From up fill-in and stock-up standpoint, again the work that Mark just talked about on the value side is clearly addressing the, the fill-in guests. And I feel very good about the progress we've made and will continue to make in that state. I think to the broader question it\u2019s a terrific way for us to wrap up before we all get together in New York City. We continue to feel very good about the strategy we have in place and how that will allow us to be very competitive and continue to win in the current retail environment.","We think the investments we are making in our stores are critically important and that store experience that we continue to elevate is a very important measure for our guests. We've learned as I hope you have, guests still like physical stores and year-to-date still almost 90% of all retail shopping is taking place in a physical store. So we want to make sure we've got a great experience, we've got great service, we continue to elevate that experience in service and combine it with outstanding merchandise and value every time our guests shop. We think of strategy of moving into new neighborhoods whether it's these densely populated urban centers or on college campuses is a critical growth vehicle, and again the reaction we've seen every time we open up a store in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and certainly in New York tells us our guests love the convenience of having Target right there in their neighbourhood.","But we're also continuing to make investments online and we want to make sure we continue to give our guests, the choice of shopping anyway they want, the ease of shopping online and picking up in our store, which we think is going to be a very important factor during the fourth quarter, but building out those capabilities, leveraging our stores as flexible fulfilment centers as we go into this holiday season, well over a thousand locations will be locations that not only you can shop in and pick up, but we're using to deliver the last mile, we think that's a huge competitive advantage.","So we feel very good about the strategy we have in place. We think it's a strategy that will win not only in the short term but over the long term and we look forward to seeing all of you in New York in February.","So with that operator, we're going to wrap up our third quarter call. I appreciate everyone participating, and we look forward to see you in New York in February.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and you may now disconnect."],"20384":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call February 26, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregg Steinhafel - Chairman, President and CEO","Kathy Tesija - EVP, Merchandising","John Mulligan - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 26, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.","Gregg Steinhafel","Good morning, and welcome to our 2013 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, I will provide a high level summary of our fourth quarter results and strategic priorities for the year ahead, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights, and the holiday season. And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our financial outlook for 2014. Following John\u2019s remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in the 8-K we filed this morning.","Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","Target\u2019s fourth quarter financial results reflect better than expected U.S segments performance in the first three weeks of the holiday season, followed by meaningfully softer results, following our December 19th announcement that criminals had gained access to guest payment card data in our U.S stores.","In total, fourth quarter comparable sales decreased 2.5% consistent with our updated guidance in January. Throughout the quarter our team managed the business extremely well, adjusting both inventory and expenses to match the rapidly changing pace of sales. As a result, our US operations generated fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 at the high-end of the updated guidance we provided in January.","In Canada, we worked diligently to leverage holiday traffic in an effort to clear excess inventory. Markdowns resulting from this effort drove a very low gross margin rate, but allowed us to reduce average inventory per store in Canada by approximately 30% between the beginning and end of the fourth quarter.","Canadian segment EPS dilution was $0.40 in the quarter, $0.05 better than the updated guidance we provided in January. We are pleased that our early cycle Canadian stores have seen the most improvement giving us confidence that we will continue to see continued improvement across all our Canadian stores in 2014.","Fourth quarter GAAP EPS of $0.81 reflects U.S and Canadian segment performance along with costs related to our recent restructuring in data breach along with small accounting and tax matters. As we work to address the impact of the mid-December data breach, we have put the welfare of our guests at the center of every decision we\u2019ve made.","We have communicated in early and often providing the best information we had about new facts in ongoing -- on the ongoing investigation. We consistently assured our guests that they would have zero liability for any unauthorized charges on their card accounts resulting from the breach.","We increased fraud detection for REDcard holders and extended free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for any guests who has ever shopped one of our U.S stores. We are truly sorry for the impact this breach has had on our guests, team members and other stakeholders and I want to reiterate that we are committed for making things right.","We know these initial steps are part of a longer process. We continue to listen to our guests and we know that this incident and recent security breaches at other companies have shaken their confidence in both Target and the U.S payment system more broadly.","To rebuild guest confidence, we\u2019re committed to an end-to-end review in cooperation with third-party experts to understand how the breach occurred, the identification and acceleration of solutions to provide enhanced protection in the future and engagement with third-party experts to protect the industry and consumers from future threats.","Accordingly, we're taking the following steps. We are conducting an end-to-end forensic investigation of our processes, systems and personnel to make informed decisions on potential security enhancements. We are accelerating the adoption of advanced chip enabled technology, investing more than $100 million to equip our stores and to issue Target branded smart chip credit and debit cards.","We have long supported this more secured technology; a broad adoption in the U.S market has been elusive. We believe that recent events will help the industry to reach a tipping point to an accelerated option in the U.S and we are investing to ensure that Target is a clear leader in driving this change.","We are working collaboratively with a broad set of stakeholders in the payment card space including banks, retailers, trade associations, payment processors and networks to share in advance best practices and foster future innovation.","We helped launch and will be an active leader in retail industry, cyber security and data privacy initiative. In addition, we are investing $5 million in a new coalition with the Better Business Bureau and National Cyber Security Alliance and the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance to advance public education around cyber security and the dangers of consumer scams.","While we can't yet assess the full impact of this crime against Target and our guests, we\u2019re pleased that sales have started to recover from the trends we observed following breach related announcements in December and January. Importantly, because we\u2019re in a strong financial position, we expect to absorb any near-term financial impacts while continuing to invest in projects that are key to our long-term success.","Our Company has a long history of innovation, disciplined management, and a strong long-term financial performance and we are committed to upholding the principles which has -- have sustained this Company success for many decades. And while 2013 was a disappointing year financially, we have entered the New Year with the right plans in place to grow profitably and generate meaningfully improved financial performance in 2014 and beyond.","In the U.S., we have demonstrated our ability to manage the business with discipline and generate strong financial performance even in a challenging environment. In fact, Kathy will outline in more detail we were very pleased with our holiday season results prior to the announcement of the data breach.","In preparation for fourth quarter, we may change this to our holiday promotion and marketing and we were pleased that our in stocks were running at all-time highs. As a result, U.S segment fourth quarter sales were running ahead of plan prior to December 19th.","Looking ahead, we will apply the insights we gained in the holiday season to connect with our guests at delivering merchandize and promotions thoughtfully designed to appeal to them based on what's on their mind at each point in the year, moving Target beyond compelling, to becoming irresistible for our guests.","We made enormous progress in our multichannel efforts throughout 2013 as we meaningfully increased conversion both on our website and on our mobile apps. We acquired Chef's Catalog, Cooking.com and Dermstore, extending our online assortment by providing our guests access to additional high-end brands in key home and beauty categories.","We launched Cartwheel, our unique mobile savings tool which has far exceeded expectations in both adoption and engagement and we accelerated our investments in flexible fulfillment. As a result, throughout the year, growth in our digital traffic and sales outpaced industry averages. We launched in-store pick up chain-wide at the beginning of November and with very little marketing, this new offering became a meaningful driver of digital traffic and sales.","Our store teams did an outstanding job delivering great service when guests arrived to pick up these orders and this is particularly impressive since we launched the service during the busiest time of the year. We will continue to invest in systems, data and processes to enhance our flexible fulfillment capabilities in 2014 and beyond.","In our stores we are committed to enhancing the guest experience by adding dedicated service to key categories like beauty, baby and electronics and by providing training and technology that allows our stores team to go beyond providing basic service to solving problems for our guests. And we're continuing to pilot innovations to our store formats.","Based on the initial rollout of the CityTarget format and the high single digit comparable sales we're seeing in our second year CityTarget stores, we're analyzing opportunities to redeem the size and enhance the flexibility of this format opening up a wider universe of potential sites in dense urban areas.","While on the work on CityTarget continues, we've also developed a separate smaller format called Target Express at about 15% of the size of one of our general merchandize stores, we believe this design provides us with a fantastic opportunity to expand into new trade areas providing a convenient solution to guests who can easily visit one of our other formats.","While we expect to offer a carefully curated assortment in frequency categories like food, health care, beauty and other household essentials, Target Express will also offer discretionary categories including home, electronics and seasonal. Throughout the store we will feature our own brands which offer guests an unbeatable combination of quality and price. We plan to open our first pilot location of this format here in our home market in July so we can carefully study both operational and financial results before we determine our plans to expand this format to other markets.","Throughout the organization we continue to find new opportunities to optimize expenses, freeing up resources we can apply to new initiatives. In 2013 our teams saved approximately $200 million by reprioritizing their activities and finding more efficient ways to get things done. Our expense optimization efforts are not a short-term project but a complete overall of the way we work and the team continues to find new opportunities. As a result, we expect the benefit of our expense optimization efforts to reach $1 billion in annualized savings by 2015. I'm proud that our entire team has embraced this effort to transform how we work.","In Canada the team has moved from a year focused on opening a record number of stores to optimizing the business in run state. As we enter 2014 with a much cleaner inventory position, the team's number one operational focus is on in-stocks, ensuring we have the right quantity of each item in the right place at the right time. In addition, we continue to invest in technology and training to enhance both the tools our team uses and their ability to deploy them most effectively.","We're also continuing to implement innovative marketing and merchandizing programs in Canada to raise awareness for our frequency categories like grocery, household essentials, beauty and healthcare. Throughout 2014 we will focus on conveying the depth and breadth of our assortment in those categories and the unbeatable value we provide to our everyday pricing, 5% of the awards, price match and our flier. With enhanced guest awareness of our unbeatable prices combined with the benefit of improved operations, we expect guest shopping frequency to build throughout 2014, driving improvement in sales and profitability.","While 2013 will clearly be remembered as the challenging year, I am proud of team's efforts to transform our business and position the company for long-term success. And I want to sincerely thank the Target team for their tireless effort to help our guests recover from the data breach. While there is much more work to be done, I'm inspired by their singular focus on our guests and making things right. As a result, I'm confident we will look back on this incident and see that we emerged from it even stronger than before.","Now Kathy will provide more detail on our fourth quarter results and key initiatives as we enter 2014. Kathy?","Kathy Tesija","Thanks, Gregg. In our last conference call, we outlined our plans for the holiday season and mentioned that fourth quarter sales were on track through the first half of November. As we progressed through Black Friday week and the first two weeks of December, guests continued to respond to our promotions and sales ran ahead of our plan.","Following the data breach announcement and the rapid change in the pace of our sales, the team reacted quickly making nimble adjustments to minimize our excess inventory. This quick response allowed us to end the year with a clean inventory position. And while our fourth quarter gross margin reflected the addition of clearance activity resulting from the sales slowdown, our team did a great job minimizing the impact.","As we built our holiday plans, our goal was to cut through the clutter and reach our guests with compelling offers on exciting merchandize, specifically we aligned our weekly deals and events so guests were receiving a clear message across all channels. And because our guests are budget conscious and love to find deals, we intentionally layered promotions across our circular, cartwheel and our catalog to provide unbeatable value. We used our direct channels to drive urgency at key points of the season and we offered more broad attention-getting promotions like 40% off sweaters.","Consistent with past years, we featured hot deals on key items but attracted more attention by offering deeper discounts on fewer items and we were very pleased with the guest response. For the quarter overall, our non-discretionary categories generally saw the strongest sales performance. However, on our more discretionary categories electronics saw an increase in fourth quarter comparable sales led by mobile phones, tablets and video game hardware and software. We also saw relative strength in our sporting goods and housewares categories.","Digital channels had a very strong holiday season. Thanksgiving was our biggest digital sales day ever with mobile devices accounting for a full 25% of those sales. We were recently recognized as having the most browsed app by a smartphone and tablet in 2013 and Mobile Commerce Daily just named Target Mobile Retailer and Commerce Website of the Year. This is the second time we've been named Mobile Retailer of the Year and we're pleased to be the only retailer to be honored with the award twice.","An important factor in our digital success was the fourth quarter rollout of the opportunity to buy online and pick up in-store. In-store pick up requests represented about 10% of fourth quarter digital orders but they peaked at a much higher rate before Christmas as guests relied on the service as a great solution for last-minute gift shopping. About 30% of store visits to pick up an online order resulted in store shopping on that same trip and the size of that store transaction was much larger than an average store trip.","While we've rolled out the capabilities with an external commitment to have orders ready in four hours or less, our team quickly attained our internal goal to have most orders ready in one hour or better. Our survey showed consistently high levels of guest satisfaction with this service and this capability has accelerated our mobile conversion rates.","We're also pleased with the continued growth of Cartwheel, our digital savings app, which ended 2013 with over 5 million users who have already saved more than $43 million. Younger guests are particularly engaged by Cartwheel as more than half of its users are Millennials, a much higher percentage than they represent in our overall guest base.","Redemption rates on Cartwheel are more than 10 times higher than DC and other direct channels like receipt marketing and email and our analysis indicate that its driving incremental trips and sales. Our pre-Black Friday deals resulted in one of the biggest days ever for Cartwheel as they drove one-third of our active users into Target stores on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.","We continue to work to enhance the Cartwheel experience. We recently added the ability to scan bar codes to find out if there's a Cartwheel deal on an item and added the capability to signup for Cartwheel directly through a Target account and email while continuing to provide access to the App through Facebook.","As Gregg mentioned, we continue to listen to our guests to understand how we can help them move beyond the data breach and feel confident in shopping at Target. While sales have started to recover in recent weeks and sentiment metrics have begun to improve most notably among our best guests. We continue to invest to ensure this recovery continues. Beyond our efforts in data security and chip enabled technology we're applying insights from the holiday season to make our merchandise stores and digital channels even more irresistible to our guests.","We continue to innovate in ways that differentiate both our product assortments and the guest experience, and we\u2019re investing in pricing and promotions to make our value proposition even stronger. We\u2019re very pleased with the response to Peter Pilotto for Target our most recent designer partnership which launched earlier this month. This collection which features a limited edition assortment of women\u2019s apparel, accessories and swimwear is available at most of our U.S. and Canadian stores and on target.com. We have also partnered with Net-a-Porter.com to offer a curated assortment of the collection to fans across the globe. With lots of social media buzz we a saw long lines outside many of our urban stores on the morning of the launch, and the collection quickly became Net-a-Porter\u2019s fastest selling collaboration in history.","Based on last years results Target and Sports Illustrated are once again partnering in support of the magazines annual swimsuit issue which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Target is the exclusive mass retail advertiser and official marketing partner for the issue. This years partnership includes the new 20 page flip cover that celebrates swimsuit style over the past 50 years and features Target\u2019s limited edition swimwear collection. The collection launched at Target stores and on target.com February 17, in advance of the issues on stand date and includes 10 black, gold and ivory swimsuits priced from $15 to $30.","Earlier this month, Target began offering AMBAR a new apparel collection designed with the Latina guest in mind. AMBAR is set in 50 U.S. stores this month and is also available on target.com. The line of apparel and accessories features vibrant prints and flattering cuts and silhouettes. This stylish and affordable collection has items ranging from $17 to $40. This spring Target will introduce an assortment of premium skincare featuring seven notable brands, four of which will be exclusively sold at Target. 29 by Lydia Mondavi, Borghese, Laneige and MD Complete by Dr. Zelickson along side industry favorite Vichy, La Roche Posay and Own Skin Health. These brands will be merchandised in two distinct sections, dermatological skincare and specialty skincare, and they have already launched on target.com. We\u2019ll begin rolling out the assortment to 749 U.S. Target stores beginning in March.","So what's likely to be the biggest Blu-ray and DVD release of the year Target will offer an exclusive addition of Catching Fire the second film in The Hunger Games trilogy in stores and on target.com next month. The Target exclusive Blu-ray addition includes 45 minutes of exclusive content from never before seen footage and cast interviews to a behind the scenes looks at the making of the film. This spring award winning singer Shakira is teaming up with Target for her 10th studio album and our exclusive deluxe edition featuring three bonus tracks hit stores on March 25. We announced the partnership and kicked off album preordering with a special spot during the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January.","Last month we became the exclusive retailer to feature Beats music playlists. Beats music is curated digital music streaming services that allows it's users to peep into the personal music libraries of their favorite artists and brands and have them create playlists just for them. By subscribing to Target\u2019s playlist guest can expect a very mix of songs inspired by Target\u2019s rich heritage of music and the taste of the millions who shop for albums at Target each year. In December we launched The Awesome Shop, a beta site that features the top target products recently pinned on Pinterest. The site lets guests explore, get inspired and see what other guests love just like they do in stores.","Awesome Shop highlighted the best of the best by only featuring items at the target.com review of four stars or better. We\u2019re also leveraging Pinterest in another unique way to collaborate with three of the sites most influential pinners on a series of party planning collections that will make it easy to throw a Pinterest worthy event. Joy Cho of Oh Joy, Jan Halvarson of Poppytalk and Kate Arends of Wit & Delight will each create limited time only collections launched over the course of 2014 including party d\u00e9cor, paper products and serving pieces designed in their signature esthetic.","Beyond differentiated merchandise, we continue to provide enhanced service in key areas of the store. Based on guest response to last years launch we have expanded the Target Beauty Concierge\u2019s program to more than 300 stores across the country with new markets including New York, New Jersey, San Francisco and Dallas-Fort Worth. These beauty consultants are brand agnostic and provide guests with detailed, unbiased information and a friendly face in what can often be an intermediating category.","We also continue to see great results from the pilot of our new baby layout, a completely redesigned shopping experience that offers guests inspiring insightful solutions combined with the great value they\u2019ve come to expect from Target. This new layout features a dedicated service desk with a knowledgeable baby advisor to help guests navigate the area and provide unbiased product information. Digital screens and iPads feature inspiration and interactive comparison tools and BabyCenter content such as buying guides and product reviews ","We have also incorporated an in department registry kiosk for expecting mom\u2019s or guests looking to give a gift. Merchandised displays have been lowered so guests can more easily interact with large products by travel systems in stores. We have removed barriers to enhance navigation between apparel, gear and baby essentials and we have highlighted the availability of additional online only items in key categories. This summer we plan to grow from 30 stores to more than 200 locations featuring this enhanced baby experience. And based on encouraging initial results in 2014 we\u2019ll expand our test of using mannequins in apparel in our largest format U.S. stores to elevate the store experience, create an enhanced sense of discovery and bring our unique deigns to life.","We also continued to augment our digital capabilities driving traffic and sales to all of our channels. Online our top priority in 2014 is continuing to improve the guest experience. All of our efforts will be designed to make things simple, seamless and enjoyable for our guests. To support this priority we continue to hire external talent with deep functional expertise in online merchandising, site merchandising, mobile and analytics. We have recently made enhancements focused on search, product information and checkout making it easier for guests to browse and purchase. In addition now nearly all store products are viable online making this the only place that guests can use Target\u2019s full assortment. Importantly we\u2019re making enhancements while continuing to focus on stability and speed, as a result target.com consistently ranks in the top 10 for retailer site availability and performance.","Given the profile of our guests, mobile is more important at Target than for many of our peers. For example, Target\u2019s guest traffic from tablets and mobile phones is greater than our traffic from traditional computers and the shift towards mobile shows no signs of slowing down. In fact usage of the Target App doubled in the short period between last summer and the end of the year. To maintain our strong momentum in mobile we\u2019re testing and learning from new features including List Building, Mapping and Cartwheel capabilities launched during the holiday season. We\u2019re improving conversion by streamlining checkouts and enhancing product information and dynamic content and we are investing to amplify the in-store mobile experience by rolling out guided maps, in-store search and expanded assortment chain wide later this year.","We also continue to invest in our flexible fulfillment capabilities which combine the strengths of our digital, store and distribution aspects to provide speed and convenience for our guests. These capabilities allow our stores to add value in new ways, serve our guests as both showroom and fulfillment centers. Following the holiday seasons success of in-store pick up we are moving quickly to roll out the capabilities to shift online orders from our stores this fall.","This new capability will create multiple benefits for both Target as our guests, including shorter shipping times, reduced expenses, lower markdown rates and improved in-stocks. And because our investments in flexible fulfillment drive greater utilization of our existing stores and distribution center assets, we expect to earn an outstanding return on these investments over time.","Finally, we're pleased with initial performance of Target Ticket, our streaming video service and we continue to invest in features to better serve guest changing needs and behaviors both inside and outside their home. In 2014 we will coordinate our promotions across channels to provide irresistible video offers across our stores, Target.com and Target Ticket.","While our fourth quarter results softened following the December 19 announcement of the data breach, we are pleased with the guest response to our holiday season merchandizing and marketing efforts and we're confident in our plans for 2014. As always our focus remains on our guests helping them regain their confidence in their Target while delivering irresistible content and experiences in every channel. We believe that our efforts will drive a continued recovery in the pace of our sales and position Target for profitable growth in 2014 and beyond.","Now, John will share his insights on our fourth quarter financial performance and our plans for the coming year. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Kathy. Our fourth quarter financial results reflect strong efforts by our team to handle separate challenges in both our U.S. and Canadian segments. In the U.S. comparable sales declined 2.5% consistent with the updated guidance we provided in our January press release. This sales performance reflects a 5.5% decline in transactions partially offset by an increase in average ticket.","Prior to the announcement of the data breach, fourth quarter comparable sales were running positive reflecting the success of our holiday merchandizing marketing plan. Immediately following news of the breach, sales turned meaningfully negative but began to recover in January. And while it's impossible to measure precisely, we believe we would have seen even more improvement had there not been extreme weather across much of the country.","Fourth quarter sales penetration on our REDcards was 20.9%, up 5.4 percentage points from a year ago. While the rate of increase slowed down following the breach, year-over-year penetration continued to grow hundreds of basis points through the end of the quarter. Fourth quarter U.S. EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were down more than a percentage point from last year's rates, which we were advised to reflect combined results from our former U.S. retail and credit card segments. These profit margins were below our expectations going into the quarter, driven almost entirely by gross margin rate which declined about 20 basis points from the year ago.","This performance reflects about 20 basis points of benefit from this year's change in vendor payments offset by higher than expected markdowns related to the 10% off we offered prior to Christmas as well as the impact of clearance markdowns at the end of the holiday season. Margin mix was somewhat less favorable than the recent quarters, driven by strong sales in electronics. While below our expectations, fourth quarter U.S. segment gross margin rate was remarkably strong considering the team had to rapidly manage excess inventory in the middle of the quarter when we experienced a sudden change in the pace of sales following the data breach announcement.","Our fourth quarter U.S. segment SG&A rate was 18.4%, about 110 basis points above last year's revised rate. About 50 basis points of this headwind was related to the credit card portfolio reflecting a smaller asset base, last year's reserve release and this year's profit sharing arrangement with TD Bank. Another 20 basis points of headwind was driven by this year's change in member payments. The remaining unfavorability reflects the deleveraging effort of negative comp sales.","The fact that we experienced only 40 basis points of deleverage reflects strong control of variable expenses, given the magnitude of our comparable sales decline. In the Canadian segment, sales came in just below expectations. Importantly, as Gregg mentioned, we took advantage of holiday traffic to clear through a significant amount of excess inventory in the quarter. And while we expect some small lingering issues with long lean receipts this year, the Canadian segment ended 2013 in a much cleaner inventory position, paving the way for smoother operations in 2014. In all, the segment drove $0.40 of EPS dilution in the fourth quarter better than the expectations we provided in our January press release.","Turning now to our consolidated metrics, fourth quarter interest expense was 21% lower than last year reflecting the continued benefit of debt retirement funded by the proceeds from the sale of the credit card portfolio. We paid dividends of $0.43 per share in the quarter, an increase of more than 19% from fourth quarter 2012. This was our 185th consecutive quarter in which our company has paid a dividend and 2013 marked the 42nd year of annual dividend increases, a track record of few companies to match.","Consistent with last quarter, we didn't purchase any shares in the fourth quarter reflecting current performance and our desire to maintain our debt rating in the middle A range. This approach aligns with our longstanding point of view on capital deployment. First, we invest what we believe is appropriate in our core business. Second, we support the dividend which we've grown annually for more than four decades. And third, we use share repurchase to return cash within the limits of our middle A debt rating.","We believe a middle A rating is strategically important as it supports our ability to reliably deliver on our unbeatable pricing strategy over time. In addition, our balance sheet provides the flexibility to maintain our long-term focus in the face of unexpected events like the data breach enabling investment and strategic initiatives like flexible fulfillment while we deal with a temporary setback in traffic to sales along with other costs related to the breach.","In addition to operating results in the U.S. and Canada, our fourth quarter GAAP earnings reflects several items that reduced EPS by approximately $0.09. These items include charges related to our January restructuring, data breach related costs net of an insurance receivable and continued reduction in a beneficial interest asset partially offset by a small benefit from a resolution of income tax matters.","Combining fourth quarter results with performance in the first nine months of 2013 yields full year results that reflect the impact of clear successes and certain challenges. In our U.S. segment, full year comparable sales declined 0.4% well below our expectations going into the year. This reflects the tougher than expected consumer environment including the impact on the payroll tax increase which just annualized last month, the fourth quarter impact of the data breach and recent headwinds from unfavorable weather, as you've heard from many other retailers.","On our U.S. sales, we earned a gross margin rate of 29.8% in 2013, up about 10 basis points from 2012. This rate reflects about 20 basis points of benefit from this year's change in vendor payments combined with very strong underlying margin performance in the face of softer than expected sales. Throughout the year, Kathy's team did a great job managing inventory resulting in outstanding in-stock levels while avoiding unnecessary clearance markdowns.","Our full year SG&A expense rate in the U.S. was 20%, up about 90 basis points from last year's revised rate. Contrary to what you might initially think, this reflects outstanding performance in light of softer than expected sales and some notable challenges representing more than $600 million of incremental pressure. Including credit card portfolio income, which as you know reduces our SG&A rate, about $400 million lower than 2012 reflecting profit sharing with TD, prior year reserve reductions and a smaller asset base this year. And more than $200 million of expense pressure from incremental investments in technology and supply chain to support our multichannel efforts.","Without these impacts, our SG&A expense rate would have been slightly higher than 2012 but would have been neutral without this year's change in vendor payments. This is better expense performance than we'd expect on a decline in comparable sales and was driven primarily by two factors; outstanding performance by our stores organization which continued to provide outstanding guest service while delivering productivity increases and our company-wide expense optimization efforts through which our teams are finding better ways to work while deprioritizing less productive activities.","As Gregg mentioned, the team continues to find new opportunities to optimize expenses and we expect to reach $1 billion in annualized savings by 2015 helping to fund our efforts to drive profitable growth over the next several years. For full year 2013, U.S. REDcard penetration grew nearly 6 percentage points to 19.3% of sales as more and more guests increased their level of engagement and their spending with Target. Penetration in Kansas City where we began offering REDcard awards a year ahead of the rest of the country continued to run well ahead of the U.S. overall.","Importantly, as part of our broader effort to rebuild traffic and sales in 2014 we will work to reaccelerate REDcard growth in light of the recent slowdown in growth we've seen following the data breach. In Canada in 2013 we generated just over $1.3 billion in sales on 124 stores which were opened on average for a little more than half the year. These sales were well below our plan going into the year leading to greater than expected markdowns on a meaningful amount of excess inventory ","Expense rate were unusually high as well as a result of opening early cycle stores with too many payroll hours, incurring incremental expense relating to clearing inventory and experiencing less leverage on fixed expenses.","In the face of these challenges, the team worked tirelessly to improve operations and work through excess inventory throughout the year, clearing the way for an acceleration of sales and profitability beginning this year.","Our early cycle store continued to outperform later cycle stores giving is confidence that our operations will continue to become more efficient as our business matures. And having dramatically reduced the congestion in our Canadian supply chain, we will increase the intensity of our marketing message in 2014 regarding value and assortment in our frequency categories. Over time we expect this will lead our Canadian guests to choose Target more often in these categories, driving meaningful increases in traffic and sales.","Turning to capital deployment, our total capital investment was about $3.5 billion in 2013, somewhat lower than expected as U.S CapEx of about $1.9 billion was approximately $300 million lower than anticipated. This outcome doesn't reflect a change in strategy, but is simply the result of a lower than expected cost for certain projects and retiming of suspending into 2014.","Having sold our credit card portfolio, for about $5.7 billion in March, we significantly reduced our net debt position in 2013, including the early retirement of Haikupon debt. And importantly even in a year of peak CapEx and dilution relating to the Canadian segment combined with the impact of softer than expected U.S sales, we still have the capacity to return about $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.","With that as context, let's turn now to our outlook for 2014. But before we get to the numbers, I want to discuss a change in our reporting and guidance practices in 2014. Given that our Canadian segment is now fully operating, beginning with the first quarter of 2014 we will no longer exclude Canadian segment performance from adjusted EPS. To allow for appropriate comparison, last year's adjusted EPS will also reflect Canadian segment performance as well.","With that, let's turn to our full-year outlook beginning with sales. While trends have improved in recent weeks, severe winter weather has been a headwind and we continue to see the impact of the data breach on guest sentiment and traffic. We believe that we will continue to see muted trends in the next few months, but the breach impact will diminish throughout the year as we engage in a vigorous effort to address our guests\u2019 concerns and provide irresistible content offers driving business to our stores and digital channels.","In addition, while economic trends are improving, we continue to expect our lower and middle income guests to shop very cautiously in 2014. With that backdrop, our current view is that U.S comparable sales will grow in the range of 0% to 2% in 2014. On those sales we expect a U.S segment EBITDA rate of 10.1% to 10.3%, meaning EBITDA dollar should grow between 5% and 8% this year.","Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, we expect gross margin will improve 30 or 40 basis points from our 2013 rate of 29.8%, reflecting improved clearance markdown rates and more significantly the gross margin benefit of our expense optimization efforts. These benefits will be partially offset by the impact of additional promotional activities and continued investment in 5% REDcard rewards.","We expect the U.S segment SG&A expense rate slightly better than last year\u2019s 20% rate, reflecting continued discipline expense control and the benefit of our expense optimization efforts offset by our continued investments in distribution and technology in support of our multi-channel efforts. We expect these (indiscernible) investments to be worth $0.05 to $0.10 of incremental EPS pressure in 2014.","In Canada, we expect total sales will be approximately double our 2013 experience. As we annualize last year\u2019s124 openings and begin generating comparable sales growth in mature stores. On those sales we expect to earn a much higher gross margin rate in a range approaching 30%. But clearly we continue to see some near-term volatility until the Until the Canadian business matures.","While we expect to see better fixed expense leverage in 2014, the SG&A rate will likely remain well above our long-term outlook in a range approaching 40%. Altogether, this will lead to a Canadian segment EBITDA margin rate of minus 8% to minus 10%, representing more than $400 million of expected EBITDA improvement from 2013.","We expect U.S capital expenditures of $2.1 billion -- $2.3 billion, up slightly from actual 2013 spending. The mix of U.S CapEx will continue to tilt from investments in new stores towards supply chain and technology as we accelerate our multi-channel efforts and continue to find a limited number of new store sites that meet our strategic and financial criteria.","I should also note that U.S CapEx reflects incremental investments related to our recent decision to accelerate deployment of chip enabled card readers to all of our U.S stores before the end of the year. In Canada we expect 2014 capital expenditures in the $300 million to $400 million range, down more than $1 billion from peak spending in 2013.","We expect once again to raise our annual dividend in the neighborhood of 20% this year, which will mark our 43rd consecutive annual increase. And even with a temperate outlook for near-term traffic and sales and understanding there will be further costs relating to the data breach, our current outlook envision share repurchase capacity of $1 billion to $2 billion in 2014, beginning later in the year as our business stabilizes and we have more clarity on potential breach related costs.","Altogether, these expectations would lead to full-year adjusted EPS representing results from operations in the U.S and Canada of $3.85 to $4.15. This estimate excludes approximately $0.07 of dilution related to the continued reduction in the beneficial interest asset. These 2014 expectations represent an improvement of more than 20% from combined U.S and Canadian segment results in 2013.","Please note that our full-year outlook does not include potential additional costs relating to the data breach beyond what we already recorded in the fourth quarter, as they\u2019re not estimable at this time. While I realize this may result in a wide range of speculation on the magnitude of these costs, given that our investigation of breach is ongoing it would not be appropriate to say anything more about it than we already have this morning.","Regardless of the ultimate dollar amounts, as Greg mentioned, we have the financial strength to move beyond these near-term impacts while we continue to invest in the future. And as always, we are focused on what's most important, addressing the concerns of our guests and helping them to feel confident shopping with us.","Now let's briefly turn to our first quarter outlook. In the U.S we expect first quarter comparable sales in the range of flat to down 2%. So far in February comparable sales have been running within that range, ahead of our forecast and nearly flat to last year. And I should note while growth isn\u2019t running where it had been earlier in 2013, REDcard penetration so far in February has been running 100s of basis points ahead of last year.","On our first quarter U.S sales, we expect an EBITDA margin rate of 9.7% to 9.9%. In Canada, we expect to generate first quarter sales in a range of $400 million to $450 million with EBITDA of minus $150 million to minus $170 million.","In light of this near-term operating outlook, we don't expect to have the capacity to repurchase shares in the first quarter, but we expect to resume this activity later in the year. Altogether, our expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS reflecting operating results in the U.S and Canada in the range of $0.60 to $0.75, excluding $0.02 relating to the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any potential costs related to the data breach.","While this has been a challenging year, we are proud of the work of our team and we believe we have the right plans in place to generate meaningfully improved performance in 2014. As we focus on making Target irresistible for our guests, both today and over time, we believe we will go profitably for many years to come.","With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Greg, Kathy and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. On the same-store sales trends for February being down in that 0% to 2% range, probably little bit better than people expected. I guess you over time, Target has been on an aggressive campaign to drive frequency with REDcard and remodeling more stores towards food, but given that P Fresh is maturing here and the credit breach could curb some of the willingness to sign up for REDcard and online taking a bigger portion of the overall retail landscape. How should we think about some of the big initiatives or the big picture initiatives to drive same-store sales trends in 2014 and beyond?","Kathy Tesija","You know Sean, I think a lot of the things that I talked about today with product as well as with in-store experience and our mobile experience, those are really the key things for us to help drive people to shop at Target beyond the food that you talked about and of course the REDcard.","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then just on the food, I guess, aspect of things, how are you on the in-stocks in that particular category and are you happy with the product that you have out there on the shelf today?","Kathy Tesija","Yes, in-stocks have been rock solid for quite some time. In terms of products, I would tell you that we're always making adjustments to what we carry in-stores. We learn what selling and what trends are picking up steam, things like organics and better for your products. So that's a never-ending thing that we work on.","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray","Okay, great. And then just one last thing you mentioned the online and the flexible fulfillment, I think that all of those can now be viewed online which is great for the consumer, but when do you think or is it going to be possible for all of those products for buying online and picking up in-store?","Kathy Tesija","We are expanding the assortment right now. I don't have a date for you in terms of when we'll get our whole assortment up online. And right now we're focusing on the most popular items and categories that we recently added pets, for example, and we'll just continue to expand as we learn more and more about that program.","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot and good morning. I've got two questions and the first relates to inventory. I know you cleared a lot of inventory in Canada. Your year-on-year numbers still across the corporation, across the enterprise is still up quite substantially relative to sales. So if you could comment on sort of the composition of that inventory and your thought process for its impact on margin going forward?","Gregg Steinhafel","Sure. Inventory up about 10% year-over-year and you can roughly think about that split about equally between Canada and the U.S. Canada obviously we're just in a different place than we were a year ago. We built inventories all year as we opened stores. I would tell you in Canada we feel much, much better. We feel very good about the progress we made in the fourth quarter clearing excess inventory. The average inventory per store in Canada from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter was down about 30%. So we still have some lingering issues in Q1 with some long lean receipts but feel very good about the inventory there. In the U.S., I would tell you the merchant team did an outstanding job reacting to the change in sales and our inventories are in excellent shape. This is the time of year where in February we are changing lots of things in the store and frankly depending on where you snap the line for yearend relative to our receipts, we see inventory move around a little bit. If you go back over the past couple of years, our inventory per store in the U.S. is up about 3% versus two years ago. So this is really more timing than anything else and we feel very good about the inventory position.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up really is to capital allocation and specifically the buyback. I know that you alluded to the company's desire to maintain its current credit rating and that you spoke about resuming buybacks as the year progressed presuming that you are on plan. I just want to talk about what your thought process is for contingent fees? Based on the numbers we've looked at, it seems like you're a long way from coming close to the edge on your current credit rating. So what would it take for you not to do that $1 billion to $2 billion? It seems like that should be well within your financial capacity even if frankly the numbers are a bit light of your current guide?","Gregg Steinhafel","Well, we should go offline and review where you think we are versus our credit rating and where we think we are versus our credit rating. We've actually run pretty close to our credit rating not just last year, which was even higher, but for the past several years. So our view is that we think we can do, given our plans between $1 billion and $2 billion. We need to see our business results improve over the next couple of quarters. We're starting to see that in February as we alluded to. And then also get a little bit of a view into what the potential costs are that maybe coming our way as a result of the breach. But given all of that, we still think somewhere in $1 billion to $2 billion beginning probably in the back half of the year for the year makes sense.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just finally, I know you're not going to quantify the cost of the breach, but it sounds like and thinking about the capacity to buy back stock you have somewhere internally a sense of that number that would enable you to pursue that course?","Gregg Steinhafel","As we said, it's not estimable at this time what the potential cost of the breach is and given where we are in the process, it'd be inappropriate for me to speculate.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fair enough. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Hi. Thanks. I had a couple of questions. Just a quick follow-up on the breach costs. You showed a net, you got some insurance payments from the breach cost that you had. Should we expect that or do you have any insurance for these potential costs whatever they may be or is that sort of a one-off in the quarter? Then a follow-up.","Gregg Steinhafel","Just to be clear, that was insurance receivable, so we haven't actually received payment but we feel very likely to receive payment for a portion of the expenses we incurred in the fourth quarter. What we can say about insurance right now is at this point we think there's $44 million of insurance that we'll receive. And to the extent that number changes, we'll be back here to provide more information.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Okay, great. And a bigger picture on REDcard and traffic. I mean traffic was down 5.5% in the quarter. Presumably post the breach it was down \u2013 pick a number like 7% or 8%. Is it fair to say that traffic has recovered back to what it was in January and February where we are now and how is REDcard seasoning [ph]? Those people have now had it for three of four years, how are those people behaving following the breach? Thanks.","Gregg Steinhafel","Yes, on traffic you're view of what happened post the breach is pretty accurate and we have seen traffic continue to improve and firm up and definitely throughout February we've seen traffic firm up. And as we said, sales have improved and a big part of that has been traffic. On the REDcard what we've seen and Kathy talked about this a little bit, in our REDcard guest, they've continued to shop with us and we've seen very strong sales from that. REDcard penetration continues to grow meaningfully hundreds of basis points year-over-year. And to the extent we're not growing where we used to that's driven by new accounts. So the guests who have REDcards continue to shop our stores.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","So it's more of the penetration growth from new people signing up or from people that signed up shopping more?","Gregg Steinhafel","As has been the case over the past couple of year, the penetration growth comes from new accounts.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Thanks a lot. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securitie0073","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little more color on the top spreads that you're seeing between states that have been severely impacted by weather and some of your warmer weather states?","Gregg Steinhafel","Great question, Matt. It's analyzing weather isn't a perfect science. I would say when we see \u2013 in the Midwest, in the Northeast when we've seen these weather patterns go across the country, the spread is significant between the two. But ultimately as that passes, we see them re-stabilize and everything come back to normal. But the difference while it is going on is pretty dramatic. It's in single digits difference but it'd be high single digits.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks. And then secondly, you gave some great detail on your investments in digital and ecommerce this year. As you enable click and collect and fulfillment from store, are there any significant investments you need to make in terms of inventory, accuracy in the store and could you just give us maybe a bit of color on how that's running in terms of being able to pick up in-store?","Kathy Tesija","We're always working on inventory accuracy and that is a combination of how we use our systems as well as the processes in-store. And so it's been less of an issue to date as we get into some of the additional categories, things like beauty where there's a lot of SKUs, we got to make sure that the accuracy is there. I will tell you apparel, while we've had good results there, it's a little bit harder partly accuracy but partly being able to find the exact size when it's not in a planogrammed environment. So there are a few challenges for us to figure out, but overall I would tell you that our guest response has been very positive in the survey comments that they have back to us. They really love the service. So, yes, we will keep working on accuracy to make sure that we can fulfill as many orders as possible. But so far we're very pleased.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then lastly, your SG&A per foot in the U.S. was down pretty substantially in the fourth quarter versus the last few years. Well how should we think about SG&A per foot on a full-year basis for \u201914 in the U.S. should it -- is that a number that you can keep relatively flat or is there just some inherent inflation there that we should expect?","Gregg Steinhafel","First, the comparison to last year we have to be a little bit careful, there\u2019s a 53rd week in there that\u2019s a relatively low volume week which creates a little bit of distortion year-over-year. But I think, as I said we continue to work very hard on store productivity ensuring that we\u2019re driving great guest experience and in-stocks, but also improving our productivity. And then all of the expense optimization efforts continued to go on and some portion of that will fall to the bottom line, some portion of that goes to gross margin and some portion of that gets reinvested in the business as we invest in multi-channel technology supply chain. But I think flat to up slightly is probably about the best way to think about it.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. Good luck this year.","Gregg Steinhafel","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul with Nomura.","Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions, first on -- you gave a number on the online business in terms of the increase that you had in the fourth quarter?","Kathy Tesija","We didn\u2019t give a number, but I\u2019ll tell you it's very positive above the industry and slightly above 20%.","John Mulligan","Well I\u2019d be honest to the business, it was impacted by the breach as well.","Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities","Okay. And then, when you look at the full-year, actually pointing out you gave a lot of details, in terms of like the sales recovery that you have, what are the key factors that gave you the comfort and confidence in the recovery over this year as you plan the earnings and sales trajectory?","John Mulligan","Well, it's from our perspective we got to up our game on all fronts, it starts with delivering great content, great in-stocks, our team is more engaged than ever from a service standpoint both on the sales floor and at the lanes. And we\u2019re going to deliver as Kathy said just some eye popping irresistible deals. So we\u2019re going to really up the [ante] [ph] as it relates to making a statement on our unbeatable pricing proposition which we have. I mean we price matched the competition, and we run our circulars and with our 5% REDcard rewards program our pricing, our value proposition is unbeatable. So we\u2019re just going to call greater attention to that and selectively we\u2019re going to go out and be more aggressive in that regard. And so it's the combination of all of those elements.","Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities","And then on the gross margin outlook for Canada, can you just talk about the mix assumptions in there and sort of also like the ramp from where you finished fourth quarter to get to that 30% number for the year?","John Mulligan","Sure, mix in Canada continues to be stronger in apparel and home. And we expect that to moderate through time. We ultimately think the mix there will be stronger than what we see in the U.S. but a lot like our high volume stores in the U.S. our urbane stores in the U.S. we see a higher mix of home and apparel sales. That will moderate through time because we want to drive the frequency categories, that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on the team in Canada ultimately if they\u2019re successful in driving conversion and commodities, grocery, food all those categories we\u2019ll see that mix moderate. I think we\u2019ll see margin \u2013 we expect to see some volatility, Q1 for instance the margin rate won't be at 30%, but it will be significantly improved from the 4.4% we recorded in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019ll make progress and you should expect to see that throughout the year and of course back in fourth quarter next year we\u2019ll be down a little bit from that 30% as it's typical on our U.S. business given that time of year.","Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities","Great. Thank you very much.","Gregg Steinhafel","Okay, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities","Thanks and good morning. A couple of random questions, so could you perhaps breakout how much was the explicit impact of the 10% off deal that you did after the breach and right ahead of Christmas?","John Mulligan","Chris we don\u2019t breakout promotions individually, it was a big time of year and the number was relatively large but in the big scheme in the fourth quarter I would tell you it's not material.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities","Okay. And then on the cost savings side, I guess how much of the billion dollars is done so far and what has been the big drivers this year that have taken those costs out?","John Mulligan","There\u2019s $200 million that we recorded in 2014 we\u2019ll annualize on that next year. And the savings came from all over the corporation. There were savings in gross margin around transportation expenses that will grow again in 2014. There were savings really it's for it to pin it down, it was literally across the entire organization where we looked at things. We looked at how we sourced product and aligning our non-retail product that we source in services and making that look more like we do in merchandising and we saw significant savings there from our sourcing. There\u2019s more to do there and we\u2019ll see that grow in 2014 as well. But as Gregg said it was literally across the entire organization where we were focused on stopping things that we didn\u2019t need to do, I mean if we did need to do them improving productivity.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities","And then, one last one; how would have the \u2013 if you had chip technology in your stores this past year how would the breach outcomes change, would it stop the actual CES to the credit card data or would it stop the personal information disclosure?","John Mulligan","The chip technology makes it such that using the account numbers without the card becomes very, much more difficult. And so the desire to obtain those card numbers goes down significantly. What we\u2019ve seen in other countries that have adopted chip technology as fraud rates go down dramatically for in-store transactions. I think in the U.K. or Europe I can\u2019t remember exactly down like 60%, once chip technology was enabled. And so the desire, those account numbers just become less desirable.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities","But didn\u2019t the breach actually come from systems internally not necessarily coming from the card readers.","Gregg Steinhafel","Yes, Chris we\u2019re in the middle of an investigation and we can\u2019t talk about the specifics. We continue to learn, there\u2019ll be learning\u2019s that come out of that investigation and from those learning\u2019s we\u2019ll take actions and that\u2019s about what we can say today.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities","Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Gregg Steinhafel","Okay. Well, that concludes Target\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Thank you all for your participation.","Operator","Again thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"20441":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call August 17, 2016  8:00 AM ET","Executives","John Hulbert - Vice President, Investor Relations","Brian Cornell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","John Mulligan - Chief Operating Officer","Cathy Smith - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","David Schick - Consumer Edge Research","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Company","Kate McShane - Citi","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 17, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Brian will recap our second quarter performance, including results across our merchandise category. Then John will provide an update on our efforts to improve in-stocks and modernize our supply chain. And finally, Cathy will offer more detail on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.","Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS from continuing operations and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his comments on the second quarter and our priorities going forward. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter comparable sales decline of 1.1% was near the middle of our guidance range for the quarter, but well below the results we expect to deliver over time. Against that backdrop, we reported much stronger than expected profitability. This outperformance was driven by our ongoing cost saving efforts, which benefited both our gross margin and expense rates in the second quarter. These benefits helped to offset pressure from the current promotional environment, declining comp sales, and the investments we are making in our team. I want to pause and thank our team for delivering this outstanding financial performance.","At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are committed, first and foremost, to restoring positive comp sales growth in the quarters and years ahead. Based on the conversations with many of you, we know there is a great deal of focus on the broad macro challenges facing retailers, including a consumer focused on experiences, the impact of price deflations, and a channel shift into digital. These are real challenges, but they are not new to our business. With the right strategy and strong execution, we have demonstrated our ability to perform in the face of those challenges and our expectation is that we will continue to be a top retail performer over time.","In the second quarter, our number one challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories. And consistent with the first quarter, we saw higher than normal variability in sales patterns. Despite these challenges, we are encouraged that we saw the strongest sales performance around key second quarter events, including Memorial Day, The Fourth of July, and the beginning of the back-to-school season.","As we analyze the drivers to our second quarter performance, we have identified some company-specific challenges we are actively addressing. This includes meaningful pressure on electronics, where we saw a double-digit decline in comp sales this quarter, accounting for approximately 70 basis points of overall comp decline. Notably, about a third of this pressure was driven by Apple products, which are down more than 20% in the quarter. We are focused on reversing these trends and we are collaborating with Apple and other vendor partners to evolve our assortment and accelerate innovation to deliver stronger sales.","In grocery, despite improvements in assortments, quality, freshness, presentation, and in-stocks, we were disappointed with our sales performance as we saw small comp sales decline in the second quarter. While our grocery business was negatively impacted by food deflation, which accounted for about 20 basis points of pressure, we clearly have more work to do to unlock the growth potential in this important category. Given our recent performance and the increasingly competitive food environment, we are revisiting our second half grocery efforts from presentation to assortment to promotion to improve our competitive position.","And as I will discuss in a few minutes, we will be leveraging our learning from our LA25 remodels to help guide our plans going forward. Beyond food, we are rebalancing our messaging and promotions to ensure we continue to drive strong performance in style categories and reach consumers who are intently focused on value in this environment. Finally, we experienced soft second quarter traffic trends in the pharmacies in our stores as we completed the re-branding transition from Target to CVS across the country. The execution of transition went very smoothly and we have been very pleased with the level of collaboration between our teams and our partners at CVS. While it\u2019s not surprising that the re-branding activity has resulted in some near-term disruption, we are focused on restoring growth in this traffic-driving area in our stores. As a result, we are working closely with our partners at CVS as they launch media, marketing, and member engagement campaigns to increase awareness and utilization of CVS pharmacies in our stores.","In addition, CVS is executing an in-store engagement campaign and plans to offer special flu shot incentives at the pharmacies in our stores. As we take steps to increase awareness of the CVS-Target partnership, both of them, our guests and members of the CVS PBM business, we expect to reaccelerate pharmacy traffic in our stores over time. Despite this quarter\u2019s challenges, we are pleased that the fundamental elements of our strategy are continuing to shape our results. Comparable sales in signature categories continue to lead the company, reflecting investments we have made in quality, presentation, and marketing.","In the second quarter, comp sales growth in these categories outpaced the company by approximately 3 percentage points. Within signature, we saw particular strength in both kids and style. Results in kids reflected the launch of Cat & Jack, which is now positioned to become our biggest own brand. After the July rollout of this brand, we saw double-digit growth in Cat & Jack sales when measured against comparable sales of Circo and Cherokee last year.","Within style, we continue to benefit from strength in women\u2019s apparel. We saw mid-single-digit comp increase in the quarter. This performance was driven by double-digit growth in our Xhilaration brand, which is focused on a younger style savvy guest. In addition, we are really pleased with the performance of Who What Wear, which is one of the most productive brands on our women\u2019s floor pad. As a result, we are expanding the range of this assortment for the fall, inviting more of our guests to enjoy the items from this fashion forward collaboration.","Digital sales grew more than 60% in the second quarter on top of 30% growth last year. We continue to invest in Target\u2019s digital assets to enhance the guest experience and drive sales in all channels, and our results demonstrate the impact of the investments we have made over time. For example, several years ago, we told you we had an opportunity to improve our digital conversion. Since then, we have invested to improve our conversion performance by streamlining online checkouts, making the site more appealing and easy to use, enhancing our personalization capabilities and improving search. As a result, for several years in a row, we have seen meaningful improvement in our digital conversion across all platforms, particularly in mobile. In the second quarter, we launched a brand new fully adapted site, which means we now provide a seamless experience across all platforms from desktop to tablets to smartphones. This is increasingly important because for many guests, a single purchase journey crosses over two or more of these digital devices.","We are really pleased with the results in our new flexible format stores, which are designed for very dense driven and suburban neighborhoods. These stores allow us to operate in areas we have never been able to serve with our largest format stores, allowing us to extend our reach to consumers with high affinity for our brand. In July, we opened up new flex-format stores in Washington Square in Philadelphia, Lincoln Park in Chicago, Commonwealth in Boston, and Forest Hills in Queens. We are excited to be serving guests in these iconic neighborhoods and the guest response to these new locations has been fantastic.","Financially, flexible formats are very successful. The sales productivity is much higher than our company average, and they have been meeting or exceeding our profit targets. In total this year, we are planning to open 14 flex-format stores, including a multilevel location in Tribeca this October.","Based on our experience to-date and our investments and capability, we are increasingly confident in our ability to successfully open and operate stores in a variety of neighborhood settings across the country. As a result, we are accelerating our pipeline of locations we can open in future years and we expect flex-format stores to be a key driver of future growth. In our existing stores, we continue to invest in presentation and experience, particularly in signature categories.","We completed the remodeling of our LA25 test stores in the second quarter and we are in the early stages of a robust learning plan to measure guest reaction to the changes we have made. Overall, we are encouraged by initial results in these stores and we are already rolling out some of the innovations from these stores more broadly. Namely, we are pleased with the presentation and innovation in home and apparel and results from our work to elevate the order pickup experience. So we are already extending these innovations beyond the LA market.","In addition, the changes we have made to the food area in the LA25 test stores has really resonated with guests. Grocery sales in these stores are trending 2 to 3 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. Relative performance in produce is even stronger, driving perishable comps that are more than 5 percentage points higher than the comparison stores. Guests have told us the new food area now feels more intimate and separate from the rest of the store, providing a distinct grocery shopping experience they prefer. We are very encouraged with these initial observations and we will continue to leverage learning from these stores as we work to improve grocery performance across the chain.","We were fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates a lot of cash even in challenging times. This cash allows us to make long-term investments in our business while returning cash to our shareholders at the same time. In June, we announced that our Board had approved a 7.1% increase in our quarterly dividend, supporting our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. In addition, our cash position allowed us to return well over $1 billion through share repurchase in the second quarter in support of our goal to return $3.5 billion or more this year.","Looking ahead, we are very excited about the back-to-school and back-to-college season, which is second only to the fourth quarter holiday season in terms of importance. In back-to-school, we continue to work with kids and parents who inform our product design and development process. So it\u2019s only natural that this year, we engaged with kids to design and execute our back-to-school marketing campaign. Kids led all aspects of this campaign drafting storyboards, illustrating creative content, directing the spots and performing the music. To make shopping fast and convenient for busy families, this year we partnered with teacherslist.com to make nearly 1 million school supply lists available with our School List Assist tool on target.com. This tool allows parents to quickly and seamlessly purchase supplies of their kid\u2019s class list, arrange for store pickup or have the items delivered directly to their home.","In back-to-college, our marketing campaign is designed around today\u2019s students, which are digital natives. In this campaign, we are partnering with three recent graduates to create inspiring, do-it-yourself videos to college students make their new dorm room or apartment feel like home. In addition, we have provided tools to make college shopping convenient and fun including college registry, order pickup, subscriptions and special offers on Cartwheel. As we have done for more than 15 years, we are hosting back-to-college after-hours shopping events, which will take place at 85 colleges and universities in the next couple of months. In these events, we provide free bus transportation from campus and provide students the opportunity to stock up and save on everything they will need for school.","I want to pause here and mention how happy we are to have Mark Tritton on the Target team. Mark took on the role of Chief Merchandising Officer in the second quarter. And he spent the last couple of months getting to know his team and becoming immersed in our business. Mark is creative and passionate about retail. He has had an amazing career building iconic brands. And I am confident he will be able to grow with our own brands and our Target brand. Mark is planning to speak on this conference call next quarter when he will outline our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday season.","We continue to believe we are focused on the right strategic priorities and we are confident in our ability to grow profitably over time. We believe it\u2019s appropriate to update our sales and EPS outlook for the remainder of the year. Our decision is informed by the retail sales environment and the variability we continue to see in our weekly and regional results. While we are laser focused on accelerating traffic and sales, it\u2019s prudent to build near-term business and inventory plan that are consistent with recent trends. As always, we will be prepared to flex those plans upward if results begin to recover in the second half of the year.","Before I turn the call over to John, I want to spend a second with a special thank you to our team and our stores. I visit our stores around the country nearly every week and I am so grateful to have a group of such smart and friendly team members serving our guests. John\u2019s team in headquarters is focused on ways to simplify our processes, modernize our supply chain and help to ensure our stores feature the right assortment of items that are in stock every day. When we backed up an outstanding team with the right business fundamentals, we offer an unparalleled experience in retail.","With that, I will turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on his team\u2019s efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks Brian. Good morning everyone. As Brian just mentioned, our store teams do an outstanding job serving our guests every day. It\u2019s long been a key point of differentiation for our brand. What I didn\u2019t fully appreciate until I came into my new role as COO was the workload that our supply chain processes have been driving into our stores. Historically, when we design processes to improve upstream efficiencies in our supply chain, we often achieve those benefits by moving work and complexity into our stores. One of the key priorities in my new team has been to look at the entire supply chain and find ways to optimize it end to end to deliver reliability for our guests while driving efficiency for the organization as a whole. A key measure of reliability is our ability to stay in stock and I am pleased that we continue to see improvement even as we begin to compare against improvements from a year ago.","In stores, as we entered the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons, Target\u2019s overall out of stock position was better than we have ever measured historically. In addition, out of stocks on frequency and commodity items, the items which reliability is most important for our guests are in an even stronger position. And in the digital channel, while we have much work yet to do, we have already reduced out of stocks by more than 50% in the last six months. Our work to reduce variability in our distribution centers has been one of the drivers of these improvements. In the past, an unacceptable number of vendor shipments were received by our DCs either too early or too late. This variability drove a lot of extra workload in the DCs while reducing our reliability downstream. As a result this year, we have been collaborating with our vendors to increase the percent of shipments that arrive on the correct date and we have already seen meaningful progress. The percent of shipments that arrive on time has more than doubled and we expect to see additional improvement as we roll out new processes to additional vendors over time.","As shipments arrive at our distribution centers, we have made changes to the prioritization of inbound processing, which have already cut the time to unload trailers by more than 50% and we believe we can cut that time even further. In addition, we have improved process flow between our import warehouses and our regional DCs, reducing the average time it takes for an item in an import warehouse to reach the store shelves by more than half. We are also focused on our outbound processing with the goal of enabling daily deliveries to every store throughout the week regardless of a store sales volume. When implemented, this change will drive additional improvements to store in-stocks while reducing backroom inventory and store workload. I want to thank the entire team from merchandise planning to our distribution centers, logistics teams and our stores for these improvements. Without the engagement of the entire end to end supply chain, we couldn\u2019t have made such amazing progress.","Before I move on to our work in the stores, I want to comment briefly on our overall inventory position. As we have mentioned over the last several quarters, a portion of our year-over-year inventory growth reflects intentional investments we are making in non-seasonal commodity categories to support in-stock improvement on items most important our guests. In addition, our second quarter inventory reflected an investment to offer additional items in certain categories as we work with merchant teams to reliably offer appropriate assortment, both online and in our stores, to best serve our guests. Beyond our upstream supply chain work, our investment in self checkout lanes is also reducing store workload, freeing up time for our store teams to focus on guest service, while providing our guests with checkout option that many of them prefer. As of today, we have self checkout in just over 1,000 of our stores. We are planning to add it to another 200 stores by the end of the year and we will continue the rollout in 2017. In stores with self checkout, nearly a third of transactions go through these lanes, much higher than our initial projections. Our flexible fulfillment initiatives, including store pickup and ship-from-store are one way we are reinvesting store labor savings to serve guests in new ways. At the end of 2015, more than 460 stores were shipping items directly to guest homes and we are planning to double our capacity this year by expanding this capability to more than 500 additional stores. These additional locations will further improve our average ship time while providing deeper access to our store inventories increasing the likelihood that we can ship a guest\u2019s entire order from a single nearby store location. And importantly, because we are now pre-positioning high velocity web-only items in the backroom, a ship-from-store locations, we are able to reduce last mile and split shipment expenses dramatically.","In-store pickup is an increasingly popular option for many of our guests. This year, we have seen 50% growth in pickup orders on top of 60% growth a year ago. Year-to-date more than 90% of our pickup orders have been ready in 1 hour and we have implemented process improvements to reduce wait times in stores. As a result, guest satisfaction with the pickup experience is up from a year ago and a higher percent of guests are repeatedly using this service.","To prepare for this holiday season surge, we are investing to ensure our stores can continue to deliver a great pickup experience in the face of rapidly increasing demand. In 75 of our highest volume stores, we are increasing holding capacity to allow our team to retreat items more quickly even during peak times. We are also investing in additional digital devices to support peak demand and across all of our stores. We are rolling out new guidance on how our stores can optimize their storage space to enhance speed and efficiency. New this year, we have implemented systems and processes to allow stores to forecast and monitor pickup demand ensuring we maintain proper staffing levels. In addition, during the holiday season, about 300 stores will be testing separate branded shirts for the team members in the pickup area and distinctive bags for pickup orders to underscore our commitment to this experience.","Finally, as Brian mentioned, back-to-school, back-to-college season is our second most important sales driver of the year. As a result, we are planning to carefully measure our pickup reliability and speed during promotional peaks this quarter, so we can apply those learnings in time for the holiday season when peak demand will be even higher. It was just a year ago that I began working with my new team. I am very proud of what we have accomplished since then. However, I am also energized by the opportunities still ahead of us to further increase the speed, flexibility and reliability of our supply chain, to drive unnecessary workload out of our stores and to enable operational excellence across the organization. As we work to accomplish these goals, I am fortunate to work with an experienced team, led by both internal talent and some amazing new hires and I am confident that with their leadership, we will continue to improve Target\u2019s operations on behalf of our guests.","With that, I will turn it over to Cathy who will share her insights on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks, John and hello everyone. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 was better than the high end of our guidance and just better than last year. Second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.16 lower than adjusted EPS, driven by $0.17 of debt retirement costs due to settlement timing on a subset of our first quarter debt tender offers.","This quarter\u2019s profit performance was quite impressive in light of the challenging sales environment. Specifically, comparable sales declined 1.1% this quarter, in line with our guidance and well below our plan at the beginning of the year. As expected, the total sales in the second quarter were down more than 7% from last year driven by the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS. Digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, contributing 0.5 points of our comparable sales growth.","Looking at the components of our comparable sales, comp transactions declined 2.2% partially offset by a 1.1% increase in average ticket. While ticket growth was broadly consistent with the last couple of years, traffic performance showed a meaningful change from prior trend. I want to pause and make it clear that we are not satisfied with our second quarter traffic and sales performance. And as Brian described earlier, we are taking steps to grow both our traffic and sales over time.","REDcard penetration was 23.9% in the first quarter, up about 180 basis points from last year. However, given that last year\u2019s pharmacy sales had a much lower than average REDcard penetration, the removal of those sales from this year\u2019s results drove a portion of the penetration improvement. Excluding that benefit, REDcard penetration was up about 70 basis points from a year ago.","Moving down the P&L, our second quarter EBITDA margin rate was 11.2%, up about 30 basis points from 10.9% a year ago. This improvement was entirely driven by a year-over-year increase in our gross margin rate partially offset by a modest increase in our SG&A expense rate. Among the drivers of our gross margin rates, the pharmacy sales drove about 70 basis points of improvement from last year. This improvement was offset by pressure from shipping expense resulting from online growth, along with the impact of second quarter promotional and clearance markdowns partially offset by the benefits of our cost control efforts.","On the SG&A line, we saw pressure from investments in our team and in marketing along with the de-leveraging impact of the decline in sales. These pressures were offset by the rate impact of the pharmacy sale combined with the benefit of our cost savings initiatives. Overall, we saw a year-over-year increase in our SG&A expense rate of about 20 basis points. Given the pressures we were facing, this is really impressive expense performance and I want to thank the team for their tireless efforts to control costs.","Quarter end inventory was up a little more than 4% consistent with last quarter. Given the investments we have made in essential categories and assortment enhancements as well as the impact of the sales slowdown that occurred in the second quarter, our quarter end inventory position was relatively healthy. And of course, given our cost of sales outlook for the back half of the year, we will continue to monitor our receipts and inventory levels closely.","Let\u2019s now turn to capital deployment. As we mentioned in our last conference call, this quarter we deployed about $1 billion to settle a portion of our first quarter debt tenders \u2013 tender offers and we funded a $750 million debt maturity in July. In addition, during the quarter, we returned another $1.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends of $330 million and share repurchase of more than $1.3 billion. By the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet, consistent with the guidance we provided in our first quarter conference call.","One other note, through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased approximately $8.8 billion of shares under the company\u2019s current $10 billion repurchase authorization. As a result, we plan to request additional repurchase capacity from our board in the next several months. Given that our outlook anticipates continued cash available for share repurchase going forward.","I want to reiterate that our priorities for capital deployment have not changed. First, we fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and intend to build on our 45-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we return cash by repurchasing shares when we have the capacity within the limits of our A long-term credit rating. Looking ahead, we will continue to govern the pace and magnitude of share repurchase in support of our goal to maintaining those credit ratings.","Despite the challenging environment, our business continues to generate very strong returns. For the 12-month period through second quarter, we reported an after-tax return on invested capital of 15.8%, up from 13.3% a year ago. I will quickly note, however, that this year\u2019s ROIC includes the one-time gain from the sale of our pharmacy business to CVS, which occurred last December. Without that one-time benefit, our second quarter after-tax ROIC was still a very healthy 13.7%, up about 40 basis points from last year.","Before I turn to our outlook, I want to pause and discuss the factors that are shaping our expectations going forward. Obviously, one consideration is the sales and traffic environment we have faced over the last several months, in which overall trends have been challenging and weekly and regional patterns have been more variable than normal. The second consideration pertains to the relative benefit of planning our business conservatively. If actual sales turn out to be stronger than our expectations, our teams are prepared to chase inventories and ramp up hours in our stores and distribution centers. In those situations, we generally generate healthy profit rates on incremental sales. However, those same profit dynamics typically work in reverse when we miss our sales outlook, given that it\u2019s more difficult to cancel orders and to pull back on labor hours. So despite the fact that we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and we are taking steps to address some of the company specific challenges Brian addressed earlier, we believe it\u2019s appropriate to temper our near-term sales and EPS expectations.","So let\u2019s turn first to our outlook for the third quarter, beginning with sales. This quarter, we are planning for a comparable sales range of a minus 2% to flat, consistent with our second quarter guidance. If our comp sales are near the midpoint of that range, we expect to generate gross margin and SG&A expense rates similar to last year\u2019s level. This expectation reflects the continued benefit from the removal of the pharmacy sales from this year\u2019s results, offset by a continuation of the headwinds we faced in the second quarter.","One note, the pharmacy sales is expected to cause a delta of a little more than 6 percentage points between comp sales and total sales this quarter, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. As a result, we expect to de-leverage depreciation and amortization line in the third quarter as the depreciation and amortization dollars are expected to be essentially flat to last year, but spread over a smaller sales base.","Altogether in the third quarter, we expect to generate both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.95. As we look beyond the third quarter, we are planning fourth quarter comp sales in the same range as third quarter. And given our third and fourth quarter profit outlook, combined with our year-to-date performance through the second quarter, we are planning to generate full year adjusted EPS of $4.80 to $5.20. We expect full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be about $0.44 lower than adjusted EPS as a result of the debt retirement and pharmacy transaction costs, which we recorded in the first half of the year. While this outlook for full year EPS is somewhat lower than our expectation at the beginning of the year, it reflects healthy profit performance in the face of challenging sales. And consistent with our performance through the first half of the year, it reflects the benefit of our cost savings initiatives and disciplined management by our team.","Before I conclude my remarks, I want to thank the team for making cost control a long-term habit, not a short-term focus. Last year, we announced a plan to save $2 billion over 2 years and I am pleased to say that we are not only running ahead of that goal, but the team continues to find new opportunities to eliminate unnecessary costs and activities. These savings allow us to reinvest resources in our enterprise priorities while still generating solid financial performance even in challenging times.","With that, we will conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning. My first and primary question relates to how much of impact do you think the CVS pharmacy transition had on traffic, did you see that dynamic deteriorate from the first quarter, and is there a way to qualify perhaps how much you feel like the spillover effect from that would have impacted the overall comp?","Brian Cornell","Matt, as I discussed in my prepared comments, our traffic was impacted by a number of factors, including CVS. So we certainly saw a slowdown in our pharmacy operations. We are working closely with CVS to launch some new marketing campaigns to win back our Target guests and certainly to begin to unlock the potential of their PBM network. So that\u2019s certainly played a role. But we also had other factors that we are focused on right now. We are not pleased with the performance we saw in food despite making some really good progress in presentation, improving our assortment, and certainly, the freshness to our products. So our number one focus as we sit here today is driving traffic back to our stores and accelerating visits to our site. And addressing the pharmacy impact is just one of the variables we are focused on today.","Matt Fassler","Thank you for that. And by the way a quick follow-up, a different topic, you touched on Apple products down over 20%, we are obviously in the middle of a bit of pause between iPhone releases leading up to one most likely later this year, is the Apple softness, at this point, really an iPhone story or is it a broader issue across the product suite?","Brian Cornell","Matt for us, it\u2019s a broader story across the product suite. And one of the first things we have had Mark Tritton do was actually spend time with our Apple partners really making sure that we are putting the right plans together for the back half of the year, that we are ready to capitalize on their new innovation that they will be bringing to market. But again, as we think about factors that we have to address to improve our traffic and overall sales performance to the back half of the year, we have to improve electronic performance. It was a significant drag, 70 basis points on our overall comp declines in the quarter, and Apple played a significant role there. So we over indexed with Apple products. Our guests come to us looking for those products. They are looking for the newness and the innovation, and we are putting together plans with Apple and our merchandising teams to make sure we are ready to take advantage of that in the back half of the year.","Matt Fassler","Brian, thank you very much.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Your next question is from David Schick from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead with your question.","David Schick","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Brian Cornell","Good morning David.","David Schick","My question is on the competitive environment, you talked about all the different things you are working on with traffic, but is there anything out there that you are seeing \u2013 anything you could highlight sort of in the major categories that\u2019s going on in the marketplace that might be affecting your \u2013 either your traffic or your customers\u2019 attention and how you are thinking about addressing that in the back half?","Brian Cornell","Well Matt, I think we have seen this environment persist now for well over a year. It\u2019s a very cautious consumer. And if we look at the overall trends within retail, we have certainly seen on a rolling 12-month basis a slowdown in retail sales growth, but that\u2019s not an excuse for us. We are going to make sure we are leveraging our strategic levers. We continue to make sure we improve our in-store experience. As John talked about during the call, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we offer a sensational in-store pickup experience and also make sure that our site is easier to work with and allows us to ship directly to home. So we are going to make sure we are leveraging the key components of our strategy. I feel really good about the progress we have made in store in preparation for back-to-school and back-to-college. I have been out into a number of markets. I don\u2019t think our stores have ever looked better, so it\u2019s a competitive environment. It\u2019s going to continue to be a competitive environment, and we\u2019re got to make sure that we leverage our strategy, make sure that we are bringing the best of our signature categories and bringing the value the guest is looking for in core household essentials to win trips and win back trips in the second half of the year. So it\u2019s competitive, but it\u2019s always competitive, and we\u2019ve got make sure that we are leveraging our assets and our strategy to continue to drive performance in the back half of the year.","David Schick","I guess a follow-up to that would be, it\u2019s competitive as you say, it continues to be competitive, is there any change in the balance of whether its new products of merchandising or pathways brought to market or pricing, anything changing in the way of the competitive environment for you to make \u2026?","Brian Cornell","David, you have used an important term that I have been using internally and that is balance or rebalancing. And as I look at my experience now over the last couple of years at Target, we are best when we balance both ends of our brand positioning. We have got to deliver on the Expect More component. And I think we have done a sensational job there. Our progress in apparel and home has been really significant, and we\u2019ve got to make sure we never lose track of the other side of our brand promise and that\u2019s the Pay Less side. And that\u2019s all about those core household essentials that we have to make sure are presented effectively in store, in our circular, on our end caps to our guests each and every week. So as we think about the back half of the year and the keys to driving our business going forward, we are going to have both of those levers in balance. We have got to continue to make sure our signature categories and particularly those in important style categories, continue to connect with our guests and we have got to deliver great value through household essentials, those everyday products that drive that Target run, so that balance or rebalance is critically important to the actions we are taking in the back half of the year.","David Schick","Thanks so much.","Brian Cornell","Thanks David.","Operator","Your next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Oliver Chen","Hi. We had a question regarding the dynamics you are seeing between fill-in and stock-up trips. How are you feeling about that in your research? And also as we look towards the back half and model our views on comp store sales, what would you prioritize as the biggest drivers to improve traffic in terms of the different initiatives that you are pursuing in light of what you are seeing? And just another question we had is why do you think this happened in pharmacy in terms of what was the consumer experiencing in your store that made the transition a little more disruptive than you would have wanted? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Yes. Oliver, let me try to break apart those three questions and have Cathy and John jump in as appropriate. As we think about the rebalancing and the work that we are doing from a merchandising standpoint, an in-store presentation standpoint and also a weekly advertising standpoint, we recognized we have to continue to deliver the right presentation for that stockification and particularly in the back half of the month, have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right availability of the items our guest is looking for in that fill-in occasion. So, we are activating and ensuring we put those changes in place to find the balance as we speak today. So, we are certainly very focused and aware of the fact that we have to win on both fronts. We better have the right assortment for that stock-up occasion and we need to make sure we have the right pack price architecture to meet the needs of the guests during that fill-in occasion. So, we are very focused on that.","From a CVS standpoint, I will let John jump in here. It\u2019s not a surprise to us that there has been some disruption. And I think for all of us on the call, we know what it\u2019s like when we change a pharmacy prescription and move from one provider to another. And while they are staying in our location, they have got to sign up for some new programs. They are entering a new environment. There is some time that, that\u2019s going to take, but we have been very pleased. John has been working with his CVS counterparts on the transition. We have had great collaboration, great partnership. We are starting to activate the marketing and the personalized messaging and we expect over time we will see that business accelerate and we expect pharmacy and the partnership to be a future driver of traffic and growth. But John, why don\u2019t you talk about some of the things we are doing at the store level with CVS?","John Mulligan","Yes, I think I would start by first echoing what Brian said. We talked going into the deal we had a great partner and it\u2019s certainly what we had observed through the transition here. It\u2019s been a great partner to work with. Our teams have worked together very well to transition. We have done the best job we can in transitioning guests, but as Brian said, change is change. And sometimes you just need to work through that. From a go-forward perspective, we are working with CVS certainly on some of their capabilities that they will bring to bear for Target. And as Brian said unlock their PBM network into our stores, but more importantly, day to day in the stores, we see great guest service \u2013 continue to see great guest service from our pharmacists. CVS would note that probably the best course they have ever seen in a transition like this and then starting to work with them to engage the pharmacy more back into the store through things like the opportunity here at back-to-school, back-to-college with flu shots and having the pharmacy play a more prominent role as we go forward. And so the teams continue to develop plans like that. They are very focused on it. We are focused on it. And we are very excited about the opportunity here as we continue to move forward.","Cathy Smith","Hey, Oliver, this is Cathy. I will add a little bit more too around priorities for driving traffic in the back half and we are really excited, because we go into this part of the year where we have a lot of events and that\u2019s where Target really have some great plans. We always have great plans, back-to-school, back-to-college. We are excited about, obviously, the launch of Cat & Jack has started out very successfully with a lot of learnings that we took away from Pillowfort, both online and in stores. And then, obviously, we go into our primetime. And so standing tall on the events that we typically have always done but we are really well positioned and then it\u2019s the things that Brian and John have already mentioned the rebalancing of our messaging. We are re-looking at all of our grocery efforts around presentation assortment and promotions of the electronics, the newness that Brian mentioned and then obviously the work that got John just said around CVS.","Brian Cornell","Yes. So, Oliver, as we think about the second half, we have got to continue to build on the things that are working today. Even in a challenging second quarter, we grew market share in the important apparel space. We saw very strong results in our home categories. We continue to be a destination for toys. So, we have had to build on the things that are working and ensure that we are also winning trips for those core household essentials. So, we will be focusing on rebalancing, on leveraging the improvements we have made, both in-store with our in-store pickup process and also online and we are not altering our strategic focus. It\u2019s making sure we get our strategies in balance and we deliver against both signature categories and those important household essentials that drive traffic to our stores and put cars in the parking lot.","Oliver Chen","Thank you very much. Best regards.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Oliver.","Operator","Your next question is from Kate McShane with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Kate McShane","Hi, good morning.","Brian Cornell","Good morning.","Kate McShane","I think when you gave guidance for Q2 originally it was because of some of the higher inventories that you flagged at other channels, especially with regards to apparel. So, I was just wondering how much you think you are benefiting from the weakness that we have seen at the brick-and-mortar department stores, especially when considering women\u2019s apparel comp was up mid single-digits during the quarter?","Brian Cornell","Well, we certainly think we are winning in the apparel space and I think a lot of that\u2019s really driven by the changes we have made, the improvement in our assortment, in quality and being more on trend with some of our fashion assortment. I talked about Xhilaration performing very well in the quarter. Who What Wear continues to be a real winner for us in connecting well with our guests. And we have also matched that up with an improved in-store experience. And we have been talking about mannequins for a while, but the role that our visual merchandisers are playing, the investment that John and I made last year to ensure we had not only mannequins and home vignettes, but the talent in our stores to maintain that experience 52 weeks a year is certainly connecting with the guests. So, we think we are benefiting by really executing against the strategy we have been talking about for several years making sure we have the right quality, innovation, presentation in our stores and we surround our guests with great service and that\u2019s paying off with market share gains in a challenging environment, where we continue to see improvement in our apparel and home assortments.","Kate McShane","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Cornell","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Melich","Good morning. I want to follow-up a bit on traffic and then get into the guidance a bit. On traffic, I think about it a different way, I think about a year ago, traffic had recovered nicely to say up 1%. And overall, retail sales were growing roughly where they were if you just look at the government data and now the traffic is obviously down a couple of percent. Do you see any differences in terms of geographies or other things going on income demographics around your stores where that traffic trend is different, just looking at the last 12 months?","Brian Cornell","Yes, Greg, we certainly do. And Cathy and I talked about this at the end of the first quarter. We have seen quite a bit of variability on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis between different markets. We have seen particular strength in many of our West Coast markets, very strong performance in California, driven by great performance in LA and San Francisco, but other parts of the West Coast. We have seen pockets of softness on the East Coast. And we have really tried to make sure market by market, we are looking at those dynamics, looking at the competitive dynamics, understanding what we can leverage from the markets, where we are seeing increases like Los Angeles and bring that into challenged markets. But we have seen over the course of this year in 2016, much more variability than I have seen in many, many years. So, we are drilling down on that. And as we think about our plans for the second half of the year, we are building market-specific action plans to make sure we address the market-specific needs of our stores and our guests.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s helpful. And then Cathy, I think on the margins, just want to make sure I got the guidance right. If I take the midpoint, I get to the \u2013 you mentioned the third quarter flat EBIT margins although I imagine next to the CVS sale, they would be done like 30 bps in the fourth quarter. Is that right?","Cathy Smith","Yes. So, it\u2019s slightly down EBIT margin. We said gross margin SG&A about where they were last year.","Greg Melich","Got it. But for the fourth quarter, does the guidance imply that EBIT margins are going to be flat?","Cathy Smith","It is slightly up. So, yes, so slightly down Q3, slightly up in Q4.","Greg Melich","Okay. I just want to make sure I got that right. And then I guess last on that, just to make sure the inventory up 4%, you guys think, I mean are you comfortable with that number, not like part of the third quarter is working that inventory down?","Brian Cornell","Greg, we are very comfortable right now with our inventory position.","Greg Melich","Great. Thanks a lot, good luck.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Dan Binder","Thanks. It\u2019s Dan Binder. I had a question on the consumer electronics category, you talked a lot about that today and I have noticed in your stores recently, you have had some reset activity, particularly in TV as you offer more 4K, I am curious as you work through these plans to improve that business, do think that can be a category that returns to positive comps by holiday given all the changes you are making?","Brian Cornell","Dan, I think it\u2019s going to be largely driven by the new innovation that we bring to the guest in the fourth quarter. So we have certainly seen pockets of strength, I mean there is certainly winners and losers within that space. We have seen continued performance with wearable technology, but it\u2019s not overcoming the softness we have seen in mobile, in tablets and in some of the core items. So I think the success of that category, as always is going to be driven by new news and news that connects with the guests and drives traffic into those categories. So again, it\u2019s why Mark and his team are very focused right now in working with our electronic vendors to make sure we have the right innovation, we are presenting it in a way that\u2019s impactful for the guests. And we have to see improvements in a category that\u2019s been a big drag on our comps over the last couple of quarters.","Dan Binder","And then I have a follow-up on the food category, you mentioned you are reevaluating promotion and I guess food and consumables, I am just curious it sounds like you will increase it, so I am just curious are you seeing others out there being more aggressive in the category, is that what you would attribute the softness to and if that is the case, which channels are you seeing at that?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Dan, I think there has been a lot written recently about the competitive nature of the food channel. And for us on one hand, we feel \u2013 I feel really good about the progress we have made with assortment. If you walk our stores today versus even six months ago, aisle by aisle, you are seeing more organic, more natural, more gluten free, more local items that are on trend. The freshness and the work that John and his team have done from a supply chain standpoint is clearly connecting with the products we are delivering to the guests and we have seen an up-tick in categories like produce because we are delivering better product. But at the same time, market by market, this is a very competitive space. There is clearly food deflation right now that we are facing and it\u2019s a very competitive environment. And back to the earlier question about traffic and performance trends by market, we are looking very specifically at food by market across the country because we face a number of regional competitors and we have got to make sure our presentation, our promotion, our approach enables us to compete market by market.","Dan Binder","Congratulations on the LA25. It sounds like you are getting good results out of that, I was wondering if you could share with us the likelihood of being able to roll that out, is it a cost efficient format or are you primarily using it just for learnings?","Brian Cornell","Well Dan, we have certainly used it as a learning lab, but our intention is to lift the winners from LA25 and quickly bring them into other stores across the country. And while it\u2019s still is very early, we have effectively one quarter of learning under our belt. I am very pleased with some of the results we are seeing in apparel, in home and certainly in food where as I mentioned during my prepared comments, we are seeing performance in those 25 test stores that are clearly, clearly really encouraging from a food standpoint, particularly in the perishables space. So we will be looking to leverage that learning. That\u2019s part of our strategy that we have articulated for several quarters now that we want to use LA as a test market to lift and shift the winning concepts in more stores across the country. And we will continue to lift and leverage the learning from LA25 to improve the experience and the presentation of product throughout our Target stores.","Dan Binder","Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Scott Mushkin","Yes. Hi, I wanted to continue on the path where Dan was going, but before you guys started, I had to say on our store visits, you can definitely see the improving execution, so kudos to John in getting that done. But getting back to the food discussion, our research has shown some pretty aggressive moves and I think Dan was getting at this, I mean are you guys going to match what\u2019s going on in the market and it looks like we are at the beginning end of the pretty aggressive price war, how do you see it, where do we \u2013 we are now seeing deflation reported by the government of 1.5%, 1.6% and our pricing service was even greater than that, so where do you see this going, what do you guys plan to do to combat it tactically in the short-term. And then I wanted to address the longer term food business after that?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Well, Scott, I will start with we are playing to win and we have invested heavily in that very important category. We have had a long-term commitment to food. We think it\u2019s very important for our guests. And over the last couple of years, while we have done it in a very disciplined fashion, category by category and I appreciate hearing you say that you have seen an improvement in execution, hopefully in presentation. We have added thousands of new items. We have worked with our vendor partners to make sure we are bringing the right innovation, category by category. Our team is absolutely going literally item by item, commodity by commodity to look at how we source and how we flow product to improve freshness and the quality we present to our guests. So we are going to make sure we have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right quality. We have to have the right promotional strategy to compete, but we are playing to win both short-term and long-term. We think it\u2019s very important that we continue to make progress in this space. We are going to make sure we do it in a very focused manner. We really like what we are seeing in LA25. We are not going to roll it out to 1,800 stores tomorrow. We are making sure that we can validate what\u2019s working and how can we drive profitable sales in that space, but we are playing to win in food and we are going to continue to roll up our sleeves and make sure that we are into the details finding ways to unlock the growth potential in that critically important category.","Scott Mushkin","So Brian thanks for that answer. So to kind of dovetail more into a longer term, when you were at Safeway, you guys obviously did a lot of remodels that drove comp LA25, it sounds like traffic positive there, but in the article I think it was in the journal, they talked about the Board is very reluctant to put more capital behind the effort, talk us through this, I mean you got a traffic issue, consumables mean traffic, but if you want to invest, it\u2019s hard to get the traffic, so you are almost kind of caught in Catch-22 here and I just want to get your outlook or your thoughts on what I am saying given the longer term need for traffic and to drive traffic into the store to make earnings rise continuously as we look out into the out years?","Brian Cornell","Yes. And Scott, in all due respect for the journal, let me speak on behalf of our leadership team and the Board. We have no hesitancy at all in investing capital in our business that drives growth and the right returns. And as Cathy has demonstrated throughout the last few calls, even in challenging times, we generate significant cash flows. And we want to make sure that the first thing we do with that cash is invest back in our business, so it\u2019s why we are spending time looking at LA25. It\u2019s why we have been testing a number of different features throughout our stores from apparel to home to food. It\u2019s why we are so excited about investing in flex-formats, where we see a very strong response from the guest. Those are delivering very strong returns, well ahead of our original plan. And food plays an important part in those smaller flex-formats. So despite what you may be hearing, we have absolutely complete support from the Board to make sure we are investing capital behind the initiatives that are going to drive future growth. So again, we are not playing for just the short-term. We are playing for the long-term. Those capital investments have to be done on behalf of the guests and our shareholders, but we are looking right now at a number of different opportunities to continue to invest to drive growth. So there is no hesitancy at all in making those investments. And as you just said, food and perishable and consumable categories will play a very important role in driving traffic to our stores. And in the future, we have got to continue to bundle that with the work John is doing to make sure and we are investing and improving our in-store pickup processes and experience. That\u2019s an investment we are making, an investment we are making for the holiday season. We are continuing to invest in our digital assets. So there is no hesitancy at all from this management team nor the Board in making the right investments in our long-term success.","Scott Mushkin","Alright. Thanks guys and thanks for the answers. I appreciate it.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Scott. Operator, we have got time for one last call.","Operator","Okay. Your last question comes from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead with your question.","Joe Feldman","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, one of the questions I had was you guys have made a lot of changes in the stores and we clearly see them and obviously we talked for the past hour about a lot of them. I am curious about the marketing or communication of that though to just the consumer. I mean, we see it because we are all following the company pretty aggressively and in the stores, but I wonder if there is more could be done on the advertising side to tell people that you have made so many changes in grocery or that the home department looks better in a lot of stores or can you talk a little bit about that and where we are at in terms of when we will see something like that communication wise?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Joe, it\u2019s a great question for us to end on and I will take personal responsibility for this. I talked earlier about the fact that we have got to be rebalancing our messaging. And we have done a really terrific job of elevating our messaging and communication around our signature and particularly our style categories. As we go forward, I have used this term before, we have got to make sure we are rebalancing and we have got to make sure we continue to elevate our messaging, our communication around style and those core household essential categories, which include food that drive traffic to our store and important to our guests. So, making sure we go back to the brand promise. We have got to make sure that Expect More categories like style we continue to elevate and we have got to make sure we deliver the Pay Less component and ensure that we balance the work that we are doing from a style standpoint with the progress we are making on those core household essentials, which include food in that offering. So, it\u2019s a really important question. It\u2019s certainly a big area of focus for us in the balance of the year and into 2017. And I think it\u2019s going to be part of the formula that drives traffic back to our stores and improves comp store growth over the balance of the year and into 2017.","Brian Cornell","So operator, with that, we are going to conclude our call and I thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call today. Thanks for participating.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. At this time, you may now disconnect."],"20334":["Target (NYSE:TGT) Q1 2013 Results Earnings Call May 22, 2013  7:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregg Steinhafel - Chairman, CEO, and President","Kathryn Tesija - EVP, Merchandising","John Mulligan - CFO","","Analysts","Peter Benedict - Robert W.

Bernstein","Bob Drbul - Barclays","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Target Corporation\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregg Steinhafel","Good morning, and welcome to our 2013 first quarter earnings conference call.  On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, executive vice president of merchandising; and John Mulligan, executive vice president and chief financial officer.","This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our first quarter results and strategic priorities for the rest of the year, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights, and upcoming initiatives.  And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our outlook for second quarter and the full year. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question and answer session.","As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  A reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","Our first quarter earnings fell short of our expectations, as we faced a choppy and challenging environment caused by unfavorable weather and this year\u2019s payroll tax increase.  Our U.S. business generated softer than expected sales and traffic, particularly in our seasonal categories, as we experienced one of the coldest spring seasons on record, following record warmth a year ago.","While we are not satisfied with this quarter\u2019s performance, we remain highly confident in our strategy and our team\u2019s ability to deliver strong results going forward across a broad range of conditions.  In the first quarter, our U.S. segment generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, down 5% from last year\u2019s outstanding performance.","Our first quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.77, $0.28 lower than adjusted EPS, driven primarily by $0.24 of dilution attributable to our Canadian segment.  As we mentioned in our fourth quarter call, this year there are several notable changes affecting our financial reporting which John will cover in detail in a few minutes.","In the quarter, comparable store sales declined 0.6% from last year\u2019s 5.3% increase.  First quarter comparable transactions were down 1.9%, following last year\u2019s increase of 2%, keeping us essentially flat on a two-year basis.  In much of the U.S., traffic in our seasonal categories was unexpectedly soft, as guests held off purchasing spring items in the face of cold and wet weather.  Our merchandising teams did a great job of reacting to the pace of sales in these categories, retiming receipts and adjusting them downward, so we are still in a healthy inventory position today.","Despite the weather impact on seasonal categories, sales and traffic in our digital channels continued to grow at a robust pace.  Overall, first quarter digital sales grew in the high teens, and increased more than 20% net of our most seasonally sensitive categories.","Target\u2019s mobile traffic and sales continue to grow at a triple-digit pace, with mobile traffic representing more than 30% of our digital traffic in the first quarter.  We\u2019re pleased with these results, as mobile is rapidly becoming the key platform for digital commerce across all of retail, and we know that Target guests have a particular affinity for mobile engagement.","After two years of preparation, in March we opened our first 24 Canadian stores in the greater Toronto area, and we\u2019re very pleased with the reception we received from our new Canadian guests.  We experienced an unexpectedly strong surge in sales as guests were eager to see their newly opened Target store.  The mix of sales in home and apparel was even higher than expected, as guests shopped our assortment of stylish owned brands and national brands, responding to the outstanding value we provide on both.","Now that we are beyond the grand opening surge in this first cycle of stores, we\u2019re encouraging our new Canadian guests to make Target a preferred destination for categories throughout the store, including food, health, beauty, and household essentials, as these categories play a key role in driving trip frequency over time.  ","As it is already in the U.S., Red Card Rewards will be a key differentiator for Target in Canada, and we\u2019re encouraged that Red Card penetration of sales in our Canadian segment was ahead of plan in the first quarter.  Two weeks ago, we opened our second wave of 24 Canadian stores in British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba, and we\u2019re very pleased with the initial guest response in these markets and the ability of our teams and systems to accommodate the increasing volume of traffic and sales.","We plan to open another 20 stores in Canada later in the quarter, on the way to operating 124 Canadian stores by the end of this year.  This means we expect to open more Target stores in our first year in Canada than we opened in our first 10 years in the United States, an incredible accomplishment that has required unprecedented effort by teams throughout the company.","In the U.S., we opened six new stores in the first quarter, including an additional City Target location in Los Angeles.  We now operate six City Target locations in four cities, and we continue to be pleased with the results in these stores.  Sales have essentially met our expectations and the mix of home and apparel has been better than expected.","Similar to our Canadian stores, we are focused on our City Target stores, on driving sales and visits in our frequency and commodity categories, changing guest habits, and inspiring them to visit us more often for both want and need.","In the first quarter, we also closed the sale of our U.S. credit card receivables portfolio to TD Bank Group and began deploying proceeds to reduce debt and repurchase shares.  We\u2019re very pleased to have reached the right agreement with the right partner, in a transaction that removed these more volatile assets from our balance sheet.  The portfolio continues to perform well, generating meaningful income for Target through our profit sharing arrangement with TD.  ","As we look ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic about both the macroeconomic environment and consumer behavior.  Both of these business drivers continue to reflect slow, uneven growth and ongoing cross currents of positive and negative indicators, just as they have for the past few years.","For example, while we\u2019re pleased that the housing market has stabilized and jobless claims have been declining, we\u2019re mindful that household formation and job growth remain particularly weak among younger demographic groups.  In addition, guests continue to face the headwinds of this year\u2019s payroll tax increase and a meaningful lack of income growth.","With these considerations in mind, we remain focused on strategies that position our business for profitable growth, both today and in the long term.  We continue to invest in initiatives that integrate multiple channels like our recent beta launch of Cartwheel, the result of our collaboration with Facebook, along with tests of same-day delivery with Google and eBay.","And we\u2019re testing opportunities within our own supply chain that will leverage our existing store and distribution assets to provide additional services and capabilities our guests value most.  We\u2019re investing to drive adoption of our 5% Red Card Rewards and Pharmacy Rewards loyalty programs, which have proven to be unique and powerful differentiators and sales drivers for Target.  Both of these programs offer guests the opportunity for even greater savings, leading them to shop more merchandise categories more often.","We\u2019re investing in efforts to better serve all of our guests, driving traffic and sales by segmenting our stores and assortments to match local tastes and preferences, and we continue to offer digital innovations that create a link between our stores and social media.  We\u2019re continuing to pursue new and differentiated merchandise in all of our assortments, including our recently announced partnership with Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment to feature Justice League merchandise across multiple categories.  Kathy will provide more detail on programs like these that create a sense of discovery for our guests while deepening their loyalty for Target.","Beyond the value we provide on exclusive, well-designed merchandise, we continue to invest in everyday low prices, which we reduce even further in our weekly ad.  In addition, we stand behind our prices with policy to match local competitor print ads as well as our largest online competitors.  And, through Red Card Rewards and Pharmacy Rewards, our most loyal guests have the opportunity to save even more.","Throughout the company, we take a disciplined approach to the deployment of cash, combining strong financial rigor and capital investment decisions with a focus on returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  ","And, of course, none of our efforts would be possible without the outstanding work of our more than 360,000 team members who greet and serve our guests every day, carefully manage inventory and expenses in a challenging environment, and proudly represent our brand in the communities where they live.","In spite of first quarter tax increases, unseasonably cold weather, and challenging prior year comparisons, our underlying business continues to be stable and healthy.  Our team is focused on driving outstanding results across categories, channels, regions, and guest segments every day, even while we continue to position our business for success with investments in new stores and formats and more flexible ways of serving our guests.  We believe that our outstanding team, aligned in support of a well-defined strategy, will drive strong performance, both this year and over time.  ","Before I turn the call over to Kathy, I want to take a moment to thank Terry Scully, who retired from his role as president of Target\u2019s financial and retail services team in April.  Terry has been a valuable member of the Target team for nearly 35 years, and under his leadership the financial and retail services team has played a key role in strengthening guest loyalty and delivering substantial profitable growth for Target.  Over the last few years, Terry and his team have worked tirelessly to find the right partner to purchase our credit card receivables portfolio, culminating in this quarter\u2019s sale.  ","And finally, I want to pause to express our condolences to the residents of Moore, Oklahoma, including Target team members, guests, and their families, who were affected by this week\u2019s devastating tornado.  We have been working with emergency responders, community organizations, and local schools to evaluate immediate needs and ways that Target can help.  ","And, yesterday we announced that Target is donating $250,000 in support of relief efforts, $200,000 of cash and in kind donations to emergency responders and community organizations including the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, and $50,000 to support rebuilding efforts at the two elementary schools that were badly damaged by the tornado.  ","Now Kathy will provide more detail on first quarter results and outline initiatives for the second quarter and beyond.  Kathy?  ","Kathryn Tesija","Thanks, Greg.  Those of you who have listened to our conference calls over time know that often, when we\u2019re asked about weather impacts, we point out that on average the weather is average.  This has certainly proven true in the last two spring seasons.  Last year, it was an unusually early and warm spring across much of the country.  We saw very strong sales in our seasonal weather-sensitive categories.","This year, in the face of a cold and late spring, sales were quite soft in those same categories.  And, while we are committed to delivering strong results in all types of environments, we believe it\u2019s important to understand the impact of this year\u2019s weather on our first quarter sales results.","Specifically, first quarter comparable store sales in weather-dependent categories like seasonal apparel, lawn, patio, and sporting goods lagged the rest of our assortments by 6-7 percentage points.  This sales gap was even wider in areas of the country which experienced below-average temperatures and which was much smaller in areas that experienced more normal spring temperatures, like the western U.S. ","Looking more broadly at our category results, first quarter comparable store sales continued to be strongest in less discretionary categories such as food, health, beauty, and household essentials, all of which experienced low single digit increases.  Our home and apparel category were both down in the low single digits and hardlines saw a mid single digit decline in comps.","Within hardlines, electronics continues to see softness in videogames, along with televisions, particularly early in the quarter as last year\u2019s 53rd accounting week moved Super Bowl related sales out of the quarter. ","As Greg mentioned, our guest continue to shop cautiously, planning their spending and sticking to shopping lists, and they continue to feel the burden of economic pressures.  Recent guest surveys indicate that three-quarters of our guest are aware of this year\u2019s payroll tax increase, and among those, the majority have noticed the impact of the tax increase on their paychecks and indicate that it\u2019s affected their spending.  ","Basket data confirms that needs-based trips have been increasing, while wants-based trips focused on discretionary categories have been declining.  And notably, recent data from the Conference Board indicates that while sentiment among consumers regarding their current situation has been improving since late last year, consumer sentiment regarding the future has been declining in recent months.","To drive traffic and sales in this environment, we know it\u2019s more important than ever to provide value to our guests on a high quality, differentiated assortment delivered through a convenient shopping experience.  In the digital space, we continue to apply a test and learn approach when rolling out applications and capabilities so we can determine what works best for our guests.","We\u2019re pleased that our digital traffic grew faster than industry benchmarks again this quarter.  We continue to explore ways to integrate digital technologies with social media and our stores to provide a unique shopping experience for our guests.  ","This quarter\u2019s beta launch of Cartwheel, which we developed in collaboration with Facebook, is a perfect example.  This first of a kind experience gives guests a fun way to save on hundreds of items throughout our stores.  ","Upon authenticating this application through their Facebook profile, guests receive ten spots to fill with deals of their choice from among hundreds of items throughout our store.  Depending on the product, the deals feature a range of discounts and expiration dates, and guests can switch between offers at any time.  Deals are redeemed at checkout in our stores, either by scanning a single barcode on a mobile device or a printout from our desktop computer.  ","Guests can share Cartwheel with their friends on Facebook to show off their latest finds and see what their friends are buying.  And the more guests interact with Cartwheel by choosing and redeeming deals and sharing those deals with friends, the more offers they unlock for themselves.","We launched Cartwheel in beta, and we\u2019re encouraging guests to provide feedback so we can make ongoing real-time enhancements to the Cartwheel experience.  Initial signups for Cartwheel have exceeded expectations.  Thousands of guests signed up in the first week, and we saw a meaningful increase when we added a link to Cartwheel on Target.com. More than 10% of guests who have signed up already have redeemed Cartwheel offers in one of our stores.  ","Also this quarter, we launched a beauty box test to understand our guests\u2019 appetite to pay for samples of beauty products.  We tested this offer on Target\u2019s Facebook Style page and sold through our inventory within a week.  In addition, the offer generated favorable media coverage and positive feedback in social media.  Based on these results, we will continue to explore ways to surprise and delight guests with box-based offers that support our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise.  ","In March, we were very pleased to announce our agreement to acquire Chefs Catalog and assets of Cooking.com in two separate transactions.  These ecommerce acquisitions are aimed at expanding Target\u2019s presence in the growing cooking and kitchenware market.  We\u2019ve combined the assets of Cooking.com with Chefs Catalog to create a new wholly owned subsidiary which will continue to operate the two brands under their current names.","We believe these transactions present a strategic growth opportunity to serve guests who are increasingly looking online for cooking solutions to make their lives easier, from utensils and cookware to recipes.  These strategic transactions provide us a great way to address this growing opportunity and provide expanded online options for our guests.","In select markets, we\u2019re continuing to test same-day delivery in partnership with Google and eBay.  Our focus in these tests is to understand the level of guest engagement and this fulfillment opportunity.  These projects, which are still in the test phase, continue to provide valuable information on the store back room capabilities and processes needed to support this offering.  ","And, as we mentioned last quarter, this year we\u2019re launching our own test of flexible fulfillment in the Minneapolis market.  This month, we launched a test in which team members are given the opportunity to order online and pick up in store.  We will use our team members\u2019 feedback to improve the process and experience before the pilot becomes guest-facing later in the year. Two other team member pilots, pay in store to pick up at another store, and pay online and ship from store, are planned for late in the year.  ","In both our stores and online, we feature great designers and brands and continue to roll out new, unique merchandise that creates a sense of discovery for our guests.  Our goal is to show guests that design means more than fashion, and that great design doesn\u2019t have to mean high prices.  ","In home, we continue to be pleased with results from our partnership with Nate Burkus.  The collection includes a growing list of products in a wide range of categories, including bedding, bath, accessories, lighting, rugs, and stationery.  ","We also continue to see great results from the rollout of the Threshold brand, which is replacing Target Home, our largest owned brand.  We debuted Threshold last fall, and guests continue to respond to this fully redesigned, high quality collection that\u2019s inspiring them to update their homes.","To celebrate this new brand, earlier this month Target constructed a life-sized dollhouse in New York\u2019s iconic Grand Central Terminal, where guests could explore a two-story, seven-room dollhouse, decorated with more than 3,500 pieces from the Threshold collection.  Select furnishings were tagged with QR codes to be shoppable, right from the dollhouse.","In our stationery category, we\u2019re excited about our collaboration with Todd Oldham on the Kid Made Modern collection, which offers creative activity kits and supplies to inspire kids through art. The collection has a clean, simple, and fresh design that\u2019s gender-neutral and age-appropriate to inspire all children and parents.  We launched this collection of creative design tools late last year, and set a new collection this spring.","Following our successful first quarter partnership with Prabal Gurung and Kate Young, we recently announced our latest design collaboration with Lauren Bush Lauren and the rollout of the Feed USA + Target collection.  In late June, we\u2019ll feature the lifestyle collection of stylish products in home, sporting goods, stationery, apparel, and accessories.  ","The collection, which reflects a modern Americana aesthetic while supporting an important cause, includes more than 50 products across a range of price points, with most items less than $25.  Each item in the collection has an associated number of meals listed with it, and with each sale, Target will donate the monetary equivalent of that number of meals to Feeding America, the nation\u2019s leading domestic hunger relief charity and a partner of Target since 2001. During the time that the products will be available, we expect to provide more than 10 million meals for families across the U.S. ","In Canada, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the results from our partnership with Roots Outfitters, an iconic Canadian brand that offers quality craftsmanship and comfortable styling on a line of apparel for men, women, and kids.  And, we\u2019re very excited that we recently announced a fall partnership with Beaver Canoe, a member of the Roots Canada family, to offer an exclusive collection of cabin chic apparel and home items in our Canadian stores this fall.","Entertainment had a great first quarter, including the release of our exclusive deluxe version of \u201cThe 20\/20 Experience\u201d from Justin Timberlake.  The strength of the guest response put this release among the top three at target in the last 10 years.  We followed this success with releases of exclusive albums from The Band Perry and Michael Buble in April.","In Electronics, we\u2019ve partnered with Wired magazine to offer a custom curated assortment of consumer electronics and gadgets tested by their editors, featuring their expert tips on usage and key features.  And, in April, Target became the exclusive mass retailer to debut the Beats by Dr. Dre Neon Mixer headphones, available in eye-catching green, orange, pink, yellow, and blue.","We\u2019ve long known the value we can create through segmentation of our stores and assortments based on store location and demographics.  We continue to develop tools and processes that allow us to further localize assortments and experiences to match the specific markets where our stores are located.  We are focused on providing a deeper presence of locally relevant products and brands across the store, including categories like food, beauty, home, and entertainment.  And, we continue to invest in unique, multichannel experiences like Cartwheel that allow guests to choose their own offers and further integrate their target experience into their social networks.","Now John will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter and full year.  John?  ","John Mulligan","Thanks, Kathy.  As Greg mentioned, we\u2019re disappointed with our first quarter financial performance.  Sales in the U.S. were softer than expected, even relative to updated guidance we provided in April, causing our reported earnings per share to fall short of our updated guidance as well.","Adjusted earnings per share, which measures the results of our U.S. operations, were $1.05, representing a 5% decrease from last year.  First quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.77, reflecting losses on early retirement of debt, which reduced our EPS by $0.41, EPS dilution related to our Canadian segment of $0.24, and net accounting gains of $0.36 related to the sale of our credit card portfolio.","Before I turn to our segment results, I want to remind you of a couple of factors that will be affecting our financial reporting this year.  First, with the sale of our receivables, beginning with the first quarter we are no longer reporting a credit card segment, and we now have two reportable segments, a new U.S. segment and a Canadian segment.  In the first quarter, we began recognizing profit sharing payments from TD net of operating expenses within SG&A expense in the U.S. segment.","To provide context, in an April 16 8-K, we provided revised quarterly segment reporting for fiscal years 2010 through 2012, in which credit card revenues net of expenses from our former U.S. credit card segment were recognized within SG&A expenses in the new U.S. segment.  In this year\u2019s financial reporting, revised 2012 U.S. segment results will be presented as prior year results.","To provide additional context, this year\u2019s rate analysis includes a comparison to last year\u2019s performance in the historical U.S. retail segment.  For simplicity, to the extent that\u2019s possible, in my discussions today I will focus only on this year\u2019s U.S. segment results, compared with last year\u2019s revised U.S. segment results.  ","Second, as I mentioned in our last conference call, we\u2019ve made changes to our vendor agreements regarding payments received in support of our marketing programs.  As a result, in fiscal 2013 these payments will be recognized as a reduction in our cost of sales rather than a reduction to SG&A expense.  This change is expected to create equivalent year over year increases in our U.S. segment gross margin and SG&A expense rates of 20 to 25 basis points, without affecting EBITDA and EBIT margin rates.","With that as context, I\u2019ll turn to the first quarter performance in our new U.S. segment.  Total sales increased 0.5%, on a 0.6% decline in comparable store sales, combined with the contribution from new stores.  Among the drivers of comparable store sales, traffic was down 1.9%, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in average ticket.","Our first quarter traffic decline essentially offset a 2% increase a year ago.  As we told you at the time, we believed first quarter 2012 was unusually strong due to the warm weather, and that proved to be the case as full year 2012 traffic was up 0.5%.  While we expect traffic will continue to be challenging given our near term outlook for the economy and the consumer, we don\u2019t expect to continue to see traffic declines of the magnitude we saw in the first quarter.  ","With the added pressure on household budges from the recent payroll tax increase, the simplicity and compelling nature of our 5% Red Card Rewards discount is clearly attracting an increasing number of guests.  The penetration of sales on Red Cards reached 17.1% in the first quarter, up from less than 12% a year ago.","While discounts from this program continue to put pressure on our gross margin rate, this investment paid back through the benefit of increased loyalty and sales.  We continue to see households increase their spending more than 50% on average when they begin using a Red Card.  And, in Kansas City, which is a year ahead of the rest of the country, penetration is above 20%, and the rate of increase has shown no sign of slowing down.","Our U.S. segment gross margin rate was 30.7% in the first quarter, up about 50 basis points from a year ago.  The change in recognition of vendor payments explained about 20 basis points of this increase.  The remainder of the improvement was driven by rate increases within categories, which more than offset continuing gross margin rate pressure from our sales driving Red Card rewards and remodel programs.","Every year, Kathy\u2019s team works hard to incrementally improve gross margin rates within categories, and the year over year benefit from these efforts can vary meaningfully from quarter to quarter.  In the first quarter, the magnitude of category rate improvement was stronger than normal, and we\u2019re expecting to see a more modest benefit in upcoming quarters.","Our first quarter U.S. segment SG&A rate of 20.3% was about 130 basis points higher than last year\u2019s revised U.S. segment rate.  The primary drivers of this variance are about 50 basis points resulting from lower earnings on the credit card portfolio and about 40 basis points related to technology, including our multichannel efforts.  In addition, the change in vendor payments drove the rate higher by about 20 basis points, and of course with lower than expected sales, we saw less overall expense leverage than we anticipated.  ","On this last point, it\u2019s important to note that our first quarter results reflected meaningful store productivity improvements, and the entire organization did a great job controlling expenses.  As I mentioned in the last call, we\u2019re anticipating incremental expense pressure from technology investments throughout 2013, and we plan to offset that pressure through disciplined expense management across the enterprise as the year progresses.","Also, I think it\u2019s important to provide more context for the decline in our earnings from the credit card portfolio, because the portfolio continues to experience outstanding performance.  However, there are three separate reasons which drove lower earnings from the credit card portfolio in the first quarter.  First, the asset is smaller than a year ago.  Second, we\u2019re annualizing a $35 million reserve release in the first quarter of 2012.  And finally, we began sharing portfolio profits with TD after the sale closed in March.","Notably, among these three reasons, profit sharing drove less than half of the year over year reduction in Target\u2019s earnings from the credit card portfolio, and we expect all of these pressures will continue for the next several quarters.","Moving down the U.S. segment P&L, we reported a first quarter EBITDA rate of 10.4%, about 80 basis points lower than last year\u2019s revised U.S. segment rate.  With about 50 basis points related to our credit card portfolio, that means our U.S. retail operations accounted for only a 30-basis point decline in the EBIT rate compared with last year, which is relatively stable when one considers that sales were unexpectedly soft this year and we were annualizing a 5.3% comp last year.","In our Canadian segment, we generated $86 million in sales from 24 stores that were open, on average, a little more than half the quarter.  Whenever we open a new store in the U.S., there is a rush of traffic and sales as curious guests shop it for the first time, but the rush in Canada exceeded our expectations.  ","The first quarter gross margin rate in Canada was more than 38%, which is much stronger than our long term expectations for a couple of reasons.  First, in new stores we experienced a strong initial mix of home and apparel sales, as guests end to shop these categories on their first trip to these stores.  In addition, given the short time these stores have been open, they have not yet experienced any meaningful transitions or clearance activity, so this quarter\u2019s Canadian gross margin rate didn\u2019t reflect the impact of markdowns we\u2019d expect to see over time.","First quarter Canadian segment P&L was dominated by startup expenses related to the 100 additional stores we\u2019re preparing to open later in the quarter.  For the quarter, Canadian segment operations drove $0.24 of dilution to our consolidated earnings per share.  ","With the sale of our credit card portfolio in March, we recognized a pretax accounting gain of $391, of which $166 million was cash received in excess of book value and $225 million was related to a beneficial interest asset.  This asset effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit sharing payments we expect to receive from TD on the credit card balances transferred at the time of the sale.","Going forward, a portion of the profit sharing payments from TD will be applied to unwind the beneficial interest assets.  We expect to fully unwind it in three to four years, and expect to reduce its size by about 50% in the first 12 months following the sale.","Also following the portfolio sale, we began deploying proceeds to retire debt and repurchase shares.  Concurrent with the sale, we repaid, at par, $1.5 billion in funding that was previously backed by the receivables.  We also launched debt tender offers to repurchase another $1 billion in high coupon debt, which led to losses, recorded in interest expense, of $445 million in the quarter.  Of course, these tender offers created a meaningful economic benefit not reflected in the accounting for these losses.  ","During the quarter, we also paid off commercial paper that we had used to provide short term funding following the $2 billion in debt maturities last January.  Finally, there is another $500 million maturity in June, which we expect to fund with proceeds from the sale.","We\u2019re pleased that with the completion of the sale we were able to remove these more volatile assets from our balance sheet and quickly reduce a meaningful amount of debt that was funding them.  Over time, we expect to apply the remainder of the proceeds from the portfolio sale to repurchase shares.  In the first quarter, we invested $547 million to repurchase 8.5 million Target shares at an average price of just over $64.","For the full year, we continue to expect to invest more than $2 million to retire shares, and we\u2019ll continue to govern the pace of execution in support of our goal to maintain our strong investment grade credit ratings.","We paid first quarter dividends of $232 million, marking the 182nd consecutive quarterly dividend we\u2019ve paid since becoming a public company.  We will recommend that the board approve an increase in the dividend later this year, which would make 2013 our 42nd straight year in which we increased the annual dividend.","Now let\u2019s turn to our expectations for the second quarter and the year.  In the U.S., we remain cautious about the near term sales environment, given the economic and consumer challenges Kathy and Greg mentioned earlier.  Yet with the recent weather challenge behind us, and easier comparison from last year, we expect second quarter comparable store sales will recover into the 2% to 3% range.","So far in May, we\u2019ve continued to see cautious buying behavior from our guests, but the pace of sale has supported our view of the quarter.  In the U.S. segment, we expect the second quarter gross margin rate will be up slightly from last year, driven entirely by the change in recognition of vendor payments.  ","We expect our second quarter SG&A expense rate will be just over 21%, nearly a full percentage point higher than last year\u2019s revised U.S. segment rate, driven primarily by a smaller benefit from credit card income and the change in recognition of vendor payments.  This would put our second quarter EBITDA margin rate at about 10.5%, and with expected leverage on [D&A], an EBIT margin rate of 7.5%.","In Canada, second quarter sales will ramp up meaningfully from the first quarter pace, yet startup expenses will continue to dominate the P&L.  As a result, for the quarter we anticipate expenses from our Canadian operations, including interest expense measured outside the segment, will create $0.16 of dilution to our earnings per share.","We continue to expect Canadian dilution will come down further in the third quarter, and by the fourth quarter, we expect our Canadian operations will be slightly accretive to our consolidated earnings.","Altogether, we expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.09 to $1.19.  We expect our GAAP EPS will be $0.19 lower than adjusted EPS, in the range of $0.90 to $1.00, reflecting $0.16 of dilution due to Canada and $0.03 of dilution related to the unwind of the beneficial interest asset related to the receivables sale.","For the year, we have an even more tempered view of sales than we did three months ago.  Without some unexpected improvement in the economy and the consumer, our full year comparable store sales will likely grow in the 2% to 2.5% range, somewhat below the 2.7% we outlined at the beginning of the year.  ","This updated view of sales has also tempered our view of full year earnings per share, causing us to take our expected range for adjusted EPS down $0.15 to the $4.70 to $4.90 range.  We expect full year GAAP EPS to be $0.58 lower than adjusted EPS, in the $4.12 to $4.32 range, reflecting Canadian segment dilution, [unintelligible] on early debt retirement, and net gains from the credit card portfolio sale.","Longer term, we continue to feel very good about the health of our business and the steps we are taking to keep our business relevant over time.  We continue to invest in our remodel program, loyalty initiatives, technology, the integration of our store and digital experience, the new City Target format, and our Canadian segment.  ","Yet even with those initiatives, we continue to expect to generate far more cash than we need to invest in our business, giving us the opportunity to return billions of dollars to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As a result, we continue to expect Target will continue to deliver earnings per share of $8 or more by 2017, combined with a dividend of $3 or more that same year.  ","That concludes today\u2019s prepared remarks, and now Greg, Kathy, and I will be happy to respond to your questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Your first question comes from the line of Peter Benedict of Robert Baird.  ","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","Just on the U.S. gross margin performance, can you give us a sense of maybe what that Red Card impact was in the quarter?","John Mulligan ","You know, the combination of that with the store remodel program, very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past several quarters.  Somewhere between 25 to 30 basis points of impact.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","You kind of said for the year you\u2019re now thinking 2-2.5.  I assume that still has a pretty modest view for comping in the fourth quarter.  Is that correct?  And then secondly, when you think out beyond, do you guys think maybe 2-3 is the longer term comp profile for the business?  Or do you think it could still be north of 3, just when you think of a more normalized environment on an annual basis?","John Mulligan ","I think your view of Q4 is right.  I think in particular this Q4 will be particularly difficult, given the 53rd week and the calendar shifts this year.  You\u2019ll recall we\u2019re going to lose six business days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which will make the comp feel much more difficult than it otherwise might.  I think over the longer term, we continue to think a 3 comp is about the right place to be.  ","If you look, again, at our company over 15 years or 20 years, if you net out the contribution of new store annualization, we essentially ran pretty consistently a 3 comp over time, through good times and tougher times.  So we think, in an economic environment that might just be a little bit better than today, it doesn\u2019t have to improve drastically, but a little better than today, we think a 3 comp makes sense.  ","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","And on the Canadian D&A, what do you think the run rate is for that once you get out?  You\u2019ve opened a bunch of the stores.  Once you get those to the end of the year, what kind of run rates were you thinking about for Canadian D&A?  ","John Mulligan ","I think you\u2019ll continue to see D&A grow throughout this year as we continue to put significant assets into service.  And we\u2019ll provide a little bit more color, as we get later into the year and have a little bit more clarity about sales margin and the entire P&L.  We\u2019ll provide a little bit more clarity about the entire P&L for Canada.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton of Piper Jaffray.","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray  ","In terms of just dissecting the comp in Q1, transaction trends, as you mentioned, were relatively stable on a two-year basis, and didn\u2019t improve from Q4.  But the units per transaction were down 50 basis points, and I think that\u2019s the first time since \u201909.  Just wondering what would explain that decline given the increase in the remodel program from Q1 last year.","John Mulligan ","Actually, I\u2019m not quite clear on your question.  Units per transaction in the first quarter were up year over year.  Help me with that again?","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ","Oh, I thought that were down 50 basis points, maybe I\u2019m missing something.","John Mulligan ","No, selling price per unit was down 60 basis points.  Entirely mix.  But units were up consistently for some of the reasons you described.","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ","And then Gregg, you touched briefly on the price matching.  Just curious if you are seeing the number of request for the price match change at all.  And has there been any competitive response to that in the marketplace?","Gregg Steinhafel ","You know, both the stores with the matching of competitors\u2019 physical ads and the online match has been fairly stable, and has not grown materially over the last quarter.  So it still represents a very small portion of our transactions, and that\u2019s because our everyday price and our promotional prices are so strong.  There\u2019s generally not much of a gap, if any.  So we continue to watch our competitive prices on a day-in and day-out basis, and move where we have to be competitive in the marketplace and so we expect over time this not to change that much.","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray ","And then just lastly, on digital, you\u2019re obviously seeing some nice traction, nice growth outside of the seasonal categories.  Can you talk about just the impact on margin for that sale today?  Is it dilutive?  Or is it accretive to the margin?  And how are you planning that over time?","Gregg Steinhafel ","First, I start with how we think about this longer term, and we think about, from a longer-term perspective, sales through all of our channels, regardless of the channel, need to generate a return, and a return on investment that\u2019s similar to what we see in our current U.S. store base.  ","What we see today is, honestly we\u2019re learning a lot about that channel, and a lot of this depends on how we\u2019re going to ultimately [settle on] a share count that our guest wants to interact with us, how much is shipped from store, how much is shipped to store.  That will have a significant impact ultimately on the EBITDA margin rates of that particular channel.  ","But I think once again, depending on where those EBITDA margin rates land, sales or capital will move around, and we feel very confident that we\u2019ll get back to a return that makes sense.  Having said all that, I think as it relates to the rates embedded within that channel we feel very comfortable that ultimately that can operate at that 10% EBITDA rate that we\u2019ve said is part of our long-range plan.  ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.  ","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","First, I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on sales in geographic areas that had more neutral weather, like Florida.  Were the transactions and the comps positive in those markets?","Kathryn Tesija ","You know, we did see better results in areas that had more normal weather.  So that would primarily be the west coast.  And they were toughest in those seasonal categories where we saw weather off the most, and that would be primarily in the Midwest.  So we did see quite a swing between the different geographies.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then in terms of the second quarter guidance, do we assume that there\u2019s some incremental markdown risk in seasonal categories?  You did mention that within categories the rate improvement would be a little softer in the second quarter than in the first quarter.  So just wondering what the markdown risk is in seasonal categories.","Gregg Steinhafel ","Yeah, like we\u2019ve said, the teams did a very good job of responding to the sales shortfall and retiming receipts and making cancellations.  We\u2019re going to know a heck of a lot more in the next 30 days as we see what happens, and how the sales of these categories play out, before we have to take markdowns on the Fourth of July.  If we get really good weather, and we have good sell-throughs, then we\u2019re going to be right back on plan.  If things stay damp and cool for an extended period of time, there might be some risk.  But we don\u2019t expect to see a significant risk whatsoever.  So we\u2019re talking about things on the edges right now.","John Mulligan ","The other thing I\u2019d add, a little bit hard to see with the inventory on the balance sheet, the inventory per store in the U.S. is essentially flat to last year.  All of the inventory build year over year is attributable to Canada.  So we feel really good about where the inventory positions are in aggregate.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then just lastly, if we look at your operating expenses in the U.S. retail segment, dollar growth accelerated a little bit versus the last few quarters.  I\u2019m assuming a lot of that is technology investments.  But given the more moderated view of comps for the full year, could we see the dollar growth potentially come back down a little bit?","John Mulligan ","Yeah, I think you\u2019re right, first of all, that the vast majority of that is multichannel technology, and we\u2019ve said, you know, a little bit of missed timing here.  We expect to offset that on the year with expense savings and improvements we\u2019re making in our business, but the investment coming in a little ahead of that.  ","To your second point, I think that\u2019s absolutely right, and it\u2019s interesting, we said this last year, when our sales accelerate or decelerate rapidly from our expectations, we tend to see our SG&A lag both directions.  It doesn\u2019t climb as fast when sales go up, like last year, and doesn\u2019t come down quite as quickly when we see sales decelerate.  And as we adapt to wherever sales are going to be, you\u2019ll see our SG&A settle in at a more appropriate level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan of Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","First question on Canada.  Understand that the gross margin rate of 38% is not the long run rate.  But where do you think that settles out, and was the 38% above where you expected even kind of adjusting for the mix that you saw?","Gregg Steinhafel ","Yeah, I would say out of the box the 38% was a little higher than we expected, because the mix was a little bit better than we expected out of the box.  Now, whether it\u2019s in Canada or the U.S., clearly when we open a new store, we hit a higher gross margin rate.  But the mix was even higher than the higher that we expected.  So we do expect that to settle down and be slightly higher than what it is in the U.S. because we expect the mix to be a little bit better than it is here in the U.S.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Of course, and as the consumables business ramps up, mix is down, but from a productivity perspective, can you tell anything yet on these first stores that  are open in terms of opening expectations relative to what you would have thought?  Or was it just too much hoopla that you can\u2019t discern anything yet?","Gregg Steinhafel ","Well, I wouldn\u2019t call it hoopla.  I would just say that the guests were very, very excited and we experienced tremendous surges in sales.  And it\u2019s just very, very early to draw any conclusions and we really wanted to deliver a great experience.  ","And so to a certain extent, we went in with staffing levels to make sure that we were taking care of the guests at the front end, and we had the right team members there for the supply chain, and we had the right teams on the sales floor.  So we know that over time, and in our run safe condition, we have to work hard at making sure that we get our productivity levels where the business model dictates them to be, and we know our gross margins will settle in, and we\u2019ve got to become more productive and run the business.  ","Over time, our consumables share will grow, because that\u2019s the hardest trip to change with the guest, and so we\u2019re going to continue to focus on those frequency oriented categories so that we can not only get the good mix that we\u2019re getting, but we want to now start driving more trip frequency into the store.  ","And we didn\u2019t want to come out of the box by hitting those categories too hard, because we wanted to make sure that we led with our strengths, and we wanted to make sure that all the supply chains and the operational disciplines were in place.  We feel very confident now that they are, so we\u2019re ready to start making those kinds of adjustments in merchandising and supply chain and store operations to start refining the model.   ","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Second, on the credit, I actually thought the contribution of $105 million, while you explained why it was lower, it seemed to me it was higher than I would have expected, especially given the bad debt reserve release last year.  Is there anything there that reflects the $105 million profit share?","","John Mulligan ","I think the one thing I would remind you is we only had a half a quarter\u2019s worth of profit sharing with TD.  Next quarter we\u2019ll have a full quarter\u2019s worth of profit sharing with TD.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","So the $105 million was really a $210 million quarterly run rate?","John Mulligan ","No, because that\u2019s net of our operating expenses as well.","","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","","And then finally, just coming back to SG&A, the dollars were up I think $233 million.  If I x out the credit difference of $35 million, the vendor allowance of $13 million, the technology spend, it still looks like the growth is pretty healthy.  John, I know you mentioned that there\u2019s a lag, just in terms of how quickly you can get after that if sales are disappointing.  Would you also expect some of the expense things you\u2019re doing on a longer term basis to impact that?  And I guess my question is, can we see better performance out of that line?  Because it sounds like the Q2 guidance doesn\u2019t get us there.  ","John Mulligan ","No question.  And what we\u2019re seeing, I think we talked about this a little bit five weeks ago when we were together, you\u2019ll see the ramp up in our expense initiatives throughout the year and through next year, actually.  Many of them are a little bit longer lead times to pull out expense.  You know, all the easy stuff we\u2019ve done a long, long time ago.  So we do expect, through time, SG&A will come down and manage to a level that is more appropriate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Bob Drbul - Barclays ","I guess the question that I have for you is twofold, but it revolves around traffic.  When you look at the initiatives that you have in place, Red Card and Pfresh, and I understand the seasonal piece, Q1 this year versus last year, but when you think conceptually traffic was down in the fourth quarter and that was down again in the first quarter, how do you sort of get us comfortable with essentially the efficiency and the effectiveness of these initiatives over the longer term period?  And the second question that I have is the lower comp assumption for this year, can you maybe just break down the traffic component in that new 2-2.5% expectation?","Gregg Steinhafel ","The traffic, you know, it was a disappointing quarter for us.  We had very, very strong traffic last year.  There was pluses and minuses throughout 2012, and we expect traffic trends to get stronger as the year goes on.  And we have all of our initiatives designed to not only deepen the relationship but build frequency.  So we\u2019ll perhaps be a little bit more aggressive on price, to look at the competitive environment.  It was a little bit more aggressive than it had been in the past, where there was more emphasis on price and that can, I think, impact it a little bit.  But overall, we really expect to be able to generate traffic levels that are flattish, give or take, over normalized periods of time.","John Mulligan ","And Bob, the other thing I would add, I don\u2019t think we need to run traffic numbers like we did last year in first quarter to generate that 3 comp.  I think if you look over the past several years, about a half a point of traffic, combined with ticket, gets us to a 3 comp.  And that\u2019s about the formula that we feel really good about.","Kathryn Tesija ","The only other thing that I would add is this time of year, our seasonal categories can be a big traffic driver for Target, and clearly they weren\u2019t in the quarter, and they were last year.  So all of the things you mentioned, 5%, Pfresh, help us all year long, but during key seasonal timeframes, we need those categories to drive traffic as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig from Citigroup.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup "," ","A lot of conversation regarding mobile and digital traffic.  Can you also talk about what conversion was like during the quarter?","Kathryn Tesija ","Our conversion has been improving of the prior year.  And we were up slightly in this quarter as well.  So we\u2019re really pleased with improvements that we\u2019ve made on the site, but I\u2019ll tell you, we still feel we have a long way to go with conversion, and we are very committed to continuing to work on our navigation and our search function, the basic functionality of our site, to continue to make big improvements there.","John Mulligan ","I think the other thing I\u2019d add there is we have a little bit of a mixed headwind, which is positive from our perspective.  Mobile, in general, has a much lower conversion rate than the site, and our mobile is growing much, much faster than the site.  We think that\u2019s good, because we think that\u2019s where things are going, and it also shows that she is spending a lot of time with us on the mobile applications we have, but conversion\u2019s just naturally lower there, so it creates a little bit of a mixed number as we look at the aggregate.  ","Kathryn Tesija ","So if you look at conversion on our site, it\u2019s up to last year.  If you look at conversion on mobile, it\u2019s up to last year, but because of the big growth in mobile, to John\u2019s point, conversion comes down slightly in aggregate.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","And then maybe just a broader question.  Can you just talk about how you\u2019re positioning yourself in terms of taking advantage of the Affordable Care Act?","John Mulligan ","I think we\u2019ve said a couple of times the Affordable Care Act, the changes for us will not be material externally.  We\u2019re still continuing to work through all the regulations and we are hopeful that we will exactly do, but it won\u2019t be material changes to what we\u2019re doing today, or financially, from a financial perspective.   ","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","And I think Gregg touched on segmentation and how you\u2019re looking to match local tastes and preferences.  Where are you?  I know there was a lot of work done in Canada, but where are you domestically in terms of that?","Gregg Steinhafel ","We feel good about where we are.  We\u2019ve been working on this for a long time, and we continue to deploy resources to get better and better at that.  This is just a long term initiative that we have to continue to focus on, whether it\u2019s in food, whether it\u2019s demographics, whether it is ethnic groups.  We\u2019ve just got to continue to get better at our localization efforts.  And we think we\u2019ve made good progress there, and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on it.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","Was there anything that you learned from Canada that you could go back and apply to the U.S.?  Or was it exactly what you expected, and you\u2019re just continuing on the path?","Kathryn Tesija ","I would just say it\u2019s a little early to learn from Canada and bring that back to the U.S.   I will tell you, though, we learned a lot from City Target that we have applied to Canada.  So as you know those stores are in dense, urban areas, and so are our Canada stores.  So we took a lot of that learning and the testing that we did last year and applied that to what we\u2019re doing in Canada.  And throughout this year, of course, we\u2019ll be reading the Canada results and bringing that back to the U.S. But the same teams work on localization for both countries.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","First, on the top line, in the home and apparel categories, can you talk about the stacked comps that you had in the first quarter and broadly how those categories have trended over time, the past few quarters?"," ","Kathryn Tesija ","When we looked at the stack comps, we feel a lot better about it, just looking at this quarter.  Both were positive, if we look on a stack basis.  Going forward, our compare in second quarter is not nearly as difficult as our first quarter, so we would expect our comps to improve.  And over time, we want that two-year stack to improve.  We\u2019re not happy with flat or up slightly.  We want to make sure that we\u2019re making progress there.  But it was, on a two-year basis, better.","John Mulligan ","Apparel, for instance, the two-year stack is around a 2.  Running that consistently through time, we\u2019d feel really good about running 2s in apparel.  And as Kathy said, home is positive, and that\u2019s a big improvement from where home has been over the past several years.  So on a two-year basis, we feel good about both those businesses.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","And then also, in thinking about the EPS pressure from Canada, can you talk about how much of the expenses in the first quarter are one-time in nature, pre-opens and so forth?  And as you\u2019re thinking about the guide for the second quarter, a similar question.  How much of that expense pressure is actually something that goes away in future quarters?","John Mulligan","That\u2019s difficult to parse out, and the example I would give you is exactly what Gregg said, where we started with the stores staffed very heavily.  We know through time we have to refine that model.  That one-time expense, or operating expense, certainly the expenses related to hiring team members early and training them at the next cycle of stores we\u2019ll open up, that is all one-time, and will drift away.  What I\u2019d tell you through time, we expect ultimately, well down the road, to get to an SG&A rate that makes sense and productivities that are very similar to the U.S.  So as I said before, right now expense dominates the P&L in Canada.  And as we get more clarity on sales margin, operations later in the year, we\u2019ll provide a lot more color about how we expect those stores to operate.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","Just in terms of being in the stores, it seems like at times you\u2019re actually too thin on inventory in some of the discretionary categories, whether that\u2019s home or apparel.  What\u2019s the internal discussion around balancing rate versus balancing sales?  And do you think that you\u2019ve leaned too far toward the rate side?","Kathryn Tesija ","You know, this is something that we are always looking at and adjusting.  But I guess I would tell you I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve gone too far.  Our inventory, as John mentioned, our average inventory per store is flat to last year.  It\u2019s actually up a bit in apparel given the softer sales in the first quarter.  So we\u2019re always looking at that.  We look as much as out of stocks as we do in stocks in trying to improve those stores.  So it\u2019s a constant focus for us, and we can always improve.  But I feel pretty good about where we are right now in terms of in stocks.","Gregg Steinhafel ","Okay, thank you.  That concludes Target\u2019s first quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 25, 2015.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Sorry about the technical difficulties that delayed us a couple minutes there. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.","This morning, Brian will discuss our fourth quarter performance and our priorities going forward. Then Kathee will provide insight in the holiday and fourth quarter results across our merchandise categories. And finally, John will provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","Finally, given that we are hosting our financial community meeting in New York next week. Our remarks today will focus on Target\u2019s fourth quarter performance and our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. At next week\u2019s meeting, we will describe in detail our longer term expectations including full year 2015 financial performance.","As a result we are shortening today\u2019s call to 45 minutes and will look forward to spending another two-and-half hours with all of you next week.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the fourth quarter and holiday season. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks John, and good morning to all of you. I appreciate your patients this morning. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results, which we announced earlier this morning.","Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.50 was 14.9% higher than last year and above the high end of the updated range we provided in our January 15 press release. Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was also stronger than the updated guidance we provided in January, as we saw unexpected strength in our store channel sales in the last two weeks of the quarter.","And of course, we look back at our point of view going into the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth turned out to be nearly double our original expectation. As our combination of products, promotions, holiday marketing, fulfillment capabilities and in-store execution drove profitable growth in an intensely promotional environment.","We are pleased that comps in all three months of the quarter were positive. And November strength was particularly notable, given that we were analyzing a strong increase in November 2013. We are also pleased that traffic was the primary driver of our fourth quarter growth as well as the fact that the digital channel growth contributed nearly a full percentage point to our fourth quarter comparable sales increase.","Our fourth quarter gross margin performance was also very strong, with a favorable mix reflecting strength in signature categories. Our merchant teams did an outstanding job, managing inventory flow, benefiting both in stock and gross margin, which was particularly challenging this quarter in light of the slowdown in productivity at the West Coast ports.","Once again, our store team did an outstanding job of managing costs in the fourth quarter, delivering productivity improvements along with outstanding service to our guest. As I\u2019ve mentioned to many of you, one of our priorities going forward is to harness best practices from our stores and apply them to the rest of the organization, to modernize the way we work and derive productivity improvements or maintaining quality and everything we do.","If we look back at the full year, it\u2019s clear that 2014 was a year of transition in which we begin to lay the foundation for the transformation we will accomplish in the next few years. A year ago, we were in the recovery mode, working to repair guest relationships following the data breach while we undertook an assessment of the long-term prospects for our Canadian business.","Fast forward to today and we\u2019ve ended the year with the data breached fully behind us and that we\u2019ve made tough decision to execute the Canadian business. Our team is focused and aligned on five priorities, I outlined in our third quarter call.","The first priority is to drive industry leading digital sales growth. As we build the capabilities, become a leading omnichannel retailer. Our digital growth led the industry in 2014 and we\u2019re working to build on that success in 2015 and beyond. Our second priority is to clearly define roles for each of our merchandise categories and build appropriate plans for each of them.","While we\u2019re in the early stages of this journey, I\u2019m pleased with our efforts, to invest in the growth of our signature categories like style, baby, kids and wellness. These are the categories we\u2019re most famous for, and our guest has asked us to lead with them in the years ahead. Beyond these signature categories, we\u2019re defining appropriate roles for each of our categories. And we\u2019ll invest in them appropriately to ensure we\u2019re providing our guests convenience through a differentiated, inspirational and one-stop shopping experience.","Our third priority is to become much more localized in the assortment and experience we provide in our stores, and more personalized in our digital interaction with our guest. We are in the very early stage of these efforts, and we see huge opportunity ahead of us. So we\u2019re investing these capabilities we\u2019ll need to make progress on this priority over the next few years.","Our fourth priority is to build and test new formats that will help us better serve our guests over time. We\u2019re seeing strong financial results from our eight City Target stores and we\u2019ve seen very strong initial performance in the test of our first Target Express location, which opened here in the Twin Cities last August.","In 2015, of the 15 new stores we\u2019re planning to open more than half of these are new formats with eight additional express stores and a new City Target set to open in Boston, next to Fenway Park. And finally, we\u2019re committed to reducing complexity and controlling costs in order to fuel our investments and the growth priorities I\u2019ve just outlined.","As mentioned earlier, our stores have been leading the way in these efforts. So the next few years, we are looking for opportunities outside our stores, become more agile, move faster, gain scale efficiencies in the way we work. We believe meaningful opportunities exist. And the leadership team is committed to moving decisively. The modernized way we work and create the capacity we will need to invest in the priorities that will drive growth and return on invested capital.","At our meeting with you next week, we are looking forward to providing you more specific on how we\u2019re planning to advance these five priorities, while providing insight in how our plans will translate in the financial results, both this year and over the long-term.","Our plan for the day is as follows, I\u2019ll lead off the day by providing details on our strategic priorities, our approach to growth, and the principles guiding our leadership team, as we work to deliver on these priorities. Then, John, will provide more detail on our financial expectations for each line of the P&L going forward. And he will provide full year guidance for 2015 financial results from continuing operations, reflecting our plan to grow earnings per share this year.","Casey Carl will follow with details on our digital progress and his plans to transform the organization by developing new capabilities that will support our growth, control cost, and recapture the innovated spirit that\u2019s part of the company\u2019s DNA. Then, Kathee Tesija will provide more insights into our core guests and our plan to develop products, experience and formats to serve those guests over time.","And then Jeff Jones will provide insight into the guest relationship with the Target brand, and his team\u2019s work to modernize our marketing and the way we interact with today\u2019s core guest. Finally, we\u2019ll end with a Q&A session.","We are looking forward to the opportunity to share these plans with you next week, and we\u2019re confident that we can build on the early momentum we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. We have a fantastic foundation to build on with a great brand, loyal guests, and an outstanding team. And we are committed to maintaining our focus on our key priorities, and making the tough decisions to position Target for long-term success.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathee, to recap our fourth quarter and holiday season performance. Kathee?","Kathee Tesija","Thanks, Brian. Across the U.S. retail landscape, this year\u2019s holiday shopping season began earlier and ended later than ever before. This lengthening of the season reinforced a pattern we\u2019ve seen for well over a decade, where we saw the strongest sales in the early and late portions of the season and experienced a period of softness in the middle.","Specifically, throughout November, our comparable sales performance, including the Black Friday weekend was very strong on both the one-year and two-year basis, driven by strong promotions throughout the month, combined with in-store events and Cartwheel daily deals. In December, following the characteristic lull that we have seen for more than a decade we saw a very strong surge in traffic and sales in the days leading up to and after Christmas.","And in January, we continue to see unexpected strong results throughout the month. As Brian mentioned, we saw particularly strong trends in fourth quarter sales in our signature categories. Specifically, healthcare, beauty, apparel and home, all grew faster than our overall sales.","Within apparel, results were strongest in baby and kid, and home comps were led by domestics and seasonal items. In hard lines, our toy category had a fantastic quarter recording a double-digit increase in comparable sales driven by a strong line up of Target exclusive items throughout the assortment.","Average retails, were up across all of our categories, as guests were trading up within assortments and we saw strong regular price sell-throughs in seasonal and markdown sensitive categories.","Digital channel growth also contributed to the growth in the average retail, particularly in home and apparel, both of which saw digital channel penetration growth of more than a percentage point in the fourth quarter.","Throughout the holiday season, we were very pleased with the performance of our fourth quarter limited time partnerships with TOMS and Faribault Woolen Mill. Guests responded to the stories behind these brands, and were delighted by the combination of quality and price we could deliver.","I already mentioned the great quarter in toys, which we supported this year with the launch of our Kid\u2019s Wish List app. A fun, interactive way for kids to let their families know which gifts were at the top of their list.","We saw strong guest engagement with this new app, as nearly half the families who used it, created a list for two or more kids. And by the end of the season, thousands of new target.com accounts had been created by Wish List users.","Our attention getting offer to ship all digital orders for free during the holiday season provided compelling value and convenience to our guests. The offer created a surge in traffic and conversion on both our conventional site and mobile, which as expected, was partially offset by a moderate decline in average transaction size.","Because our guest responded so well to this holiday promotion. We were excited earlier this week to announce that going forward we are reducing the order threshold for free shipping from $50 to $25 with virtually no exclusions.","This new minimum is among the most compelling offers in digital retailing, putting us ahead of many of our key competitors. In our digital channel for the fourth quarter overall, we saw a high single-digit increase in visits, driven entirely by growth in mobile which includes both tablets and smartphones.","Orders were up well over 50% driven by very strong conversion increases on both the conventional site and mobile. Mobile is becoming increasingly important to all digital retailers and given the profile of our guests, it\u2019s particularly important for Target, as mobile accounted for more than 40% of our digital orders in the fourth quarter. And notably on Black Friday, 10% of our iPhone app revenue was from guests purchasing on their phone while they were simultaneously shopping one of our stores.","Our flexible fulfillment efforts play a key role in supporting our digital growth, and we\u2019re pleased with results of our store pickup program and our recent roll out of ship-from-store capability. This is the second holiday season in which we\u2019ve offered store pickup. And since last year, we\u2019ve added more dry grocery items, extended the pickup window from two days to four days and we\u2019ve begun testing dedicated parking spots.","This year we had more than 400,000 store pickup orders on the Black Friday week alone. And they accounted for half of our digital traffic in the last four days leading up to Christmas. For the year in total, 84% of store pickup orders where picked on time and 35% of the time guests who picked up a digital order also shopped the store on the same visit.","This is our first holiday season with ship-from-store capabilities having rolled out to a 139 stores at the end of the third quarter. This capability allows us to ship more than 60,000 items directly from stores to our guest\u2019s front doors, dramatically cutting shipping times while reducing our shipping costs.","We were pleased with the ability of this initial group of stores to handle the shipments from their back rooms which peaked in the last week of November. And importantly this capability allowed us to continue to fulfill holiday orders late in the season for items which were already sold through in our fulfillment centers, but still available in our stores allowing us to capture incremental sales.","Before I move to our plans going forward, I want to pause and discuss the situation at the West Coast ports. As you know, the slow down at these ports began several months ago and our fourth quarter performance clearly demonstrates that our team was effective in handling this slow down by rerouting, expediting and preordering inventory to support in stock.","We were very pleased with last weekend\u2019s news that a tentative agreement had been reached, but what we know it will be sometime before the backlog at these ports will be fully eliminated. In the mean time, we have contingency plans to continue to work around potential issues. But at times, we may encounter periods of light inventory in some assortments.","Now I want to give you a few highlights of our plans going forward, and of course we will have much more to cover with you next week. Last year, we began to test and roll out a variety of store presentation, innovations to elevate the shopping experience and differentiate our brand based on the guest response to these changes, we\u2019re planning to accelerate our roll out in 2015.","For example, following the addition of Mannequins at the apparel floor pad, in more than 600 stores last fall, we are planning to roll them out to another 400 stores this quarter. And based on the guest response to our enhanced, entertainment and electronics experience which is currently in 42 stores, we plan to roll this environment out to another 275 stores this year.","In home, we have begun testing highly inspirational vignettes to show product in lifestyle settings which we\u2019re rolling out to another 15 stores this quarter. Farther back in the testing phase, we are looking at innovations to bring even more fun to our toy area. With easier navigation, interactive experiences, larger than life displays, and floor graphics. We\u2019re always looking for creative platforms to engage guests in new ways that are meaningful to them.","Snapchat provides a fun channel for us to quickly share exclusive behind the scenes content with our guests that they can\u2019t get anywhere else. If you were one get anywhere else. If you were one of the fans who witnessed Target\u2019s Snapchat debut, you caught a glimpse of the first story which teased our history- making Grammy commercial with Imagine Dragons, to announce the Target exclusive version of their new album containing four exclusive bonus tracks.","Jeff will have more to say about this groundbreaking Grammy moment at our meeting next week. Guests are excited about the recent launch of our new plus-sized brand Ava & Viv which launched earlier this month. Designed by our own product design and development team, Ava & Viv feature stylish basics, along with trend-driven statement pieces. Similar to Target\u2019s other apparel lines, Ava & Viv will be updated monthly, with prices ranging from $10 to $80.","And the anticipation is building for our upcoming partnership with Lilly Pulitzer. With a modern interpretation of the American resort wear brand\u2019s exuberant prints and patterns, the limited edition Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection features 15 exclusive prints, which are original works of art created by Lilly Pulitzer artists specifically for this modern collaboration.","Available exclusively at all Target stores in the U.S. And on target.com beginning April 19, 250-piece collection includes apparel, accessories and shoes for women and girls, as well as home accents, outdoor entertaining accessories, beach gear, travel essentials, and more.","And finally, as Brian mentioned, wellness is one of the signature categories in which we\u2019re investing to differentiate our brand and our assortment from competition. We have a huge opportunity in this space, because our guests have told us it\u2019s particularly important to them.","Specifically, nearly every household that shops at Target buys natural and organic products, and more than half of them indicate that they\u2019d prefer to purchase natural and organic products when available. These guest insights are reinforced by their behavior in our stores. While overall sales in the natural and organic industry are growing rapidly, sales of these categories at Target are growing even faster, outpacing the industry by 50% in 2014.","The Made to Matter collection remains one of the most prominent and active examples of Target\u2019s focus on wellness. Offering guests a selection of natural, organic, and sustainable products across multiple categories. In 2014, sales of the brands featured in our Made to Matter collection grew twice as fast at Target than they did elsewhere in the market.","In 2015, we\u2019ll reinforce our commitment to newness and better for you choices with a refreshed Made to Matter hand picked by Target collection. This year\u2019s collection will double in size compared to last year, delivering more than 200 new and exclusive products from 31 leading and upcoming brands.","As we look ahead to the New Year, our priorities in merchandising are clear. We will build appropriate plans for each of our categories, based on the role they play in supporting our brand and delivering a superior shopping experience. In our signature categories, we will invest in product development, marketing, fixtures and store service to elevate and differentiate both the assortments and the shopping experience.","Fully delivering on our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise, our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we are making some early progress in this work, and we are dedicated to moving much faster in this transformation in 2015. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our fourth- quarter financial performance and our outlook for first quarter 2015. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Kathee. Our first quarter financial results were stronger than expected, driven by better than expected sales performance in the U.S. Our adjusted EPS of $1.50 was better than the high-end of the guidance provided in our January 15 update, and about $0.11 better than our expectations for U.S. performance at the beginning of the quarter.","Fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.49, about $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS driven by a combined $0.02 of dilution from the reduction of the beneficial interest asset, combined with net data breach expenses. Partially offset by the benefit from the resolution of income tax matters.","Fourth-quarter GAAP EPS losses of $4.10 reflected $5.59 in losses from discontinued Canadian operations. Our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 3.8% was above the guidance of around 3% that we provided in our January update, and nearly double the 2% growth we expected at the beginning of the quarter.","More than all of the sales outperformance in the last few weeks of the quarter was in our stores, as digital channel sales came in a bit softer than expected in those last few weeks, reflecting a slowdown in demand sales growth as we annualized over promotions from a year ago, combined with returns which came in somewhat higher than expected. Even so, digital channel sales increased a robust 36% in the fourth quarter, on top of a very strong increase in the fourth quarter of 2013.","And as Brian mentioned, digital channel growth delivered about 90 basis points of our fourth quarter comparable sales increase, up from a 60 basis point contribution in the third quarter. U.S. REDcard Penetration of 21.1% was about 20 basis points ahead of last of year and inline with our expectations.","As I mentioned in last quarter, a strong trend in new accounts, we believe this quarter represented a trough in penetration growth. And we expect to see a moderate reacceleration in penetration growth in 2015. This growth should benefit later in the year from the introduction of chip and pin technology for all of our REDcards and the change over to MasterCard on our legacy co-branded Credit Card program.","Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 9.9% was so much stronger than expected driven by very strong gross margin rate performance, partially offset by a small increase in our SG&A expense rate. Specifically, our fourth gross margin rate of 28.5% was nearly a percentage point higher than a year ago, and the strongest fourth quarter performance we\u2019ve seen since 2010.","This year\u2019s rate benefited from a favorable mix of sales growth in our signature categories, combined with better markdown rates as we annualized last year\u2019s clearance and promotional activity following the announcement of the data breach. I want to pause here and comment on our inventory position at the end of the quarter, which was about 6% higher than last year.","This increase was intentional, and reflects two separate decisions. First, in the last six months, we\u2019ve chosen to increase our inventory in commodity categories to enhance in stocks in these frequency driving businesses. And second, we are ahead in some import categories in light of the slow down at the West Coast Ports. Bottom line, the inventory increase as result of specific decisions we\u2019ve made, and we feel very good about our overall inventory level as we enter the new fiscal year.","Getting back to the fourth quarter P&L. On the SG&A expense line, we benefited from productivity improvements in the stores and overall leverage on pay in benefits. Offset by higher marketing, technology, and incentive expense rates compared with last year. Altogether, our fourth quarter SG&A expense rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year.","Moving to consolidated metrics, fourth quarter interest expense was up about 6% from last year and we paid $330 million in dividends in the quarter, an increase of 22% over last year. As expected, we didn\u2019t repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter. However, as we discussed in our January update, the exit from the Canadian market will meaningfully improve our credit metrics going forward. And provided the wind down of our Canadian operations continues to push as planned, we will be in a position to revisit the possibility of share repurchase later in 2015.","As always, I will reiterate, that we will only resume repurchase activity if we believe it can be accomplished within the limits of our current investment grade credit ratings. As we look back at full year performance in the U.S., our 2014 adjusted EPS of $4.27 was down slightly from $4.38 in 2013, driven by early year challenges, as we recovered from the data breach.","However, the healing of our business has been evident in the progression of our financial results throughout the year. Specifically, comparable sales, digital channel growth, and year-over-year gross margin rate performance all improved as we moved throughout 2014. And expenses remained well controlled throughout the year.","Next week at our meeting with you in New York, we will outline in detail our plans to build on this early momentum over the next few years. Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter of 2015, I want to cover a small change to our adjusted EPS reporting, which we present in order to reflect the results of operations from what is now a single segment business.","Given that we have now amortized $151 million or two-thirds of the original value of the beneficial the beneficial interest asset related to the 2013 sale of our credit card receivables portfolio beginning in 2015 we will no longer remove the amortization of the beneficial interest from our adjusted EPS calculation. This is because both the quarterly amortization amounts and the year-over-year changes in those amounts are expected to be immaterial going forward.","And therefore, we believe our reporting will be streamlined be streamlined if we make this change. In our reporting throughout 2015, prior year adjusted EPS results will also reflect this change to ensure consistency for comparison purposes.","With that, let\u2019s move to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect our comparable sales to increase about 2%, driven by an increase in digital channel sales of 30% or more, combined with the modest growth in store channel sales. While it\u2019s still early in the quarter, our results for the first few weeks of February are consistent with that forecast.","On our first quarter sales, we expect our gross margin rate to improve 40 basis points to 50 basis points from last year. As we annualize last year\u2019s very intense promotions, which we used to recapture traffic coming out of the data breach. On the SG&A expense line, we expect our first quarter rate to be flat to down slightly from a year ago.","As we expect that the benefit from store productivity improvements will be offset by higher marketing and technology expense rates compared with last year. We expect our D&A expense rate to be about 10 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the impact of continued investments in technology to support our digital and flexible fulfillment efforts.","Altogether, we expect an improvement in our first quarter EBIT margin of 30 basis points to 40 basis points above last year. First quarter interest expense should be approximately flat to last year. And tax expense is expected to be about $15 million higher than last year, reflecting improved profitability and a higher consolidated tax rate compared with a year ago.","Altogether, these expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS representing results of continuing operations in our single segment business of $0.95 to $1.05 compared with $0.92 year ago.","As John mentioned at the beginning of the call, I\u2019m going to wait till next week\u2019s Financial Community meeting to provide specific guidance for full-year 2015 earnings growth as well as our expected financial algorithm over the longer term. This will allow us to present our financial outlook in the full context of our specific business plans, which reflect necessary investments to accelerate growth and build capabilities, along with the opportunity to reduce costs over time, providing fuel to fund those investments.","With that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning. It\u2019s Simeon Gutman. First question on gross margin for John or for Brian, it was quite solid in the fourth quarter, last year you had a little pressure but not nearly as much as I guess we all expected give some of the discounting. So can you talk about what drove the expansion year-over-year in this year\u2019s fourth quarter?","John Mulligan","Sure, I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019m sure Kathee will jump in. I think overall what you observe is there\u2019s strictly some savings relative to last year with clearance activity that went on but I think much more important to that is you saw the acceleration of the signature categories. Home, apparel, style, kids. Many of those with margin rates well in excess of our average margin rate and I think for the first time Kathee and I couldn\u2019t even remember the last time where both home and apparel outcome of the company. So we\u2019ve really saw a very strong mix in the quarter delivered by the product in the stores.","Kathee Tesija","Yes, on top of the mix, I would also say that regular price sell-through was very high. So less on clearance on markdown and more on full retail and which also contributed.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And just one follow-up, I\u2019m sure this will get addressed next week, but can you just tell us what the average wage for full-time associates and\/or part-time associates are at Target?","John Mulligan","You know, we don\u2019t disclose the average wage for our team members. What I\u2019d tell you is the store\u2019s team has always been appointed differentiation for Target and we\u2019ve always prided ourselves and believe we have the best team in retail. So very focused on ensuring we have competitive wages and that we\u2019re developing our team members. We\u2019re all the time assessing the marketplace to determine competitive wages and making adjustments and we feel very confident that we\u2019ll be paying the teams appropriately.","I think importantly, if you look at our team leaders, 60% of them came from team members. So development is a really big part of what we offer to as they progress. Overall as we look at some of the announcements that have been in the marketplace and the minimum wage legislation act really hasn\u2019t changed our view of the quarter or the year really at all and won\u2019t be material changes to us.","Simeon Gutman","Okay.","Brian Cornell","I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to receive this question again next week, but to John\u2019s point, and our goal is to make sure we have the very best team in retail. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest in their development and make sure that from a marketplace standpoint, we\u2019re very competitive with the wages we provide. So I\u2019ve been very pleased to learn that over 60% of our team leaders actually started as part-time hourly employees. That development is critically important. It allows us to attract terrific team members. And as John stated, we do not expect to see any material change next year.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thanks. See you next week.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer","Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on that last comment around wages. Brian, could you just provide some context around how much opportunity you think there is to reduce complexity and improve efficiency in case you needed to respond to wages or you wanted to respond?","Brian Cornell","Well, it\u2019s certainly going to be an area that we\u2019ll highlight next week. I think you\u2019ve captured it really, really well. Our focus right now throughout the organization is to reduce complexity, simplify the way we work, the way each and every day, continue to empower our to make the right decisions that are going to impact the business. We want to create an organization that\u2019s much more agile, that moves with much increased pace as we go forward.","And we deliver the right innovation and product that our guest is looking for. So it is a significant area of focus for us. We\u2019re going to talk about it in great detail. But we think it\u2019s going to be a very important part of our strategy going forward is going to fuel the key growth priorities that we\u2019ve been talking about we\u2019ll go through in great detail next week. But our goal is to make sure we eliminate complexity at Target, we simplify our operating model, we empower our team members, and create an environment where we\u2019re agile, we\u2019re taking advantage of marketplace opportunities, and we\u2019re bringing products and services to market that respond to the needs of our guest.","Matt Nemer","Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on the higher online return rates. Do you think that\u2019s primarily a function of the free shipping offer? Is it more prevalent in certain categories? And is it related at all to error rates?","John Mulligan","Actually, the return rates were higher than our expectation, but they were essentially right on last year. We had seen some improvement throughout most of the year and they basically just returned to last year, so not a material change, just a little bit different than our expectation for the last couple weeks.","Matt Nemer","Understood. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. The first thing I wanted to poke at was frequency. Brian, you mentioned that you were pleased with the frequency going up in the quarter. Is that a focus for the company to drive frequency to the stores and kind of maybe as preview \u2013 how do you get it done?","Brian Cornell","Scott, while there\u2019s certainly a number of critically important metrics as we look at the business going forward, I can tell you that the entire leadership team is prioritized, one, increasing traffic to our stores, and two, visits to our site. Those are critically important as we go forward.","So we\u2019re going to do that by executing many of the priorities that we outlined today. We certainly want to make sure we\u2019re building the right digital and importantly mobile capabilities that drive greater visits to our site and build greater engagement with our guests. Not only when they\u2019re shopping at home but also when they\u2019re shopping inside of our stores. And Cartwheel is a great example of how we\u2019ve used digital to drive greater engagement.","I\u2019m really pleased, and Kathee highlighted the fact that our signature categories drove our growth in the fourth quarter. And it\u2019s critically important that while we\u2019re in the early stages, we\u2019re already seeing the guests react well to our focus on style, on baby, and kids, and importantly wellness. And the fact that healthcare and beauty and home and apparel outpaced our overall performance in the fourth quarter is a sign that we\u2019re connecting with the guest and we\u2019re certainly driving more of the traffic because of these great new offerings in store.","So our focus on elevating signature categories we think brings our guest back to Target more often. They\u2019re going to be coming back in to see what\u2019s new. And Kathee and her team have a great lineup in 2015 of new exciting products coupled with an improvement in our in-store experience and merchandising. So those elements are critically important.","We think localization allows us to build a more meaningful relationship with the guest, which will result in more traffic and more visits and certainly as we expand our smaller formats. Both City Target and Target Express, it\u2019s a way for us to engage the guest in these urban settings that are critically important.","So all those are focused on making sure we build greater engagement but the metrics that are going to be important for us is to ensure it results in more traffic like it did in the fourth quarter and more visits to our site. So we\u2019re pleased with Q4. Lots of work in front of us. But I felt very good, as did the entire leadership team that our comp increase of 3.8% in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by traffic. And our industry leading growth in digital was certainly going to be fueled by more visits and better conversion from our site.","Scott Mushkin","That\u2019s perfect. And I just had one quick follow-up. I have a ton of questions but I\u2019ll just do one quick follow-up to what you said, Brian. You did mention \u2013 although Kathee did. She mentioned food. How do you think of food in context to traffic? Then I\u2019ll yield. Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Scott, I think you already know the answer to that and we\u2019re going to talk about this specifically next week. Food is very important to our guests. And they\u2019ve confirmed that with us as we\u2019ve gone back and researched the food category through the eyes of the guest recently. We all know food trips drive traffic. And we want to make sure we compliment our signature categories with guests that are coming to us for the great food products we can curate.","We recognize we have a lot of work to do in food. And Kathee and I were recently out in the market together. We spent several days visiting our stores, looking at competitive food retailers as we begin to build our reinvention plans for food. But as Kathee will talk about next week, we recognize we need to make changes to our assortment, Made to Matter and some of the changes we\u2019re making right now in our assortment that deliver more organic, natural, gluten-free items critically important to the guest.","And we also recognize we have to change the in-store experience and really make sure our food and grocery merchandising compliments the great experience we create at Target. So a critically important area of opportunity. We won\u2019t get there overnight. It will be a multi-year transition. But food is going to play a very important role in complimenting our other signature categories and making sure we drive traffic to our stores, in to our site.","Scott Mushkin","Thanks, that was great answer. Appreciated.","Brian Cornell","Scott, thanks. Hopefully we will see you next week.","Scott Mushkin","Definitely. Looking forward to it.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot, and good morning. If you could frame some of the marketing and technology spending in the fourth quarter, just let us know what that was directed towards. I know you\u2019re holding back to some degree on 2015 guidance, but were some of those initiatives that you expect to persist through the upcoming year?","Brian Cornell","Matt, we\u2019ll certainly go through much more of this next week. I think if you were to look at the changes we made from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter, the big change would have been a significant increase in our digital support of our brand. So as we continue to make sure we\u2019re connecting with our guests, we are connecting with them the way they are looking to connect with the Target brand, digital is going to play an increasingly important role.","And we were very pleased with our overall marketing in the fourth quarter. We had some outstanding creative on air. It received very positive response from the guest. And we complimented that with a very strong digital campaign. So I felt and the team felt very good about the progress we made from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter.","We had created that broke through the clutter, connected with our guest \u2013 drove traffic to our stores. We complimented that with really impactful, digital and online communication and tied that back in with great in-store marketing. So you\u2019ll see more of that as we go forward in to 2015, and we will take you through a lot more of the investments and the plans we have when we see you next week.","Matthew Fassler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Sean Naughton from Piper Jaffray.","Sean Naughton","Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the food question and then specifically inside of the fresh component of the business. This was supposed to be a big part of driving transactions to the store over the long-term. Could you just maybe give us a little bit on, where Target is with its fresh offering today? How is it evolving? And are you happy with the performance with the sales and margins on this segment of business?","Kathee Tesija","Yeah, Sean, we are going to talk about food in much more depth next week, but fresh is a very important part of food, not only traffic and number of trips for our guests, but just in terms of what\u2019s important to them, in terms of wellness. Fresh food plays a very important part.","And as Brian said, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do here. So both in Super Target as well as in P Fresh format, and it centers around our assortment, how fresh the product is, and ways that we can improve upon that, the presentation showing abundance in that great product. So we have a lot of work to do, but critically important to us because our guest has said they want to be able to eat better both natural and organic. We see it in our results today, and we know that there is much, much more opportunity.","Sean Naughton","Okay, then maybe as a follow up here, just on the inflation front, can you just give us an idea of how inflation trended maybe across the store in the quarter and your expectations, kind of in near and medium term? Thank you.","John Mulligan","Sure, lots of variability across categories as always the case. We saw some inflation in food. We saw a lot of deflation in electronics like we always do, but if you look at across the entirety of our business essentially flat to last year. So no net impact to the business from inflation in aggregate, but as I\u2019ve said lots of variability within that.","Sean Naughton","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you look back at the fourth quarter, can you do mention what you think \u2013 how the performance was driven by your own initiatives, the easy comparison versus last year? And just an improving macro environment due in part to the lower fuel prices. If there\u2019s any way you could potentially quantify that, I think it would be really helpful.","Brian Cornell","Michael, let me start. I\u2019ll let Kathee and John jump in. I think you\u2019ve certainly identify some of the big levers. And I think as we sit here today, we\u2019ve recognize that the consumer confidence is certainly improved. Lower gas prices certainly helping the industry overall. We did have some favorable overlaps certainly as we overlap the breach. But I also think we made significant strides from a merchandising standpoint, from a marketing standpoint, and we continue to deliver great execution and service inside the stores.","And when you look at the two years stacks, we had a very challenging November, a very strong November from 2013 that we overlapped and saw growth. And that to me, it was a sign that not only was the consumer healthier but they were choosing to spend their dollars in Target stores. And they came back in December, as Kathee alluded to, we had a very strong close to the holiday season.","But importantly we felt really good about traffic and our performance in January, particularly in the last two weeks of the quarter. So a combination of \u2013 we certainly did have some issues from last year that we\u2019re overlapping. The consumer we do believe is healthier. And we\u2019re pleased that they\u2019re spending in our stores, both in our stores and online. But I also think we made significant strides from a merchandising standpoint. We had terrific marketing and a great digital connection with our guest.","We were able to leverage both an improved in-store experience, the convenience of shopping online and picking up in store, and we had industry leading online sales and we leveraged our stores to help make sure that we fulfill the needs of our guest. So I think the combination of all those elements added up to a very solid quarter.","Michael Lasser","Okay, thanks for that. Please go ahead, Kathee.","Kathee Tesija","The only thing that I\u2019d add to that is, just that, a lot of that focus came in our signature categories, which is why you saw our growth there in particular. Major investment in product, both quality as well as aesthetic and number of SKUs, newness that we brought to the market. The marketing reinforce that, and that was very well received by our guests. And then coupled with presentation both online with enhancements in app and our desktop site, and the presentation in our store driven by focus on signature categories really helped drive our growth.","Michael Lasser","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. The follow up question I had is, are there any particular call outs you can offer about the strength in the last two weeks of the quarter? It just strikes as interesting and we\u2019re curious about what drove that strength. Thank you.","John Mulligan","I think we continue to see gift card redemption. We intentionally \u2013 we had a significant gift card promotion on Black Friday that was very successful. We saw all of those come back in January. I think that helped. And we saw continued strength in the product in home and apparel, very strong sales in home and apparel and I think that was an element of it as well. I think it\u2019s a combination of both.","Kathee Tesija","And our wellness business is healthy as we turn the corner in to the New Year, we saw that continue. So that the trade up that we had seen during Christmas. We saw continuing in to January which is just guest choice for products in our discretionary categories. I think lots of things drove it.","Brian Cornell","Michael, I think, well summarized, I\u2019d put four elements on the list. John talked about gift cards. I think that was very important. And we certainly saw our guest come back to Target with gift cards after the holidays and through January. Our focus on wellness certainly well received by the guest. We had great newness in our stores to start the New Year. And our store teams did a terrific job of recovering after the holidays. And we offered our guests a very strong in-store shopping experience. So a lot of the basics.","But our gift card plans were well executed. We saw the guests come back in January. Our focus on wellness that important signature category, well received. We brought newness into the stores to start the year. And our store teams did a terrific job of recovering after a very busy Christmas holiday season.","Michael Lasser","Thank you so much, I appreciate it.","Brian Cornell","Thank you. I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question today.","Operator","Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great. Thanks. I had a couple of follow-ups. It would be great to know \u2013 you said the signature categories did well. Do you have the actual numbers like which ones were better by category for food and wellness, et cetera?","Kathee Tesija","Well, health and beauty were both very strong. In the health categories, that spread across many categories. I talked about Made to Mat ter. I talked about better for you product in food. But it was also in our health business. And our style business both beauty was strong as well as in apparel it was driven really by kids and by babies. And in home it was domestics and seasonal product. Then in kids, we had incredible season in toys with a double-digit comp. We really were pleased with the overall holiday.","John Mulligan","Greg, as we mentioned earlier in the call, wellness, home, apparel all comped in excess of the 3.8 we reported for the quarter, so strength across all those categories. And to win in the fourth quarter you have to win in toys. Well, our team won in toys, and showing a double-digit comp was critically important. So we felt very good about the early progress in those signature categories. And we\u2019ll build off of that momentum as we go into 2015.","Greg Melich","And maybe to follow-up on that momentum and seeing the traffic get back to up 3%. When you look after your first quarter, that 2% expectation, do you expect traffic to be half of that comp or positive in the first quarter? Or what was built in your expectation?","John Mulligan","I think, Brian, hit on in earlier, right. We continue to drive for positive traffic. I think positive in the store and growing digital online and that\u2019s part of our guidance.","Greg Melich","Great. And then, John, may be a quick follow-up on SG&A, it looked it and I could be backing the math out wrong here, but SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter accelerated to maybe 4% or 5% growth. Was there anything that caused that in particular?","John Mulligan","Yeah, I think like we said, a little bit of deleveraging. There was some marketing expense we talked about in November, moved from November into \u2013 or from Q3 into Q4. As Brian said, we made some investments in marketing. The other elements were ongoing all year. We had some technology. The thing that really drove a lot of it relative to the other quarters was incentive expense. We clearly out delivered our expectations and that will be reflected in our incentive expense.","Brian Cornell","Thanks for joining us today. That\u2019s going to conclude our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation today and we really look forward to seeing you next week in New York City, so thank you again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conference call. Thank you for participating at this time. You may now disconnect."],"20453":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q3 2019 Results Conference Call November 20, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","John Hulbert - VP, IR","Brian Cornell - Chairman and CEO","John Mulligan - COO","Michael Fiddelke - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Chris Horvers - JP Morgan","Michael Lasser - UBS","Matt McClintock - Raymond James","Scott Mushkin - R5 Capital","Ed Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Kate McShane - Goldman Sachs","Karen Short - Barclays","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 20, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call.","On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer, and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer.","In a few moments, Brian, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our third quarter performance, and our plans and financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","This morning, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.","And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the reminder of the year. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. We are really pleased with our third quarter financial results, which were well ahead of our expectations on nearly every measure. Comparable sales grew 4.5% in the quarter, about a point ahead of our guidance, driven by an acceleration of sales in our stores. This comp performance is on top of 5.1% in last year's third quarter, meaning that we've grown our comparable sales nearly 10% over the last two years. Third quarter profitability was also stronger than expected, driven by a much larger than expected increase in our gross margin rate. With this upside, operating margin dollars increased more than 22% compared with a year ago, resulting in a nearly 25% increase in adjusted EPS.","In light of this performance and our updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we raised the midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS expectations by $0.30. This reflects really strong performance, well ahead of our expectations going into 2019, and t demonstrates the power of the durable, operational, and financial model we've been developing over the last several years. None of these results would be possible without the amazing efforts of our team, who have designed and implemented meaningful changes across multiple parts of our business from our store service and operating model to our unmatched digital fulfillment capabilities, and our inventory replenishment routines.","And while there's much more to do, it's incredibly gratifying to see how these efforts are already driving outstanding operational and financial performance. When we analyze the components of our comp sales, we're pleased that traffic continues to be the primary driver of our growth. Overall, our traffic grew 3.1% in the third quarter, as our guests chose to shop with us more often, both in stores and through our digital options. Among our sales channels, store comps were up 2.8% in the quarter, more than 1 percentage point faster than the second quarter, while digital comps grew 31% and drove 1.7 percentage points of the Company's comp growth.","Notably, this year's digital growth was on top of a 49% comp increase last year. While these numbers add up to 80%, when you're talking about growth rates of this magnitude, the power of compounding really matters. Specifically, when you do the math, you'll see that our third quarter digital comp sales have actually grown more than 95% over the last two years. Within our digital sales, 80% of our third quarter growth was driven by same-day fulfillment options, in-store Pick Up, Drive Up, and Shipt. Given that these same-day options rely on our store assets, team, and inventory, they are much more profitable than traditional ecommerce fulfillment.","As we look back at trends within the quarter, we continue to see the benefit of our balanced multi-category assortment, which gives us the flexibility to lean into different seasons and important moments in our guests\u2019 lives. At the beginning of the quarter, we enjoyed favorable results in our back-to-school and back-to-college assortment. And later in the quarter, as colder weather spread across the country, we saw a rapid acceleration in sales of our weather-sensitive categories.","Beyond these seasonal moments, we continue to benefit from our frequency categories; food and beverage, essentials and beauty, which drive everyday traffic, guest engagement and sales. We're happy to see continued broad market share gains across many of our core merchandising categories. Apparel saw the most dramatic share gains in the quarter, with comp sales growth of more than 10%. This was driven by even stronger trends in jewelry, accessories and shoes, intimates and sleepwear, young contemporary and women's ready to wear.","In the home category, which was annualizing really strong growth a year ago, we saw a low-single-digit comp increase in the third quarter, driven by strength in the kitchen and home storage categories. Among our frequency categories, we continue to benefit from amazing strength in beauty and cosmetics, which delivered high-single-digit comp growth in the quarter. We also saw high-single-digit growth in our over-the-counter assortment and mid-single-digit growth in household essentials and paper products.","Within our hardline categories, we saw particular strength in mobile and continued growth in toys, offset by comp sales declines in electronics and entertainment. And finally, in food and beverage categories, we saw a low-single-digit comp increase led by double-digit growth in adult beverages, along with strength in non-alcoholic beverages and in our bakery and deli areas.","In September, we were excited to launch our new food and beverage owned brand, Good & Gather. The idea behind the brand is simple: Great food made for real life. Good & Gather incorporates simple, high quality ingredients without any artificial flavors, synthetic colors, artificial sweeteners, or high fructose corn syrup. We saw encouraging results from our launch of 650 items during the quarter and expect that Good & Gather will become our largest owned brand once we roll out the full 2,000-item assortment by the end of next year.","Across all of our merchandising categories, we continue to focus on delivering newness and innovation, combining the best national brands with a powerful set of owned and exclusive brands. Early in the third quarter, we announced a new creative collaboration with Disney, designed to bring the magic of Disney to the joy of shopping at Target. We launched 25 Disney stores within select Target locations last month, featuring an immersive experience and an enhanced Disney assortment of more than 450 items, including more than 100 items that were previously available only at Disney retail locations. Beyond those markets, we offer this extended assortment to all of our guests through the Disney store on Target.com, and the Target app. We'll expand this collaboration to another 40 locations with a Disney shop-in-shop in 2020, and we're planning a new Target location on the Walt Disney World property in 2021.","And of course, the fourth quarter will benefit from Target Circle, our new loyalty program that launched nationwide last month. Even though the program is brand new, Target Circle already has more than 35 million members making it America's fastest growing loyalty program. ","During an 18-month test period, guests enrolled in Target Circle saved more, shopped more frequently, and spent 2% to 5% more than guests who weren\u2019t in the program. Joining Target Circle is simple and fast. And in this holiday season, members will receive a number of exclusive benefits, beyond the perks they receive all year long, such as earning 1% back on future trips to Target and the opportunity to benefit their local communities by voting to direct Target\u2019s giving.","Looking ahead to the holidays, our plans are designed to deliver the joy of the season, inspire guests with unique items and services, and save them time and money.","On November 1st, we rolled out free shipping on hundreds of thousands of items available for all of our guests during the holiday season. And while Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still ahead of us, we've already been delivering compelling promotions, including the launch of HoliDeals, which will feature throughout the season, and our Black Friday two-day preview sale which was kicked off earlier this month. And of course, for our RedCard and Target Circle members, we\u2019ll be offering early access to select Black Friday deals beginning on the day before Thanksgiving.","Throughout the season, guests will find unique items from more than 40 owned and exclusive brands, including holiday favorites like Hearth & Hand with Magnolia and Threshold. Our home d\u00e9cor assortment will feature more than 2,000 new items and 70% of those items in our holiday Wondershop will be new this year. To make gift giving easy, we\u2019ll be offering 1,000 curated gifts and holiday essentials under $15 along with more than 10,000 new and exclusive toys. ","As you've seen in past years, our digital fulfillment capabilities become even more important during the fourth quarter as they help guests save time during the busiest season of the year. As we enter this holiday season, I'm pleased that Target is the first retailer to offer Drive Up service in all 50 U.S. states encompassing more than 1,750 of our locations. Also new this holiday, same-day delivery with Shipt which offers delivery in as little as one hour, will be available directly from target.com and in the Target app. Additionally, guests will have the option to pay per order, use their RedCard to get 5% off their purchases and receive Target Circle perks. Shipt is now available in more than 1,500 of our stores across 48 states. And of course, free Order Pick Up is available in all of our stores, allowing guests to shop online or in the Target app and pick up their purchases in store with most orders ready within an hour.","For the holiday season, we've added nearly $50 million in payroll compared to last year to ensure that more team members are available to assist guests during peak times. In addition, we've doubled the number of team members dedicated to fulfillment, including the same-day services. So, our guests orders will continue to be ready and as soon as an hour. And to ensure our team members continue to deliver a high level of service, we have invested more than 0.5 million additional hours in team member training compared with last year.","So, now, before I turn the call over to John and Michael, I want to pause and thank Cathy Smith and Mark Tritton, both of whom stepped down from their leadership positions during the third quarter. Both Cathy and Mark have made important contributions to our business over the last few years, helping us to achieve the high level performance that we're delivering today. While Cathy will continue with us for a time in her advisory role, we want to wish both of them well in their future pursuits.","At the same time, I want to congratulate Michael Fiddelke on his new responsibilities. Michael knows our business incredibly well, having worked across multiple parts of our business and operations over the last 15 years. I'd also like to thank Jill Sando and Christina Hennington for their continued leadership within merchandising. With Jill overseeing home and apparel, and Christina responsible for our hardlines, beauty and essential categories, I'm confident we\u2019ll continue to deliver strong performance and market share gains in the fourth quarter and beyond.","As I've mentioned before, one of the things that attracted me to Target was its reputation as an academy company, one that develops world class talent. And in my time here, I've seen firsthand that this reputation is well earned and well deserved. These three leaders are shining examples of the quality of the talent that Target develops. And I'm excited to see what our team will achieve together in the months and years ahead.","Now, I'll turn the call over to John, who\u2019ll provide an update on our plans to deliver an outstanding experience for our guests in the holiday season and beyond. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Brian.","As we approach the peak holiday period, our stores and supply chain teams are energized and ready to deliver a unique combination of inspiration, speed and convenience for our guests. As I mentioned last quarter, our stores have now fully rolled out a new operating model across the chain. This new model is oriented around our guests, not our own tasks, including the creation of dedicated store teams with overall business ownership in key categories like beauty, apparel, home, electronics and food and beverage. The key to this new model is to continue delivering efficiency when accomplishing tasks, but to orient team goals around guests and business outcomes rather than merely checking off a box on a to do list. The rollout of this model has involved a major evolution in the culture of how we run our stores. But, we've been really pleased with the results we've been seeing so far. And we are confident this new model will allow our team to provide an elevated experience for our guests throughout the holidays.","Beyond experience, convenience is important to our guests all year round, but it becomes even more important during the holidays. And this year with six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, our guests may find themselves with even less time than usual. These are the times that are same-day services can feel like a lifesaver. Guests can place an order and our team will have it ready at the front of the store or in the parking lot in less than an hour, or if a guest wants their order delivered to their home, they can request same-day delivery and one of more than 100,000 ship shoppers will deliver their order at the front door in an hour or two.","As Brian mentioned, we're excited that we now have Shipt\u2019s capabilities fully integrated into our website and the Target app, which will provide a streamlined experience for guests who want to use this service. We've been rapidly rolling out Drive Up and Shipt across the country for the last couple of years and Order Pick Up has been available in all of our stores for more than five years. But, as we've been highlighting all year, the growth rate of all three of these services in 2019 has been nothing short of remarkable.","In the third quarter, the slowest growing of these services was Order Pick Up, which grew more than 50%. Target sales volume fulfilled by Shipt grew more than 100%, and Drive Up, our highest rated service, saw astounding growth of more than 500%. Obviously, a portion of the growth for Drive Up was driven by the addition of more than 800 locations, compared with a year ago. But more than half of the growth occurred in mature locations, as more and more guests in those markets tried the service, loved it and chose to use it again and again.","As Brian mentioned earlier, digital sales become a notably higher percentage of sales in the fourth quarter, as guests look for options to save time during the busiest season of the year. And given that we've already been seeing rapid growth in the sales penetration of these services all year, we are planning for them to play a really important role in the fourth quarter. We've made dedicated investments in hours, training, tools and fixtures to prepare our stores to accommodate a meaningful spike in volume of the same-day options during the holidays, while still maintaining the service standards that make them so popular. But, we aren't just focused on enhancing our digital capabilities. As I pointed out before, even in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our sales still occur in our stores. And we continue to see outstanding results from the investments we've made in our stores over the last several years.","In the third quarter, we completed another 153 remodels, putting us at just under 300 for the year. And given our ongoing efforts to improve the process, we\u2019ve realized efficiencies that have delivered spending favorability compared to our plan. Also encouraging, we found ways to reduce the sales disruption that occurs in stores undergoing a remodel, driving a notable improvement in the average disruption compared with last year.","We continue to see remodel sales lifts in line with our assumptions, and we see a meaningful second year lift that wasn't originally part of our modeling for these projects. We plan to maintain our current pace of remodels for one additional year in 2020, and then ramp down to a longer term pace of 150 to 200 per year, beginning in 2021.","In addition to our remodels, we continue to see encouraging results from our investments in new small format stores. We opened seven small format locations in the third quarter, plus another six in November, and sales from this year's entire group of new stores are running ahead of our plan. We plan to continue opening about 30 of these smaller stores per year because they drive guest engagement and deliver strong financial performance, including much higher than average sales productivity and meaningfully higher gross margin rates compared with our larger format stores. And behind the scenes, our teams continue their work to modernize our supply chain, enabling growth and efficiency in an increasingly complex omni-channel retail environment.","One of these investments is in the development of a new inventory planning and control system, which is designed to deliver enhanced precision in the placement and positioning of our inventory throughout our supply chain. The benefits of this new system include lower backroom inventory levels, better on shelf availability of our store inventory, and a higher percentage of replenished items that flow straight to the shelf. We've been developing this system over the last couple of years, and we've been ramping up the percent of our assortment being managed by this new system. It\u2019s currently active on approximately 15% of our assortment, representing 20% to 30% of total replenishment that flows to our stores. For the items being managed by this new system, we're seeing favorable outcomes including lower out of stocks and lower levels of backroom inventory.","We're also testing and rolling out distribution center automation designed to increase our speed and simultaneously reduce store backroom labor and inventory. While the new technology at our Perth Amboy facility is one example of this capability, we're also testing a complementary technology at our distribution center here in the Twin Cities. This new technology is focused on moving sortation labor out of store backrooms, organizing shipments to minimize the number of footsteps needed to restock our sales floors, and reducing the amount of excess inventory in our store backrooms.","We've been testing this new technology, which is integrated into a new warehouse management system in our Twin Cities DC this year. And based on learnings and encouraging early results, we plan to extend the test into several other facilities next year.","And finally, our store teams have been rolling out a system designed to optimize intraday replenishment between our store back rooms and the sales floor. The goal of this new system is to have fuller shelves and enhanced availability for our guests, while simultaneously reducing backroom inventory levels. Since rolling out this new system in August, we\u2019ve seen very encouraging results, including a 17% reduction in backroom inventory units.","Our teams are telling us that their backrooms have never been so well organized going into a holiday season, something which should translate into strong execution during our busiest time of the year.","And one final note, I\u2019ve spoken several times in prior earnings calls about our work to improve processes and drive efficiency in our store fulfillment capabilities, like Shipt from store, Order Pick Up and Drive Up. But, it\u2019s always one thing to hear about these improvements and another to see how they work. So, our communications team in cooperation with our store and headquarters team, put together a video showing how our team accomplishes these tasks and how these capabilities work for our guests. This video can be accessed by visiting corporate.target.com and I encourage you to take a look.","So, before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to pause and thank the entire team, from our team at headquarters through the supply chain and our stores for all the work that has gotten us to where we are today. In many ways, we are still early in the journey. But that doesn't mean there's been a small amount of effort. We've designed and are now implementing comprehensive changes to how we move product, how we replenish our store inventory, how we operate our stores, how we interact with our guests, and how we fulfill their digital orders. Any of these changes in isolation will be big. But, when you put them all together, it's been an incredible effort. In the face of challenges, I've seen our team respond with passion, enthusiasm and seemingly endless energy to move from theory to reality. And today, I'm proud to share what the team has already accomplished and equally excited about what lies ahead.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will share his thoughts on third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Michael?","Michael Fiddelke","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.","I'm really excited to join you on this morning's call, and I look forward to meeting with many of you in the months ahead.","As Brian mentioned earlier, our third quarter financial results were outstanding, reflecting unexpected strength across multiple parts of our business. As a result, we delivered EPS well above our expectations, and we have increased the midpoint of our full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.30 compared with the previous range.","Third quarter comparable sales increased 4.5%, about 1 percentage point higher than both our second quarter growth and our expectations. When you compound this growth on top of our 5.1% increase last year, you'll see the comparable sales have grown nearly 10% over the last two years. Among sales channels, store comparable sales increased 2.8% in the quarter, more than 1 percentage point faster than our second quarter pace of 1.5%. Digital comp sales grew 31% in the quarter on top of 49% last year and contributed 1.7 percentage points to our total Company comp.","As you know, we focus first on driving traffic in our business, because it indicates the continued relevance of our brand and growing engagement among our guests. That's why we're pleased that traffic continues to be the primary driver of our growth. Comparable traffic was up 3.1% in the third quarter, driven by increases in both our stores and digital channels. Growth in average ticket drove another 1.4 percentage points of our comp growth.","On the operating income line, we saw a rate increase of about 80 basis points compared with last year. This was well ahead of our expectations, reflecting multiple beneficial factors. The first was category mix, which contributed about 30 basis points of gross margin improvement in the quarter. This was the result of exceptional strength in apparel, combined with soft sales trends in our electronics and entertainment categories.","On top of the mix benefit from stronger than expected apparel sales, we also saw a rate benefit within that category, as the business delivered a higher than expected mix of full price sales. Outside of category mix, we also enjoyed a favorable mix in fulfillment which took two forms: The first was a stronger than expected mix of sales in our stores, which is our lowest cost fulfillment channel. In the third quarter, all of the upsides to our comp expectations occur in the stores.","In addition, within our digital fulfillment options, same-day services drove 80% of our growth. And as we've outlined in prior calls, these options have much more favorable cost and profit dynamics compared with shipping to our guests\u2019 homes.","On top of category and fulfillment mix, our buying teams continue to develop merchandising strategies that deliver strong margin performance based on our ongoing efforts to optimize costs, pricing, promotions and assortment within each of their individual categories.","In total, our third quarter gross margin rate was up about 110 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the benefits I\u2019ve cited above, combined with the favorable comparison over some elevated costs reflected in last year's gross margin results.","Specifically, as you'll recall, last year, we experienced elevated supply chain expenses in the third quarter, driven by meaningful investments in toy and baby inventory and a rapid buildup of holiday receipts, reflecting the earliest possible timing for the Thanksgiving holiday. This year, given the moderation in our inventory levels and a much later timing for Thanksgiving, we did not experience the same spike in our supply chain costs.","Moving down the P&L, our third quarter SG&A expense rate increased about 20 basis points compared with last year, in line with our expectations. This increase reflected the retiming of both marketing expenses and store labor from the second quarter, driven primarily by the October launch of Target Circle. Year-to-date, our SG&A expense rate has improved about 30 basis points from last year. This improvement reflects outstanding expense discipline across the organization, along with the benefit of lower asset impairments, which are offsetting the impact of investments in store service and training, along with wage pressures driven by very tight labor market conditions across the country.","On the depreciation and amortization expense line, we saw an increase of $45 million for 8.5% compared with last year. This increase reflects a number of factors including base investment trends, our decision to roll out new flexible store fixtures which accommodate incremental peak capacity for Pick Up and Drive Up orders, and the impact of timing compared with last year.","In total, third quarter operating margin dollars were up more than 22% from last year, reflecting the combination of unexpectedly strong sales and rate performance. Interest expense was down slightly in the third quarter, reflecting lower average debt balances, while our income tax provision increased approximately 100% compared with last year. This increase reflected higher pre-tax earnings this year combined with the impact of discrete items in last year's results, which made last year's effective tax rates unusually low.","Altogether, our operations generated adjusted EPS of $1.36, an increase of nearly 25% compared with $1.09 last year. Third quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $1.37 was up more than 18% from last year when we recorded $0.07 of benefit from the discrete tax items mentioned previously.","Now, I want to turn to cash flow and our priorities for capital deployment. And I first want to briefly reiterate those priorities which have remained consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest capital and projects to meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support our dividend, and seek to extend the Company record of annual increases in dividend per share something we've accomplished every year since 1971. And finally, we use share repurchase to return any excess cash beyond those first two uses with a goal of maintaining our middle-A credit ratings. ","Turning first to CapEx, we now expect to spend somewhat less than our original plan of $3.5 billion in 2019 and have an updated spending expectation of approximately $3.1 billion for this year. Savings from our original plan are primarily driven by efficiencies we've realized on a portion of our capital projects, combined with a smaller benefit from the retiming of some project spending in the next year. ","As we look ahead, we continue to expect to invest about $3.5 billion in CapEx in 2020, reflecting our plan to complete nearly 300 additional store remodels for the year. In 2021 and beyond, we expect to moderate the pace of our remodels to a range of about 150 to 200 stores per year. With this moderation and a number of remodel projects, we expect our pace of CapEx will move into the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range annually, closer to the amount of D&A we record on our cash flow statement.","Turning next to inventory, our third quarter balance sheet showed a decline of nearly $1 billion or about 8%, compared with last year. However, given that this inventory position was about 8% higher than two years ago, the year-over-year decline is largely a reflection of the specific inventory investments we made in advance of the fourth quarter last year. As we approach this year's peak season, we feel very good about both the level and makeup of our inventory, which should position us to extend the strong sales and earnings performance we've seen so far this year.","So with that as context, let's review how our capital deployment priorities have played out so far in 2019. Through the first three quarters of the year, our operations have generated more than $4.1 billion in cash, up more than $500 million from the same period last year. We have deployed that cash along with a portion of our cash on hand at the beginning of the year, to fund $2.4 billion of CapEx, paid just under $1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $900 million of our shares.","Over time, the quality of our capital deployment is reflected in our after tax return on invested capital, which we report on a trailing 12-month basis. This measure can be helpful as you evaluate the quality of the Company's business model and the productivity of their investments over time. On that basis, Target\u2019s performance stands tall. For the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, our business generated an after tax return on invested capital of 15.1%, excluding discrete impacts from federal tax reform. This is performance many of our peers would love to report.","Now, let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and how that translates into our full-year performance. Our outlook is based on a bottoms-up view of fourth quarter sales and profit drivers, many of which are distinctly different than the rest of the year. Specifically, considerations in our outlook for the fourth quarter include the headwinds from six fewer holiday shopping days, the benefit from Target Circle, the rapid acceleration in fourth quarter digital penetration, a much higher sales mix of toys and electronics compared with the rest of the year, and the highly promotional nature of the competitive environment. Altogether, based on recent trends and our evaluation of all of these factors, we expect our business to generate fourth quarter comparable sales growth of 3% to 4%.","On the operating margin line, our fourth quarter outlook anticipates a small rate increase, driven by a moderate improvement in our gross margin rate, partially offset by smaller increases in both our SG&A and D&A expense rates. This performance would translate into a mid to high-single-digit increase in operating margin dollars, and an expected range for adjusted EPS of $1.54 to $1.74. And today, based on our third quarter performance and fourth quarter outlook, we raised our full year guidance range for adjusted EPS to $6.25 to $6.45. The midpoint of this new range is $0.30 higher than the midpoint of our prior guidance range. If we achieve performance at the midpoint of our expectations, that would translate into full-year comparable sales growth of about 4%, operating income dollar growth in the low-teens, and EPS growth in the mid to high-teens. All of these metrics are much stronger than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, driven by upside in sales, category mix and fulfillment mix within our digital channels.","At the beginning of the year, Cathy articulated our longer term financial expectations for the durable financial model we have been developing over the last several years. This model is based on the ability under normal economic conditions for our business to generate low-single-digit growth in sales, mid-single-digit growth in operating income, and high-single-digit growth in EPS or better. Based on what we've seen so far this year, we are clearly on track to deliver performance meaningfully better than this baseline model in 2019, reflecting some of the unique dynamics we've seen so far. This out performance is a testament to the quality of the business model that our teams have been working so hard to create.","And the effort of our teams is something we never take for granted. The last couple of years have involved an amazing amount of change in the way our team works, from merchandising to operations, from headquarters to our distribution centers, and of course in our stores. It's been remarkable to work closely with these teams and see how they've embraced the change, believing it's the right long-term path for our business. Results like we are seeing this year are a testament to their efforts and the passion they have for our guests and our brand.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian for some closing remarks.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Michael.","Before we move to your questions, I want to sum up with a few final remarks. Obviously, as a team, we enjoy reporting strong quarterly performance, and the last couple of quarters have been really gratifying. But, the goal of our strategy is to make Target a leading retailer and a world class company over the long term. It's about making Target more than just a good place to work, but an employer of choice, at our headquarters, in our stores and throughout our supply chain. It's about making every Target store a valuable part of their local community, and working with those communities to make them a great place to live and work. It's about making Target a special place for our guests when they shop in every channel. A retailer provides inspiration, while helping our guests save time and money, a company like no other focused on bringing the joy of everyday delights to all of our guests. So, our current performance feels great, especially because it's confirmation that our long-term plan is working. And that's what we'll continue to focus on in the months, quarters and years ahead.","With that, we want to thank you for your participation on our call today. We'll be moving to questions in a moment. But, I want to cover one last item. In keeping with past practice, we plan to provide a post holiday update following this year's holiday season. And the date we're planning on for this year's update is Wednesday, January 15th.","So now, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. You may go ahead.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little more specifically about the cadence of the quarter? Do you think weather had any impact on the business given the warm September? And do you think this was fully made up for given the strong end to the quarter?","Brian Cornell","Chris, we saw really balanced performance throughout the 13 weeks of the quarter. And, I think you saw the really exceptional performance in categories like apparel where we performed extremely well, growing at a rate of over 10%, taking up significant market share. And as I highlighted in my earlier comment, all of those subcategories within apparel performed really well. So, we saw strength in our business throughout the 13 weeks, and I think the team saw really strong performance across all of our categories.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then as you look ahead, there are some countervailing factors. So, electronics and toys do go up substantially in the mix, how are you thinking about those categories into the holiday, but then on the other hand obviously that e-commerce stack was very impressive and -- at least back here in the fourth quarter. So, how are you thinking about the holiday broadly in electronics, toys, and e-commerce as you look ahead?","Brian Cornell","Chris, I think we are really well prepared for the fourth quarter. Our teams have done an exceptional job in putting together the right assortment for the holiday season. And as always, we know that during that holiday period, we're going to amplify our focus on electronics and toys. We're well prepared in those categories with a number of new and exclusive items. So, I think we're in a terrific position as we get ready for the upcoming weeks. And particularly from a electronics, toy, and seasonal standpoint, I think we're going to stand tall.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead.","Michael Lasser","One way to interpret the combination of your very healthy digital growth and the decline in your RedCard penetration is that you're bringing in more marginally attached guests. And now, you have the ability to transition those guests to more regular customers and regular guests. Is that the right way to think about it? And what does the adoption look like as the guest goes from trial of these various fulfillment options to broader adoption?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Michael, I\u2019d start with the real health that we're seeing in overall traffic growth. So, obviously, we're seeing more footsteps in our stores, more visits to our site. I think, that's going to translate into a guest that\u2019s shopping more categories and greater relevance and a stronger relationship with that guest. So, we can try to parse how that guest is changing over time, but I think the important thing is we just continue to see really strong traffic growth, guests shopping more categories. We've talked about the rapid expansion of small formats. We're moving into new neighborhoods. Those are guests that were not shopping Target on a regular basis before, they are now. And I expect over time, they'll be using RedCard. And clearly, they're going to be using our new Target Circle loyalty program.","I mentioned in my prepared comments, while we've only been in market for a few weeks with Target Circle, we already have 35 million guests who were enrolled in the program. So, I think we're going to continue to see traffic growth in our business, guests have started to visit Target, and now they come in for toys, but are shopping other categories and beauty and essentials, begin to shop in our style categories more frequently. So, those are the indicators that I think we look at as we plan for the future.","Michael Lasser","That\u2019s helpful. And my follow-up question is, as you look towards next year and you think about the algorithm that you laid out, will more of the margin expansion inherent your expectation of mid-single-digit operating income growth come from gross margins, like you've experienced in recent quarters due in part to the mix shift to both better categories and fulfillment options, or will it come from more SG&A leverage? And how should we think about the drivers between those two factors in the next couple of quarters?","Michael Fiddelke","Well, we\u2019re not going to get into the specifics for 2020 in today's call, but we feel really good about the gross margins strength we've seen so far this year, and we expect moderate increase to gross margin rate in Q4 as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt McClintock with Raymond James. You may go ahead.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. And congrats Michael and best wishes to both Cathy and Mark. Brian, you talked about apparel for a little bit, but I wanted to dive more into it. Because greater than 10% growth in your apparel business probably means you grew in absolute dollars more than anybody in the entire United States apparel industry. So -- and even if that's not the case, it's an acceleration from 5% last quarter. So, can you dig more into what's driving that? Is that private label brands? Is that national brands like what you saw at Levi's? And what exactly are you doing in jewelry accessories that's driving that growth there?","Brian Cornell","Yes. So, I appreciate the call out, Matt. We did certainly see an oversized increase in market share during the quarter in apparel. I think our teams have done a fabulous job of curating our own brand assortment, really having the right assortment in front of the guests. We've delivered exceptional quality and value in those categories. I think, we've been on trend for the season. And I think our commitment to our new store operating model where we have dedicated business owners in that apparel category that are helping our guests each and every day is really driving great results. So, the combination of the work we've done with our owned brand assortment, adding some new national brands, like Levi's in select stores, the service that we're delivering in-store, and the inspiration we're creating online has really come together in the apparel category. So, I'm really proud of the work the team's done there. I think it's a great example of how our strategy\u2019s come together where we remodel stores and create an inspiring in-store environment, we surround our guests with exceptionally well trained team members, we're providing on-trend styles at a great value, and we're providing a similar experience online.","So, I really, really feel great about the work the team's done there, and I think it's one of the highlights of our quarter if not for the entire year.","Matt McClintock","Thanks for that color, Brian. And then, John, clearly you\u2019re excited about same-day options this holiday season. And I was just trying to think about given -- strategically, given that it's a shorter holiday season than in years past, is it more of a strategic competitive advantage to offer same-day options and do you think that that's actually going to accelerate adoption by customers? Thanks.","John Mulligan","We do. I mean, I am excited about the great progress the team has made over the past year in our same-day offerings Order Pick Up, Drive Up, Shipt, all the investments we've made there to improve the efficiency of the team and their ability to ensure that we have a package ready for you in an hour or less, regardless of how you're going to interact with us. And I think, you're right, when people become time strapped, digital is an easy way and being able to knock it off your list very quickly that day, if you want to pick it up, great; if you just want to swing by, we\u2019ll put it in your car or we'll deliver it to your home. I think that becomes incredibly important.","And as always, I think, the stores are at the center of how we deliver, that gives us great speed. And as you get near the end of the holiday season, the stores become such a huge advantage for us. We\u2019ll be well stocked. We'll have a great team there, like Brian pointed out, providing service. And if you -- again, if you want to order it online, we\u2019ll have it sitting there waiting for you, either to put in your car or come in and grab it. So, we're very excited about the opportunity this holiday season with the growth we've seen and the growth that's in front of us from a same-day perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. You may go ahead.","Scott Mushkin","So, my first question is actually to Michael. I think, you talked about at the end what surprised you kind of going into the -- what the performance is versus what it was going into the year. I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail, why you were above plan and the sustainability of some of those trends. ","Michael Fiddelke","Sure, Scott. Thanks for the question. I think, it starts on the gross margin line and kind of back to the key things from my remarks earlier, strength there, when apparel was running at 10% comp, that's really healthy on the margin line. Good gross margin rates in that category. And we sell more products at right price versus at discount at the end of the season, when our style categories do well. The second was the stronger than expected store sales. That's always healthy for margin. And then, finally, to maybe piggyback on some of what John just said, where our digital fulfillment growth came from. When those same-day options that the guest is responding to drive 80% of our digital growth, that's healthy from an operating margin rates perspective as well on year-over-year basis.","Scott Mushkin","And the sustainability of some of these trends in your mind?","Michael Fiddelke","I think, the team\u2019s worked hard to build an algorithm that\u2019s good sustainability in the long run. When it comes to Q4, Q4 is its own animal. So, we built Q4 bottoms-up looking at all those factors put together. And so, we'd expect again moderate gross margin rate expansion in Q4, but it'll be modest compared to the point of expansion we saw in Q3.","Brian Cornell","Scott, I wouldn't describe it as a surprise. But, I think as you look at the third quarter, I start with the strength in traffic up 3.1%, the strength in our stores comping at almost 3%, the continued strength in digital in our two-year stack in the quarter rounds to 10%. So, we're putting good numbers on top of good numbers. We'll continue to do that over time. But, I think the balance in our portfolio where both our style and essential categories are performing, our stores are driving growth, our digital channels are continuing to accelerate, and the overall composition of the quarter to me with a very high quality quarter, were all factors of our business, were working together as one.","Scott Mushkin","Great. And then, my quick follow-up question. I think, there was a comment at the remodels in the second year performing better than expected. And I was just wondering, if you could give -- some of our survey data is actually showing the same thing. So, I was wonder, if you could give us a reason why you think that's happening and again the sustainability of that?","Michael Fiddelke","We're a few years into this now, and we have consistently seen the second year performance. We didn't expect that going into this, honestly, and we didn't model for it as we looked at the financials of the remodels. But, it's certainly a pleasant surprise. So, we believe it is sustainable because we continue to see it for the second year of the second year, I guess, you would say. So, we're pleased with that. I think what drives it is the guests come in, it takes a little while to figure out the store, we see them engage with the store immediately, because the environment is so much better, the presentation is better. You pair that, as Brian said earlier with the change in the operating model and better service in the store in many parts of the stores, great training for our team so that they can be of more assistance to the guests. And then, we see the guests continue to engage in different parts of the store and really experience everything we have to offer. And so, it's really the culmination of everything we're doing to create that great in-store experience that continues to build as we go through the remodel process. ","Brian Cornell","And Scott, to give you a little additional insight, when we talk to guests who come into a newly remodeled store, and they might have been a previous Target shopper in that store, some of the feedback we get is, have we added new categories? Have we added new assortment? So, because of the changes we've made in the d\u00e9cor, the layout, the experience, they start to discover even more categories than they had shopped before. I think that's a big part of what we're seeing in year two. So, guests might have been coming to us for household essentials and toys, they're now shopping in apparel and home. They're discovering additional categories. And I think that's helping us pick up market share in those remodeled stores in multiple categories.","Scott Mushkin","All right. Perfect, guys. Thanks. I was just in a remodeled SuperTarget in Houston and it was pretty amazing. Thanks. ","Brian Cornell","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ed Yruma","I guess, first to unpack a little bit more on gross margin gains, obviously very impressive. How much of it -- I know you call that apparel, but how much of it you think broadly is from success in your investments and your process in private label and kind of how do you see penetration moving as we think about 2020? And then second, obviously, you've seen some very strong success in same-day Pick Up, I know you're adding a labor there. But, how do you feel about your ability to scale that business from even a physical perspective, either from a backroom or from front of house perspective?","Brian Cornell","Ed, why don't we let Michael start and talk about some of the gross margin gains and obviously, the benefits of the 40 new owned brands we've rolled out over the last couple of years? And then John can talk about the scalability of our fulfillment models.","Michael Fiddelke","Yes. Thanks, Ed. On the owned brand front, it really starts with providing products that we think the guests will respond to. And so, curated owned brand product that drives repeat purchase and loyalty over time. So, we start there. And when that owned brand product does well, it translates favorably to the gross margin line. And so, the strength we\u2019ve seen and the growth of our owned brands over time has diffidently been a positive on the margin side.","John Mulligan","So, Ed, we will -- the way I\u2019d start is, we will pick pack and deliver either in store, through Pick Up and Drive Up or Shipt to guests more packages in the next five weeks than we did in the entire year of 2015. And so, the teams have done an outstanding job of going back, redoing processes, investing in technology, investing in training, reengineering our processes continually. And this year, we've seen productivity increases in pick prep and pack and ship of close to 60% in store. So, we believe we have a significant runway in front of us to continue that. The other thing I would compare this to is if you look at our average store does a little bit over $300 a square foot, our top quartile of stores approaches $800 a square foot. So, we have huge capacity just in those boxes to move far more inventory than we do today with far more team members doing it. Now, whether that goes out the front of the store or the back of the store, it's still just moving inventory through the store. And so, we believe we have a long runway to continue to fulfill. And we think, it is a huge strategic advantage for us, given the speed we see and the cost advantages we see by fulfilling through our stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Kate McShane","Our question is centered around gross margin too. I wondered if you could help us understand your comments, you talked about selling more at full price during the quarter. Can you help us reconcile that with any price investment you may have had to do during the quarter and also the value you continue to convey to your customers?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Kate, why don't I start? And for several years now, we've been talking about our commitment to being priced right daily, and making sure that we're communicating to our guests that every time you shop Target, we're delivering great value. And we've been talking for several quarters now about the benefits of that investment, the benefits of that communication, and the fact that we're seeing a significant portion of our business move to everyday pricing. And I really describe it as everyday value. So, that continued in the quarter. And I think that's going to continue for some time to come as we continue to reinforce to our guests that every time you shop our stores, we're going to deliver a great value, we're going to be priced right daily on those items that we know are so important to our guests. And that's a commitment that's been in place for several quarters and will continue for years to come.","Kate McShane","And if I can just follow-up, I know tariff continued to be headlines at this point and nothing is certain. But, could you walk us through, if List 4B were to put into effect, how much you've been able to or you can mitigate versus how much price you think you'll need to take?","Brian Cornell","Kate, we've been watching the headlines as others have, each and every day. We've been obviously working for several years now to diversify our sourcing matrix. I think, we are well positioned to deal with some of the challenges that could be in front of us. I think, we said the last couple of quarters, in Q2, tariffs pressured us by about $50 million in Q3. That's going to be about a $60 million pressure. But, our teams, particularly our merchants and our sourcing teams have done a phenomenal job of really working through this challenging landscape and allowing us to deliver great value to our guests at a time when they needed most.","So, we'll watch the next list. We'll see what happens as we go into the next couple of weeks and into the start of 2020. But, I think we're well prepared to react. And obviously, we're all facing the same tariff issues together. I think, our size, scale, the sophistication of our team and our vendor partners, positions us well to navigate this uncharted water.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. You may go ahead.","Karen Short","I just wanted to actually follow up on that tariff question, taking the opposite angle. If List 4 were to not be enacted, would there maybe be a little upside to the guidance for 4Q?","Brian Cornell","We\u2019ll watch t carefully. Obviously, if some of the tariffs are pulled back, there's going to be upsides going forward. I wish, I could tell you what's going to happen. But, we're watching the same reports that everyone else's right now. So, obviously, we're going to hope for the best. And depending on what happens, it will give us a chance to either invest in the business and drive even greater acceleration in our trends, but we'll watch it carefully, Karen, and we'll decide once we have greater clarity.","I think, for all of us right now, the biggest challenge is uncertainty. And as soon as we get greater clarity, we\u2019ll be able to make better decisions and navigate these choppy waters. But right now, Target, like all of our peers, we're looking for greater clarity, greater certainty. And as soon as we get that, we\u2019ll decide how to deploy those funds.","Karen Short","Okay. And then, I wanted to just ask about, obviously, there's so much going on in apparel that's positive, and you called out many of it. But you actually didn't mention the 20th Anniversary Collection. I was just wondering, if you could give a little cover on that. I mean, it's we know it's not a huge comp driver. But any context you could give on that and how it went?","Brian Cornell","I think, it was incredibly well received by our guests. I think, our team did a fabulous job of executing the plan. It built enormous awareness and traffic to our stores. And it was just one of those moments where we can surprise and delight our guests. And going back and thinking about the 20th anniversary and bringing some of these great collaborations back to life was well received by the guests. And obviously, these limited time offers will be part of our playbook as we go into 2020 and beyond. But that one was incredibly well received by the guests and a lot of excitement when our guests were in the store or shopping online.","Karen Short","And just last question, maybe a little color from you, Brian, in terms of the merchandising structure in general. Obviously, you've chosen a slightly different path in terms of senior vice presidents and -- two senior vice presidents in terms of the categories. Can you maybe just elaborate a little on that decision?","Brian Cornell","Well, I put two really experienced and very talented leaders in place over two of our big category groups. And this was something that we did all the way back in January. So, back in January, we elevated Jill Sando to oversee our apparel and home and style categories. At the same time, we elevated Christina Hennington to lead beauty and essentials and our hardlines businesses, toys and electronics. So they've actually been in place in those roles throughout the year. They've been with Target for many, many years, in the case of Jill over 20 years and Christina over 15 years. So, they are experienced, talented, great leaders. I have enormous trust in their capabilities to lead us going forward. And, I think that we are incredibly well-positioned from a merchandising standpoint going forward. We appointed Stephanie Lundquist as our leader for Food and Beverage. So, we have some top talent leading those categories. And I feel just terrific about their leadership and the plans they have in place for the fourth quarter and their plans that they're developing for 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. You may go ahead.","Paul Lejuez","Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the Good & Gather line, just the initial response? Also, curious what percent of your food and beverage was private label, prior to launching Good & Gather, and where do you expect that to go over the next few years?","Brian Cornell","So, we launched Good & Gather during the quarter. We started out with 650 SKUs. That will expand in 2020 with another 2,000 items. The initial response from the guests has been fantastic; really, really excited about the offering. I talked about it being real food, not having any artificial colors, artificial ingredients, no high fructose corn syrup. So, I think it's really on trend with what the consumer\u2019s looking for in food and beverage from Target. Our team has done a fabulous job with the packaging. Our store teams did a really terrific job of making that transition in getting these products on the shelf during the quarter. So, while early, the brand is off to a very good start.","And as we've talked about previously, despite our strength in owned brands overall, we're under penetrated from a food and beverage standpoint. So, low-teen development in owned brands in food and beverage, we think there is significant upside over time. And we think within the next year or so, Good & Gather will likely be our single largest owned brand at Target. So, I'm very optimistic about the potential for the brand. It's off to a great start. The consumer really seems to be connecting with the brand proposition. And I think, the best is yet to come for Good & Gather.","Paul Lejuez","And Brian, at what point are you going to do more of a splashy marketing effort around Good & Gather?","Brian Cornell","Yes. We've already started to feature it in our weekly circular. There is some great in-store marketing in place right now. Obviously, as we get to a point of more critical mass, you\u2019ll see a more focused marketing initiative around Good & Gather. But, if you're in our stores today, it's really obvious that we've introduced this new brand, it's featured on our end cap, it's featured in our in-store marketing, and it's a prominent part of our weekly circular.","Operator, we have time for one last call this morning.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Seth Sigman","I did want to follow up on the inventory being down 8% versus flat last quarter. It has been decelerating all year. John discussed some inventory initiatives in growing penetration of the new system. I'm just curious, is that already starting to play a role here, or I guess, how much is a timing element where holiday sales are just starting later? I\u2019d just love to get your view on your inventory position, heading into the holiday and into next year. Thanks.","Michael Fiddelke","John, feel free to add. The new system work, I'd say is a small benefit so far this year. What you're really seeing is the impact of just the year-over-year change from where we were a year ago. If you step back and look at inventory, almost on a two-year stack basis, I think you'll see growth relatively in line with our sales over that two-year period, and versus last year where we were a little bit heavier from an early Thanksgiving and working through just higher inventory levels, especially as we invested explicitly in food, toys and baby merchandise. On a year-over-year basis, you're seeing the benefit of cycling that.","John Hulbert","So, operator, that concludes our third quarter earnings call. I want to thank all of you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you in January. And I want to wish everybody a happy holiday. Thank you."],"20447":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call March  6, 2018 11:30 AM ET","Executives","John Hulbert - Vice President, IR","Brian Cornell - Chairman and CEO","John Mulligan - Chief Operating Officer","Cathy Smith - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs","John Zolidis - Buckingham Research","Oliver Chen - Cowen And Company","Bob Drbul - Guggenheim Securities","Peter Benedict - Baird","Greg Melich - MoffettNathanson","Bill Dreher - Susquehanna Financial Group","John Hulbert","Well, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. For those of you here with us in the room, we\u2019re really excited that you joined us this year in our hometown and hopefully, you found the experience last night, the store tour, the exhibit this morning helped you get a deeper understanding of what we\u2019re working on.","A couple of housekeeping items. First, there\u2019s a couple, I\u2019m going to literally read the slides. First of all, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Second, in today\u2019s remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases and SEC filings, which are posted on our Investor Relations website.","So, finally, something new this year for those of you on the webcast. You can submit questions. I\u2019m happy to say we\u2019re getting questions, so submit those. The team will get those questions to us and we will take some of those during the Q&A session after the speeches.","So, with that, we can get started with Brian.","Brian Cornell","Well, thanks, John, and good morning. And thank you for joining us today in Minneapolis. John, Cathy and I really enjoyed spending time with you during last night tours and reception, and I hope all of you had a chance to explore even more this morning. While we can make slides or show videos, there is simply no substitute for being here, live and in person, walking the sales floor, talking to our teams, touching, feeling and experiencing new products and services, seeing for the first hand the future of Target.","What so exciting for me is that last year at this time all we could do was talk about the future. Most of what we could show were still renderings, today those things are real. The work is well underway. We\u2019ve made a ton of progress against our priorities and as you saw today, our teams are more focused than ever and our guests are responding in kind. What a difference a year makes.","Think back to this meeting 2017. The world could not have looked more different, coming out of soft holiday sales. The headlines were all about store closures, a catastrophic border tax and the looming retail apocalypse. That morning we had a tough message of our own. But one by one many of you pulled me aside that day, said, Brian, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re investing. We believe in your strategy. I\u2019d make the same moves if I was standing in your shoes. It was a long flight home.","But let me tell you what happened as soon as we landed in Minneapolis. The very next morning we gathered our senior leadership team from every part of the country and we grounded them in our company purpose, making sure every decision we made from that moment forward was in service to our purpose, to help all families, discover the joy of everyday life. We talked about where we were and what it would take to continue to build the love our guests have for our brand. We talked about the things that makes Target unique, playing our own game. What it means for Target to really win.","We talked a lot about urgency, getting things to market, testing, learning, doing it faster than ever before and rallying the organization around our multiyear plan, committing more than $7 billion to modernize every dimension in our business and lean into the things that truly sets Target apart, blending the best of our digital and physical shopping experience, reimagining our network of more than 1,800 source, as inspiring showrooms and neighborhood fulfillment centers.","Moving into new smaller markets, creating digital capabilities that bring incredible ease and convenience to our guest lives and doing what Target does better than anyone else in the marketplace, creating great brands at scale and with style.","And we talked about what was going to take to make all that happens, the power of our Target team, nearly 350,000 people all around the world. The connection they have to their community. The passion they have for our brand. I\u2019ve been in this business now for more than 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, never.","The people who work at Target, they love the brand, they take great pride in taking care of our guests and our guest sees it every day. They know the people who work in their neighborhood store. They seek their expertise. They appreciate their hospitality and their friendly service.","When you ask our guests, why they shop at Target, more often than not, they say it\u2019s because of people. So it should come as no surprise that given our teams drive and competitive spirit they never consider a forecast of foregone conclusion. It\u2019s just another challenge to raise the bar even higher.","So last March we told our store teams, if you post positive comps in 2017, well, we told them they could wear jeans every weekend in 2018. Sure enough, if you are in the Target store on Sunday, you saw a lot of denim, because here\u2019s what happened next.","[Video] (6:35-8:45)","I have seen a video half dozen times now. But it still makes me smile. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what this team is accomplished. 2017 was quite a year. We introduced three new billion dollar brands, 10 new brands in all, 110 remodels, nearly 30 small formats, Herald Square, Houston, Hearth & Hand, new payment systems, new partnerships, new promotional strategies, a new mobile app and new fulfillment capabilities. Next day, same day pick up, Drive Up, and of course, tens of thousands of new personal shoppers delivering Target products from shipped.","Early this morning we reported our fourth quarter and 2017 year end results, and you don\u2019t have to get too far to the numbers to see that our strategy is working. Guests like what we are doing. The investments we are making are taking root and they are driving results.","Here are just some of the highlights, strong Q4 traffic, not just in digital, but importantly, in our stores, which led to a 3.6% comp increase. We saw that growth come across our business, as we gain market share in all five core merchandising categories. This was the fourth year in a row that digital grew by more than 25%. But it was our coast-to-coast network of neighborhood stores that enable that growth, as our stores fulfill more than half of our total digital volume.","Given the strong sales performance and the benefits from the recent change in the tax code, we finished the fourth quarter with adjusted EPS of a $1.37 and $4.71 for the full year. But what\u2019s most encouraging to me is that we can hang these results on any one single aspect of our strategy, rather it\u2019s a sum of the parts. Everything working together and everything working that carried the day. While we are obviously pleased with the results, there\u2019s no time for a victory lap, because you know and I know we still have a lot of work left to do.","So while 2017 was all about putting down a plan, getting the wheels turning in the right direction, 2018 is about acceleration, leveraging our greatest assets and leaning in to our competitive strength, all in service of making Target America\u2019s easiest place to shop.","So as many of you experienced this morning, newness and innovation are essential elements of our strategy. Our teams are exploring retail applications for just about every buzzword you can imagine. AI, CGI machine learning and while we are looking for future opportunities to build adjacent businesses and disruptive technology, the vast majority of our teams time and talent is aimed at our core and advancing our investments around several key strategic categories, creating a more inspiring and connected shopping experience, reimagining our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, by positioning our stores at the heart of our network, continuing to reinvent our own brand portfolio and investing in what is by far our most valuable asset, our team.","These are the choices we are making to ensure Target continues to stand out from the pack and further distinguish our brand in the minds of the guests. And today I\u2019m happy to report we are either on pace or ahead of schedule in delivering what we laid out one year ago and it\u2019s all because of our people. They are in every sense our greatest point of difference and that\u2019s true across every corner of our organization.","Consider for a moment what it takes to bring a shirt to market. The buyers, textile designers, sourcing managers, fabric engineers, all the planners, the pricing analysts, the marketers, the packaging experts, the global trade managers and those visual merchandisers, every one of those jobs is held by a Target team member.","The talent and expertise you see it every single node in that global value chain gives us an unrivaled competitive advantage. That\u2019s what\u2019s equally important is the fact that for that shirt when it reaches the store, while our team members who greet our guests and help them find what they\u2019re looking for, that\u2019s why we are investing in training and teaching, not only to sell the shirt, but to sell the whole outfit.","We are also providing new tools to manage task more efficiently. So we have more time for personalized service and we are creating new pathways for advancement, developing new skills and leaning in how to manage, motivate and lead others.","During the past year, we have made great strides in changing our service model and added payroll in areas where our guest expects a more human touch, and of course, I\u2019m really proud of the leadership position we took in October, raising our starting wage to $11 and committing to $15 an hour by 2020.","I will tell you that within days of that announcement, applications for seasonal positions spiked by more than 30% and we had a much stronger pool of talent to hire from. But the benefits of that investment go much further than just the short-term seasonal boost. Our leadership position on wage establishes Target as an employer of choice and we will drive preference for years to come.","And now you\u2019re seeing a number of employers inside and outside a retail follow our lead and today I\u2019m happy to announce we will raise our starting wage again to $12, starting with current team members this spring.","So when we talk about elevating the shopping experience, the work is all about connecting physical and digital, and empowering our people to bring in all the life. Despite all the changes across the consumer landscape, one thing remains absolutely true, our guests love to shop. Our team is laser focused on creating the kinds of experiences that are worth the trip or an extra click.","And you saw that first hand last night, the before and after images or downtown store, well, they tell the whole story. It\u2019s not just about better and more modern design. It\u2019s about creating experiences based on how we want our guest to feel when they shop. It\u2019s about being welcoming.","So in beauty this means making sure our guests see themselves in the product and the marketing, asking for what we can do to encourage them to explore even more. We want them to feel inspired. So in Apparel, it\u2019s not just presentation. It\u2019s about helpful service across the entire experience we also want to make sure we continue to make it really, really easy.","And by no means will then experience look the same from store to store, each day today 42,000 people walk past our Herald Square store during their evening commute. Not one of them wants to walk out with a 50 inch flat screen TV in one hand and try to hail a cab with the other. Every design decision, every merchandising choice has to be made with the guest experience being top of mind.","Now if you haven\u2019t been to our next-generation store in Houston, I can assure you, it is worth the trip. You\u2019ve often heard me talk about the power of [ph] and (17:30). Our new store in Houston is really the physical manifestation of that phrase. It was designed for ease and inspiration, style and essentials, mass and specialty, and it\u2019s a glimpse into our future, not because we plan open dozens of new stores just like it, but because we\u2019re picking and choosing elements from that prototype to create customized concepts for every store we remodeled.","Last year we committed to remodeling 600 stores over three years and now we are going to raise the bar. In 2017 we delivered 110. This year we will triple that pace and do 325 more. We will keep going at that rate, completing over 1,000 remodels by 2020.","We will also open up more small format stores in prime urban markets, including three more tomorrow. And when we put it together, the aggregate investment we are making in key markets like Chicago, LA and right here in Minneapolis, we will exceed several hundred million dollars across each one of those communities.","We are also investing to bring the best of digital into our physical experience. Consider this stack during the holidays. Our stores fulfill more than two-thirds of our digital orders. So now if I\u2019m sitting at my desk and I order something from target.com, but I pick it up on my way home, does it make sense to call it a digital transaction, if I buy a patio set with my phone, while I\u2019m sitting on the store display model, is that a digital sale, our finance folks would say, yes.","I can tell you, our guests could care less and our technology teams, they are working hard to create new tools to completely erase that line altogether. For example, we folded our popular Cartwheel app into our flagship app to simplify the experience and we introduced wallet. So our guest can find deals and pay more easily and faster than ever before.","On target.com we added a 360 degree digital shopping experience. We are investing in augmented reality. We are elevating our storytelling around key brands and key like moments. And we are finding new ways to extend our assortment and better leverage our platform.","So not only are we creating better showrooms at our stores, we are also using these buildings in a profoundly different way. They should be hubs for commerce and community, and given the fact that we are nearly 10 miles from every doorstep in America, we see a huge advantage in leveraging that proximity. We just needed to realign our network.","So a few years ago, we started shipping digital orders from our back rooms. We started small and we worked out the kinks. We focused on getting orders to our guests with greater efficiency, reducing inventory across our network and dramatically accelerating delivery times.","But that was just the start. In August we acquired Grand Junction, a technology platform that enables us to connect third-party carriers and provide same-day delivery service. In October, here in Minneapolis we piloted Driver Up, pull up, pop your trunk, route with your order in less than two minutes, rain or shine.","Then in December we announced the acquisition of Shipt, a technology platform which is allowing us to provide tens of thousands of personal shoppers encloses that last mile delivery gap from days to minutes.","I can tell you I\u2019ve spent time with the Shipt team, talking to their network of shoppers. What really stands out for me is the people. The personal relationships they build with their customers. Think about people who love Target shopping, who are out there shopping for Target lovers. It\u2019s a great combination and John is going to show a lot more details about where we are headed, but I wanted to give you a sense for how we are moving even faster to take them to scale.","Today we are announcing how we are going to expand our same-day delivery service from Manhattan to all five boroughs and several other big-city markets. With Drive Up we are taking our 50 store test nationwide to nearly 1,000 locations coast-to-coast. And finally, I\u2019m really excited about this. We are going to offer free two-day delivery on hundreds of thousands of items on target.com. No membership, no extra fees.","When you think about all the bold moves we have made none was more ambitious than our plan to reinvent our own brand portfolio. We promised 12 new brands in 18 months. Standing here today, I can tell you, we are well ahead of schedule.","In 2017 we brought 10 new brands to market and we are introduced two more, each one focused on replacing long existing brands or filling a wide space in our current portfolio. Think about A New Day in ready to wear, JoyLab in activewear, Goodfellow for men, in home Project 62 and Hearth & Hand with Magnolia, a partner with America\u2019s favorite family Chip and Joanna Gaines.","Each one of those brands delivered exceptional quality and unbeatable value. In a world where everything is increasingly commoditized each one helps differentiate Target and build preference for our overall brand. Across the Board the results have been phenomenal.","[Video] (23:42-24:19)","While each brand has delivered incremental sales, they are working hard across our assortment, driving traffic to other categories and inspiring cross shopping. For example, we were highly intentional about launching Hearth & Hand early in the holiday season. It was an invitation for our guest to explore and an opportunity for inspiration, driving results across home, but also helping categories like food as well.","And while our design and marketing team will tell you we set an incredible pace in 2017. We are only going to move faster and faster in the months to come. Last month we launched Opal House in Home and last week we debut a limited time only collection with Hunter, a long admired English Heritage brand.","So before I turn it over to John and Cathy, I want to finish up where I started. 2017 was a big year for Target. We laid out an ambitious agenda, blending digital and physical, creating new experiences, reimagining our network of stores as hubs for commerce and community, expanding into new markets and reinventing our brands.","We made bold investments, more than 100 remodels, dozens of new formats, key acquisitions, blockbuster brands, industry-leading investments in our team and our team delivered. We are headed into 2018 with a road that couldn\u2019t be more clear.","Our strategy is working. Our guests are responding and we are accelerating the pace, pushing even harder. Moving faster than ever before, three times as many remodels, dozens of new stores, new services, new solutions. Moving from concepts like Drive Up to scale and taking Shipt nationwide and you\u2019ll see us continue to invest in our team and rollout one new brand after another all year long. Putting it all together, this is a strategy is going to make Target America\u2019s easiest place to shop.","So, now, let me welcome John Mulligan, our Chief Operating Officer to the stage. Thank you.","John Mulligan","Good morning, everyone. You just heard from Brian that the Target team delivered on the commitments we made last year and then some, from standing up new stores to remodeling existing ones, rolling out new fulfillment options and expanding capabilities to get products to our guests even faster.","We are changing our operations to use our stores in new ways. While we continue to offer an exceptional in-store experience and it\u2019s all made possible by the teams that bring those buildings to life.","We have more than 300,000 team members in our stores, face-to-face with millions of guests and tens of thousands more behind the scenes, creating, ordering, moving product and developing a technology, automation and tools that allow us to serve the guests in ways we hadn\u2019t even dreamed of just a few years ago. They are the experts, the inventors and the personalities behind every guest experience, and the reason we have made meaningful progress to our putting our strategies in motion.","Just about everything our team has done and continues to do is in service of supporting our stores as hubs. Hubs that offer a great shopping experience, support our communities and fulfill digital orders. They are at the center of how we are welcoming and inspiring guests, and how we are making it really easy for them to shop at Target.","So here is the question I get all the time, in today\u2019s digital world, why invest in stores and for us the business case is simple. When a digital order comes in, we basically have two choices, fulfill it from one of a few fulfillment centers across the country or ship it out the back at the local store.","We are fortunate to have more than 1,800 stores in really great locations, prime real estate, just down the street from our guests. So we can deliver it faster, nearly two days faster than if we send it from a regional fulfillment center. Plus the inventory is already there, because our stores feature a curated assortment we know our guests want, naturally it\u2019s the same merchandise they buy most often online. And when one stores of an item we have other stores nearby that can help fill the order.","Even more, our stores flexibility to ramp up when things get busy is incredibly powerful. This past Cyber Monday our store shipped millions of orders out their backdoors, without that capacity we would need a twice as many fulfillment centers as we have today and when peak was over the stores wrapped right back down. So we avoid spending all that capital on new facilities, we would really only need a few weeks out of the year.","Now that\u2019s all great, but here is the real kicker and probably the thing you all care about most. Shipping from a store is the best way to lower the total cost of digital fulfillment. We hear a lot about optimizing, picking and packing, which can help make fulfilling an online order more efficient. But step back and look at the total cost of fulfillment. There are fixed and variable costs required to run and staff the fulfillment center, but no question shipping is by far the largest chunk.","Going after the variable costs while really important, only get you so far, to lower the total cost you can\u2019t ignore the big dog. Shipping from a local store optimizes the most dominant standalone cost by dollars per order. Because we haven\u2019t sunk capital into a massive fulfillment center, our overhead and other fixed costs essentially go away.","You\u2019ve all seen our strong digital growth and we expect that to continue. So at some point we will need to build more upstream facilities just to manage volume. But we are not there yet. Using our stores to fulfill millions of orders lets us delay those investments or avoid some of them altogether. Because our stores are the fastest and most efficient fulfillment method, they\u2019ll continue to be our preferred shipping point in the long run.","Bottomline, shipping from our stores moves product faster and we do it at a significantly lower cost. I\u2019m confident none of you need a spreadsheet to see that that\u2019s a really good thing. For a company like us with well located assets already in place across the country, this strategy makes complete sense.","But the entire supply chain operation has to support it. With everything we are asking a store to do, they need more product than ever before, we are replenishing the shelves and fulfilling digital orders, all in one building from the same pool of inventory, so product has to come fast and often. But there\u2019s already so much happening in a store. So the trick is to send them only the right amount of product at the right time and quickly.","You all know our team has been building an entirely new operating model for our supply chain. Last year, I told you about our plans to become more flexible in how we move product. The goal is to be able to move inventory in any quantity, whether that\u2019s cases, pallets or individual units. So we can replenish only what we sold.","That might mean sending a truck with bottles of shampoo next to cases of catch-up and pallets of water. We send the store precisely what it needs to restock the shelf. It keeps product from clogging up the back room and makes it easier for our teams to manage the inventory. It\u2019s a model we have been testing with a distribution center in the Northeast and it\u2019s working.","The store is supported by that DC have reduced their backroom inventory by more than a third and cut hub stocks to half of what we see across the rest of the chain. Of course, we did all that with an entirely new facility and we are expanding that operation to support more stores in the Northeast, but we are also testing how to work to retrofit our existing network and by the fourth quarter, multiple DCs will begin the journey to evolve to this small.","To do it we are scaling some of the most promising robotic solutions we have tested in the past year. That automation makes it possible for us to sort and move huge volumes of single units without putting an unsustainable burden on our DC teams or the stores.","With less inventory in the back of the store, we can dedicate more room to digital fulfillment. This past holiday season we tested a new design at the backroom, complete with more pack stations and dedicated space to sort orders for delivery and capacity shot up. It was incredible as orders came pouring in on Cyber Monday, the teams were picking, packing and sorting boxes, just like a fulfillment center. And with enhanced layout and process, they did up to six times the volume of the year before.","Best of all, guest got their packages faster. Nearly every order that came into those stores that day was picked, packed and ready to ship in 24 hours. This year to keep up with digital demand that continues to far outpaced the industry, we are introducing this new backroom design to more than 150 stores and we are reengineering the operation in more than 1,000 others. With this additional capacity our stores plan to ship nearly double the number of packages for Cyber Monday 2018 compared to last year.","That\u2019s good news, because as I said earlier, shipping more order from our stores reduces our costs, while allowing us to move faster and speed is the part our guest will notice. But the changes we\u2019ve been making across our operation these past two years, the average delivery time for an order was nearing two days. But we weren\u2019t doing it consistently enough to make that promise to our guests, until now.","We are announcing today that we are offering free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items, no membership required. With more mature fulfillment capabilities we are updating our promise and resetting our guest expectations of what\u2019s possible. It\u2019s an offer that\u2019s compelling and competitive and it\u2019s just the start.","Speaking of being competitive, one of the biggest leaps we made this past year was our swift moving to same day delivery. With our acquisition of Shipt, Target gain the ability to deliver product to our guests in hours or even minutes. We knew Shipt was a fit for Target right from the start.","Here a start up delivery company that\u2019s gone from one market in Alabama to more than 70 markets in just three years. So the operation is strong and proven to scale. It\u2019s a company built on speed but focused on service, which means working the Shipt we could jump years ahead in our fulfillment plans, without sacrificing the guest\u2019s experience. Staying true to how we\u2019ve grown for more than 50 years. Take a look.","[Video] (35:31-37:42)","Just eight weeks after our announcement we began offering millions of guests the ability to shop online for more than 50,000 items across groceries, essentials, electronics, baby and more, and have those products delivered that same day.","Already we brought Target same-day delivery to Shipt members across the Southeast and in the Twin Cities and we are rolling into new markets almost every week. By holiday we will be the first retailer to offer same-day delivery in nearly every major market.","As you just heard, the beauty of Shipt is that it\u2019s not just a transaction. Our guests will get a personalized service and care that these shoppers offer unlike anyone else. While also accessing a wide assortment of products, priced right daily and delivered in hours. That whole package is something no one else is offering today.","At the same time, guests still like to come into our stores and shop. But for guests in urban areas like Manhattan, they can only buy what they can carry home. Last year, our team saw a need and knew we could help.","Just weeks later they brought a service at our Tribeca location in New York City where guest shop the store and then play a fat -- flat fee, but the cost of a short cab ride, very cheap, very inexpensive to have that order delivered that same day.","Today we are offering delivery from four stores in New York and guests love it. It\u2019s quick and efficient and it\u2019s all possible, because the technology we acquired from Grand Junction last year. The platform assigns, every order to the most logical local carrier, which is what allows us to efficiently scale the service beyond a single store or market.","Starting this spring we will go even bigger in the city, offering the service in 25 more New York locations and reaching all five boroughs by Q4. And at the same time we roll it out in other markets like Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and DC.","Delivery goes a long way in making our guest lives easier, but just as meaningful as when a team member can put formula and diapers right in the back of a minivan, saving the guest from unloading the car seats to run inside.","Last summer we started testing Drive Up in the Twin Cities. It took order pick up to the parking lot where our stores teams will walk the order out to a guest car. We saw the demand for it right away and guest feedback was overwhelmingly positive. In fact, Drive Up\u2019s net promoter score is consistently over 80 and those you are familiar with that metric know that\u2019s incredibly high.","This spring at the same time we take Shipt across the country we will roll up Drive Up putting the service in nearly 1,000 stores by the end of the year and every fulfillment option, shipping, delivering, walking orders to the car, the store is at the center. It also continues to be a destination for millions of guests every week, while fielding much of our digital growth at the same time. So we have to be sure they are equipped to do both.","Brian and I spent a lot of time visiting stores across the country. A little over year ago we toured a few markets together and it was clear, stores that we lean on so heavily needed some love, not only did the design need to refresh and by that I mean losing the neon and the vintage signs, but many of the layouts weren\u2019t set up to handle digital fulfillment.","We walked stores where the team was holding order pick up packages in backroom meeting areas, because they didn\u2019t have space up front, or boxing orders in one of our backroom cranny that could fit a pack station. So our store design team developed a new prototype that would do it all.","They re-imagine the entrances, sales floor and fixtures to make shopping our stores easier and more inspiring. At the same time they extended the order pick up counter, built a Drive Up lane and rearrange the backroom to handle a growing number of digital orders. In November, we open a new store in Houston with this latest generation of design. Check it out.","[Video] (41:39-43:28)","We are incorporating elements of this latest design as we remodel more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three years, including the 325 we will do in 2018. But it won\u2019t be the same in every store, we will adjust and evolve, applying what we learned and leaning into what works and we will continue to design experience that feels relevant for each location, from cinema lights on the former theater in Brooklyn, the big skylights at the store near Sunny UC Irvine.","The fulfillment capabilities our stores gain are critical for our strategy, but so is the improved guest experience that comes from updating a store that hasn\u2019t been touched in years and the difference is real. After stores remodel, traffic grows and we see the 2% to 4% sales lift on average that we would expect it.","In addition to the individual stores we are remodeling, we have made investments in key markets. Take the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Last year we remodeled 28 stores across the metro and guests noticed. The refresh design is inviting guests come back in and to shop, and the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. We saw with Dallas and with LA 25 a few years ago that we can learn a lot from putting our latest thinking into one market. So this year we will go big in our hometown and remodel nearly 30 stores in the Twin Cities, on our way to putting the latest design into all area stores over the next few years.","Even as we re-imagine our existing stores, we are continuing to find opportunities to bring an elevated experience to new guests and we are doing that with our small format stores. The flexible design allows to open in areas where our traditional big-box footprints simply wouldn\u2019t fit, city centers, dense neighborhoods, even college campuses, they bring us into new markets like Vermont, which will officially put us in all 50 states and closer to new guests, like students at the University of Cincinnati and Penn State.","Part of joining a new community is being a good neighbor. So our teams go deep into those neighborhoods to really know those guests and tailor the experience to what they need. It\u2019s a capability we built and refined over time.","You can see that most easily with our assortment. Of course, we have got portable electronics, and mac & cheese in our campus stores. But we also get specific to a neighborhood, even within the same city. Chicago is a great example. The assortment in our Lakeview Aspen store is focused on baby and kids products, because that\u2019s what those guessed buy most, while just seven blocks away Lakeview Belmont over indexes on top selling categories like home d\u00e9cor and liquor.","Last year we opened nearly 30 small format stores, doubling the number we\u2019d opened up to that point. This year we will add another 30. In fact we are opening a few of them tomorrow in DC, Boston and Chicago, and we will do another 30 in 2019, putting us on paste to operate more than 130 small formats by the end of next year. So we can meet the needs of even more guests across the country.","Now all that said, it\u2019s the team inside those buildings that make us Target and our teams work hard to deliver for our guests and serve our communities every single day. So we are continuing to invest in them.","You heard our announcement of increasing our minimum wage to $12 an hour this year on our way to $15 an hour by 2020 and while pay is important our investment goes deeper than that. We are also giving our team opportunities to develop and use new school -- skills that offer outstanding guest service, while also building the basket.","Gone are the days when the team member shows up on Monday to work on Apparel and Wednesday to work on electronics. Instead we are placing people based on their interests and their background and providing data and paid training to help them truly be specialists in their areas. In fact we have committed hundreds of thousands of payroll hours for training that helps them succeed in their jobs but also in their careers.","At the same time we are giving them tools to better serve the in-store guests. Last year we launched an application on the team member device that allows them to order something for a guest if the item they want wasn\u2019t in their store. This holiday season it save the sale and extended the aisle for thousands of guests.","And soon our teams will use the same technology to save guests from standing in line. When the check lanes are full, our team can use the devices to give us more capacity at point-of-sale. They are able bring up a guest\u2019s full order on the spot, busting lines and saving time. It\u2019s just another way they are equipped to make a guest experience easier and more convenient.","We have always said that the guest is at the center of everything we do. So it only makes sense that are 1,800 stores in neighborhoods across the country are at the center of how we do it. It\u2019s why you will see our progress continue to support our stores, whether it\u2019s modernizing the supply chain, standing up new small formats, building on digital capabilities, or most importantly, investing in our team, all of it is in service of delivering a retail experience guests can\u2019t find anywhere but Target. Thank you.","[Video] (48:52-50:05)","Cathy Smith","Wow, just like Brian said, what a difference a year makes. Coming out of this meeting a year ago we were really confident that we\u2019re on the right path, even so, we knew we would be a show me story for a while. We need to begin putting some points on the board to show that our strategy was working and now that started happening. But let me be clear, I know for some of you we still remain a show me story and we remain confident in our path. But I\u2019d all -- but I think we all agree we are in a much different place today.","Last year was the beginning of a multiyear effort to position our business for long-term profitable growth. It was an investment year, as we ramped up our capital spending and devoted a portion of our operating income to reposition Target in this new era of retail.","Looking back, I\u2019m happy to say that we made all of those investments and more, and with those investments our business performed far ahead of our expectations, both on the toplines and the bottomlines.","In particular multiple data points either met or exceeded our expectations, including a 2% to 4% sales lift on average from our store remodels, compelling financial performance from our new small formats, including sales productivity, margins and ROIC, a strong guest response to our new brands, digital sales growth of more than 25% for the fourth year in a row, disciplined execution and a positive guest response to our new -- a test of our new fulfillment centers -- fulfillment options and following our investments in being priced right daily, our guest noticed with our sales at everyday low prices were up more than $4 billion compared to 2016. And finally, the most important metric, guest traffic, it accelerated as the year progressed.","Last year we said that 2018 would be a transition year and that view is still appropriate today. Our priorities remain the same, but you\u2019ll see a rapid acceleration in our pace. To support that acceleration we will grow our capital investment to well over $3 billion this year. To provide a differentiated shopping experience we will triple the size of our remodel program.","We will open more than 30 small format stores and new neighborhoods. We will expand fulfillment options into new markets across the country, including Drive Up and the same day delivery enabled by Shipt acquisition.","We will build capacity to ship more orders from our stores, increasing speed and reducing cost. We will continue investing in our supply chain to enhance the store replenishment and digital fulfillment. We will differentiate with more exclusive brands combined with our curated assortment of national brands. And we will continue to monitor and maintain the right balance of everyday prices and promotions by category. These are important investments to create the Target of tomorrow, which will position this company for growth in 2019 and beyond.","In 2018 we expect that our EPS from our core business will stabilize. This reflects several profit headwinds, including accelerated depreciation resulting from our remodel program, continued cost pressure from the rapid rollout of our new fulfillment options, ongoing wage investments in the face of a tight labor market across the country and the impact of last year\u2019s price and value investments, which will annualize throughout 2018.","However, unlike last year we will expect these pressures will be mostly offset by multiple tailwinds in our business, including the mix benefit of continued strength in our high margin categories, lower unit costs for digital fulfillment driven by our supply chain, modest expense leverage from a low single-digit increase in comparable sales, and of course, continued cost control across every aspect of our business.","And finally, beyond operating income, we expect to benefit from the continued focus on disciplined capital deployment through lower interest expense and modest EPS leverage from share repurchase.","This highlights one of the most important aspects of our business. It\u2019s ability to generate cash year after year. Look at 2017 even with an operating margin decline driven by our investments we generated almost $7 billion of cash from operations. That is $1.5 billion more than 2016, nearly a 30% increase, despite the massive changes happening in our industry. So even without Tax Reform, we would have entered 2018 in a really strong position.","Now let me pause for a moment and talk about Tax Reform. As a domestic retailer we have long had one of the highest effective tax rates around, well over 30% in recent years. So we are certainly encourage the Tax Reform has put our company, our industry on a more level playing field and made the United States more competitive globally.","But the question we\u2019ve heard a lot since Tax Reform was passed, what are you going to do with the benefits? And when you think about that question, it is important to realize we didn\u2019t wait for Tax Reform to make big investments in our business and our team, because we were confident they were the right long-term choices.","Think back to our second quarter conference call in August when we first announced we plan to invest more than $3 billion in our business in 2018 and then a month later when we took decisive action in support of our single most important differentiator, our team. We announced higher investments in hours training to better equip our team to provide an outstanding guest experience. And to support our team members, we announced we would raise Target\u2019s national minimum wage to $11 an hour as part of a plan to reach $15 by the end of 2020. And again today we have made another step forward with the announcement of our national starting wage is moving to $12.","Beyond investments in our team, we are accelerating our capital investments as well. Today we are raising our CapEx guidance to arrange around $3.5 billion dollars in 2018, reflecting the incremental investments in both our stores and our supply chain in support of the priorities I outlined earlier.","So for us the question -- the answer to question, what are you going to do in light of Tax Reform is simple, we are investing in our business and our team to support Target\u2019s long-term sustainable growth, using the same approach we always have.","Now you\u2019ve heard us say it so many times, we first look to invest in projects that promise to have -- to generate long-term value, then we want to support our dividend to extend the record -- our record of annual increases, and finally, we look to return any excess cash beyond those first two priorities within the limits of our middle A credit rating.","So, with that, let\u2019s cover a few details underlying our financial expectations for 2018 and then we\u2019ll talk about the first quarter. Back in January, we outlined our expectations for a low single-digit increase in comparable sales this year and a full year adjusted EPS of $5.15 to $5.45, and today those expectations remain the same.","Among the drivers we expect our operating margin rate will be down about 20 basis points this year, reflecting the net impact of the headwinds and tailwinds I outlined earlier. Across the lines of the P&L we are expecting relatively small changes in gross margin and SG&A in 2018, which together should net to approximately zero.","So in essence this year\u2019s expected decline in our operating margin rate will be driven entirely by $175 million increase in depreciation and amortization. One note, this is -- this expected increase is smaller than I outlined in our last conference call. Since then we have continued to refine our outlook and expect less year-over-year D&A pressure in the year as it goes on specifically in the third and fourth quarters.","Beyond operating metrics, we expect our interest expense to decrease about $60 million this year, reflecting last year\u2019s debt retirement and refinancing activities conducted by our treasury team. And finally, we expect our consolidated tax rate to be in the low to mid-20% range, lower than in recent -- recent history in light of Tax Reform.","Now I\u2019ll turn briefly to our expectations for the first quarter. On the topline, we are planning for a low single-digit increase in our first quarter comparable sales. We are expecting a moderate increase in our first quarter gross margin rate, which will be more than offset by an increase in our SG&A expense rate and we are expecting an increase in our first quarter D&A expense of about $80 million consistent with the outlook I provided on our last conference call.","Altogether, this adds up to a decline in operating margin rate of 60 basis points to 80 basis points in the first quarter, combined with a reduction in our interest expense of about $20 million and the benefit of the lower tax rate we are expecting first quarter adjusted EPS to be $1.25 to $1.45.","One final note on our guidance. As you began seeing in our results last year, our new stores are starting to have a meaningful impact on our total sales growth. As a result, in 2018 for both the first quarter and the full year we expect that our new stores will add approximately 50 basis points to our total sales growth.","So now I want to step back and talk a minute about how our financial model is changing. While we are not going to provide long-term guidance today, we can offer a strategic view. With the changes we\u2019re making to our business model, we expect our financial model to evolve as well. Like the past we will continue to focus on growing traffic sales and profits enabled by our strategic investments we\u2019ve highlighted today, and our stores will be right at the center of that growth, providing an outstanding shopping experience along with fast and efficient digital fulfillment in support of a rapidly growing suite of convenient options.","By placing our stores at the center, we expect our business will generate somewhat higher asset turns and somewhat lower operating margins than we\u2019ve seen historically. This evolution will support continued outstanding after-tax returns on invested capital, something that\u2019s been a strength of this company for a very long time.","In fact, if you think back in our history, this isn\u2019t the first time our business model and financial model have changed in service of an evolving consumer. Remember our company began over 100 years ago as a traditional department store. It had a business model that generated higher margin rates and lower asset turns compared with Target stores, yet even as we completely transformed our business model from department stores to Target stores, our company has generated strong returns on capital for decades.","Even in 2018 an investment year, we earned a very healthy 14% after-tax ROIC and that\u2019s after we exclude the one-time benefits from Tax Reform. This is performance that many in our industry would love. And in 2018 we expect ROIC to move beyond 14% even in the face of increase in capital spending.","As we look past 2018, we don\u2019t believe that margin rates are going to unsustainably low levels and we can clearly see a path to evolve our financial model and reward investors by delivering growth and attractive returns consistent with the long-term record of this great company. We know we serve as stewards of a company that will have a very long history and I can assure you that this leadership team is all in, in sustaining that great legacy we\u2019ve inherited.","So now I want to end my remarks where Brian began with a shout out to our team. As soon as I came to Target I quickly realized how special this team really is. I see it every day that I\u2019m on our stores, walking the sales floor or when I\u2019m visiting our distribution centers are every day in our headquarters.","No matter where they are or what they do, when you spend time with our team, you feel first-hand the pride they have in our company, our brand and the role Target serves in every community we are in.","They share a common purpose to bring joy to our guest lives and they project an infectious sense of optimism. They see clearly that Target will succeed if we focus on the long-term and make the right choices, for our business, for our team, for our guests and our shareholders.","So while there\u2019s no question that times were tough a year ago, our teams passion and energy never faded. Our team embraced the challenge to move faster and think bigger, and begin moving Target from a show me story to a long-term success story again. So I want to say thank you to the entire Target team for everything you do. It\u2019s a privilege to work with you as we write this new chapter in our history.","So now I am going to turn it back over to Brian for a brief wrap up and then we\u2019ll move to questions. Thank you.","Brian Cornell","So I love the way Cathy just brought it all together. We have an incredibly talented team at Target and they truly delivered in 2017. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of their ambition, their passion for the brand and the way they always do the right thing for our guests.","When you think about 2017, you heard it from Cathy and John, it was in every sense an investment year. We made big bets on new brands, new experiences and capabilities. We leaned into new partnerships and empowered our people. 2017 was a year of progress.","As we look to the year ahead, 2018 is all about scale and acceleration. So we are tripling the remodel program. We will add another 30 small formats. We will introduce many new brands. We are rolling out new service models and game changing fulfillment capabilities, and making even deeper investments in our team. And I\u2019m really confident about what\u2019s next.","I\u2019ll be the first to say, we still have a lot of work to do. The competition is fierce. The pace of change is unrelenting and our guest deserves the very best. But I couldn\u2019t be more bullish about Targets prospects.","The strategy we are pursuing is working. Our guests are responding and now our team is more than ready to pick up the pace, and move faster than we ever have before, with one goal in mind to make Target America\u2019s easiest place to shop.","[Video] (1:08:3-1:10:01)","All right. So I am going to ask John and Cathy to join us on stage. We are going to answer some of your questions. In addition to questions in the room here today, we also have questions coming from our webcast. We are going to try to make sure we incorporate those into the approximate 30 minutes we have for Q&A today. So we\u2019ve got mic runners. They will have bulls-eyes in their hand, I would ask as you ask your question if you can just pause, identify yourself, we can see many of you, but not very well. So why don\u2019t we start with sitting in right up front. I can see up to about the second, so it was an advantage.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks, Brian.","Brian Cornell","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","I want to focus on two items that I have been pressuring margins, first, investments and capabilities, investments being the catchall including wage? And then the second pressure point is the shift to lower margin channel and can ask you to comment on each, where you are in terms of your spend, the SG&A guide sort of implies that we\u2019ve reached some peak level and we are going to taper off and then second with regard to the mix shift online, where are you in that journey. You said the customer is agnostic, are you financially agnostic?","Brian Cornell","Yeah. So let me start and I\u2019ll turn it over to Cathy and John. I think as we outlined today. We have made significant investments in last year, in our team, in new capabilities and new brands. You are going to see that stabilize as we go into 2018 and as Cathy mentioned in our outlook, we expect to see gross margin rates stabilize, if not slightly improve in 2018, offset by some of the investments we will make in SG&A.","So I think we have reached the point of general stability in our model. We are going to continue to invest. It\u2019s a period of now acceleration. But we have spent a lot of time over the last three years, testing and validating our investments, making sure the right thing for our guests, the right thing for our shareholders, they are going to be sustainable and they are also going to provide the right return on invested capital and I think you saw that today in our outlook.","So, again, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in 2018. It is a year of acceleration. But we are accelerating based on the validation that we saw in \u201818 and the confidence that we are going to continue to drive great returns.","Cathy Smith","The only thing I would add, I mean is, kind of longer-term that perspective of as our business model is evolving, I am using the stores at the center of that strategy, we do expect that you\u2019ll see continued really terrific ROIC or after-tax ROIC. And so kind of probably lower operating margins that we\u2019ve seen historically not inconsistent with where we are today, but really strong continued asset efficiency, which will drive the ROIC, so growth in ROIC.","Brian Cornell","And your question about digital and the mix between the two channels, as I said several times today, we really want to make Target America\u2019s easiest place to shop, allow our guests to interface with great stores and even better store experiences as we remodel, give them a number of options for fulfillment, whether it\u2019s order online and pick up in our store, now Drive Up to our lot and pop that trunk and we will put it right in there, use Shipt to provide same-day delivering in hours if not minutes and convenient service right to their home. So we have to be agnostic, let the guest decide.","But one of the great highlights from our fourth quarter was the fact that we saw really strong traffic and growth both in our stores and our digital channel, and we expect as we go into 2018 to continue to drive positive growth into our stores to drive positive comps in stores that\u2019s critically important and to continue to be a leader in digital growth. I think the investments we\u2019re making in Shipt, in Drive Up and other services positions Target uniquely as we move into this next era of retailing. Right over here.","Wayne Hood","Just to follow up on his question, looking at the spin rate in remodels maybe peaking by 2020 the wage investments, it\u2019s actually peaking then as well. Why wouldn\u2019t you expect operating margins to lift in 2020 given the run-off in D&A and the spent is actually over? And then I have a question about, John, if you talk a little bit about the execution -- a lot of I heard -- what we have seen so far today is absence some of the improved processes, but it didn\u2019t really address maybe the headwind in the store, it\u2019s the modular issue that the systems will get the right quantities, but the challenge is the modular are not really set in a way that allows that the flow very as nice as you would like see. So how do you address that the modular side is the store format begins to change over time?","Brian Cornell","John, let me start with the first part of the question. And Wayne you are absolutely right. As we get into the out years, we are going to see our remodel schedule begin to normalized, right now we are in a catch-up state and as we accelerate over the next three years, obviously, we will touch the vast majority of our stores. So in the out years we do expect that to normalize. But we have a lot of work to do in these next few years. It\u2019s all about making sure we execute our plan and touch and enhance the experience in as many stores as possible before we returned to a normal remodel schedule.","John Mulligan","I\u2019m sorry, Wayne, I didn\u2019t fully understand your second part of your question.","Wayne Hood","I probably didn\u2019t ask it right, but I will ask it again.","John Mulligan","Yeah.","Wayne Hood","So the challenge to me has always been on store replenishment side was the modulars really are not of the size that allows you to get a full case back on to the modular\u2026","Brian Cornell","Yeah.","Wayne Hood","\u2026and you can do all the backroom maneuvering that you want to do that gives you so far, but those modulars over time since we have to change to allow for better quantities, what you want to and then you take into account how the store is changing and what modulars may or may not present there in five years to 10 years now you maybe look at another remodel around based on the modular side?","John Mulligan","Yeah. I think this goes back to why we talk about flexibility in the supply chain to address that. I think when you look we are at today and you are right, it will evolve over the next 10 years, I -- who knows what will have in store then, maybe Mark does, but that will come later, 70% of that stuff doesn\u2019t sell more than one per store per week, so I don\u2019t need to flow case packs into that store for those items, you think about bike helmets, the likelihood of us selling more than one bike helmet in a week, this time a year in Minneapolis is very low.","We may sell one and probabilistically we will sell one sometime this month, but we won\u2019t sell more than that and so that\u2019s why we go back to flexibility. There\u2019s things that are going to have to go in there in a very high speed, high-capacity, to your point we need to make sure a case pack fits on the floor or case pack in half or three case packs in the case of Tide or eight case packs or 20 case packs, because we will move that in pallet loads.","But for the majority of what we sell much lower volumes that needs to come in in single units and so it\u2019s really about having that flexibility upstream to meet the demands of whatever it is we are doing in store and that\u2019s why we are headed down the path we are.","Brian Cornell","And to go on the side of the room. Oliver?","Matt Fassler","I am sorry, it\u2019s actually, hi, it\u2019s Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Cornell","Hi, Matt. You guys look exactly alike.","John Mulligan","From here.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot for your remarks today so far. I have got a question -- I\u2019ve got a question about the level and cadence of expense growth as you move through the year, the guidance that you gave for Q1 and then for the year as a whole would imply that the expense profile improves as we move through the year. As the wage growth piece seems like it will be persistent, are there expenses that fade as you go through the year, are there cost out opportunities that build or is there topline acceleration implied in the guidance? Thanks so much.","Cathy Smith","Yeah. It\u2019s a little bit of, I talked about all of the tailwinds and it is a little bit of all of those things. So we will see some leverage because of the continued comp sales increase. We will see some continued cost control as we move throughout the year that we have plan. So it\u2019s kind of the combination of the four different tailwinds and none of the headwinds.","Matt Fassler","And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, you also shared lots of topline drivers, you talked about remodels, the new brand Shipt, free two-day shipping for a large array of goods. Can you talk about how those layer into the revenue forecast over the course of the year?","Cathy Smith","Well, we gave first quarter guidance, I can start, John, I guess, we gave first quarter guidance, obviously, low single-digit and we gave full year guidance low single-digit, and those all contemplate, obviously, our continued brand rollouts, as well as all of our fulfillment expansion. So those are all included in that low single, just so happen is Q1 and full-year.","John Mulligan","Yeah. And much of the digital, absent the two-day which is effective today.","Cathy Smith","Yeah.","John Mulligan","The Shipt and Drive Up, those the two big ones that will expand nationally our goal. You will see a pretty linear ramp up through the end of Q3 and our goal is to have all of that done ready for Q4 to redone and that will all ramp up as we go along throughout the year.","Matt Fassler","Thank you so much.","Brian Cornell","We\u2019ll go back upfront.","John Zolidis","Brian we got one from the webcast participants, we got somebody that said they applaud us for the CapEx that we have projects that are high returning, wondered after this wave of remodels is over, the 1000 over the next three years, what a more normalized level of CapEx might look like in the longer term?","Brian Cornell","I think most of you know we are not going to provide long-term guidance. We are not going to provide long-term CapEx guidance. But we are going to continue to look at different projects that add value and provide great returns for our shareholders. We will be looking in the future to think about how we continue to provide a great physical and digital experience for our guests and make the right investments that continue to add value for our shareholders. So we don\u2019t have a long-term guidance that we are going to provide today for CapEx John but we are going to continue to take the same disciplined and surgical approach to CapEx that you have seen over the last few years.","John Zolidis","Right.","Brian Cornell","Why don\u2019t we go upfront, I will give all the chance since I jump over on the floor.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for the presentation.","Brian Cornell","Good morning.","Oliver Chen","The digitization of the supply chain is likely key to unlocking the asset turns. What do you think about that with respect to algorithms, as well as your relationships with vendors and as you think about robots and making sure that\u2019s on track?","Brian Cornell","John?","John Mulligan","Yeah. So all things we are working on, Oliver, you heard me talk about, we spent the last 12 months testing automation and I think five different facilities, various different forms of automation, bringing them together in different combinations in the Perth Amboy facility on the Northeast, we are starting implementation of 1 Vio of that. We are implementing something different here in DC located in Fridley, so that\u2019s a piece of it. We have a large team working on supply chain analytics, primarily located, but not exclusively located out in the Bay area, working with Mike\u2019s team to provide the technology and the analytics in combination, and again if you look at Perth Amboy, Mike\u2019s team built an entirely new warehouse management system and then there is the analytics attached to it to move how much inventory. So we are moving down the path on all of those together. It is going to take all of those to deliver what we want from a supply chain perspective.","Brian Cornell","And Oliver, we try to showcase obviously a lot of the initiatives today, give you a chance to interact with the team, see the work that we are doing today. What underpin so much of that is the work we\u2019re doing from a data and analytical standpoint. So our team in Sunnyvale that\u2019s supporting Mark and his team to make better assortment choices, better pricing and promotional choices. Mike\u2019s team of engineers that\u2019s driving so much of the work we are doing as we reinvent how we run our stores, how we fuel our supply chain.","So the commitment and the investments we are making in our team go well beyond what you\u2019ve seen today and a lot of it is to make sure we have cutting-edge data analytics. We have got great engineer and computer scientists that are helping Mike and Mark and Rick make better decisions from a merchandising standpoint, a digital standpoint and a marketing standpoint, and that\u2019s certainly to fuel our business as we go forward for years to come.","Oliver Chen","Last question Is about value, what are your thoughts about value in terms of making sure you communicate a clear value and as we model comp store sales, should we continue to see your check size versus traffic, how do you think that will evolve and stocking versus fill up?","Brian Cornell","Yeah. I think one of the great highlight this year that we really didn\u2019t cover is the work that was done between Mark\u2019s merchandising team and Rick Gomez\u2019s marketing team. To make sure that as we made these investments to be price right daily. We communicated that to our guests. Both in-store from a personalize standpoint and throughout the year in our marketing and advertising campaign, and I think it was the combination of all that work that yielded the benefits that Cathy talked about today, that significant makes the $4 billion of sales from promo to every day.","So as we go forward we will continue to remind our guests that we offer great value that we are price right daily on thousands of items across the store and I think one of the great turning points for our business this year was the balance that we brought back to advertising Target style, but also letting our guests know every single week that we were price right daily and there was great value within the store. And I think that\u2019s driving traffic. I think that played a significant part in the traffic increases we saw in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s driving basket.","And beyond some of the numbers that we\u2019ve shared it driving an acceleration in units in those important personal and essential categories. So that commitment to value and being price right daily, we think is critically important to driving traffic, to leveraging our multi-category portfolio, and making sure people are shopping is not only for the great style brands that our teams are bringing to market, but those household essentials that bring cars in our parking lot and click store site every single week. So that commitment to value is something that you\u2019ll see throughout \u201818 and for years to come. Why don\u2019t we go to the back of the room and I will let you pick a hand because unfortunately from here we can\u2019t see. So if you can identify yourself we would really appreciate it.","Bob Drbul","Hi. It\u2019s Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities.","Brian Cornell","Hi, Bob.","Bob Drbul","Brian and the two question I have, I guess, the first one is, as you look at the full year expectation for gross margin coming off of this holiday season. Can you just reiterate what you see from a gross margin and competitive perspective that gives you the confidence a flattish or up slightly gross margin?","And the second question is, I think, on the free two-day shipping program, will that be fulfilled out of the stores or is that going to be fulfillment center type, can you just elaborate on that expectation going forward?","Brian Cornell","So when I start from a margin standpoint and as we\u2019ve talked about throughout the last few quarters. Our team has made significant progress as we have shifted our business from promo to every-day, the byproduct of that commitment to be price right daily. That\u2019s going to continue as we go forward.","As you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of days we will continue to introduce great new owned brands in those signature categories that as we all know our higher margin and provide a great return both in-store but also to our digital business. So we will continue to see the benefits of the analytics, the science that we are placing behind, our pricing and promo strategy, the shift from promotional sales to more regular priced business, the benefits as we bring new excitement into our stores with great innovation. That\u2019s going to continue to stabilize and improve our margins over time and it\u2019s a great point of differentiation.","So whether it\u2019s Opal House or Umbro or some of the things you saw this morning, many of the things that we will talk about over the balance of the year those higher margin home and apparel items, those great owned brands that you can only find at Target benefit not only our store margins but also our digital margins and we will continue to drive efficiency over time. John, you want to talk about fulfillment?","John Mulligan","Yeah. I think you will see -- next year this meeting you will see that our penetration of units delivered from stores will grow relative to 2017 and relative to two-day, absolutely, we would expect the majority of that to be delivered from store. We know that\u2019s the fastest place that can be delivered from.","Brian Cornell","John, can we go to the webcast.","John Hulbert","Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We\u2019ve got a variety of questions about Shipt, so I\u2019ll just give you all of them. One being are we getting new guests coming in because of Shipt yet. One the decision are to maintain the marketplace in other words share the marketplace with other retailers on the Shipt platform. And then, finally, the decision of why to require them versus to just become a partner on their platform?","Brian Cornell","John, do you want to lead this one off?","John Mulligan","Sure. I think, maybe I\u2019ll start with just, what are we trying to do with Shipt and then hopefully address some of those questions. We have three priorities for Shipt that we have been focused on since we close the acquisition. One is, scale Target nationally on the Shipt app and Shipt.com and we are well down that path. We are in 455 stores. We are adding markets every single week.","The second was bring Shipt to Target.com, Mike and his team are working hard on that to provide that option for guests who come to us directly through Target.com we will provide same-day delivery service for our entire assortment.","And then third was expand the marketplace and I guess to get out a little bit of this. We think the value here is about bringing all those retailers together. That\u2019s the value of the membership. We know consumers have different reasons they go to different retailers, often they come to Target. We really like that. Sometimes they go other places. But bringing all of those retailers together on one marketplace is incredibly powerful to bring consumers into the Shipt app and so we had great conversations with other retailers. We already have great partners and HEB and Publix and Meyer, Cosco, all on the app and we will continue to grow that. So we are very interested in continuing to grow the marketplace.","Brian Cornell","And to the other question, Cathy, John and I all spent quite a bit of time looking at other same-day delivery options and we invested a lot of time getting to know the Shipt organization. We were attracted to Shipt and decided to take an ownership position because of that personal connection we saw with their member.","And as we spent time and went to Birmingham, work with some of their shoppers, saw the caliber of people that were shopping for Shipt, these moms were shopping for moms, the approach they took to really building a relationship, we felt it was so important to own that last mile touch and that human interaction that we think really differentiates Target from anyone else in that space. So we certainly had options to partner with other last mile delivery companies.","But we thought Shipt had a very different approach. It wasn\u2019t just the transaction. It was building a relationship and we thought owning that human touch was very consistent with what we think is our greatest asset and that\u2019s our people that make such a difference as we talked to guests and they describe why they shop at Target, as I said early today, most of the answer is pretty simple, is because of our team. Okay.","Peter Benedict","Thanks. Peter Benedict at Baird. Two questions, first, the cost to upgrade these fulfillment centers modernization, John, you talked about, can you give a sense of maybe how much that is going to contribute to the capital spend over the next few years, what\u2019s the cadence, how many do you need to do and when do we get to the end point there?","And the second point question would be on inventory growth. How should we think about that as you kind of clean up the backrooms, you put the fall product over the supply chain, how should we think about into our growth maybe versus sales something?","John Mulligan","Yeah. I think first on the capital -- Cathy has provided the capital guidance, it\u2019s all within our capital guidance, everything we have talked about we have planned for, if that changes, I am sure, Cathy will come back and let you know that changes.","And I think pace we will know more about that actually near the end of this year than I do right now. We are very focused on getting the Perth Amboy facility up and operating and -- because that\u2019s kind of the end state. This is what great will look like.","Simultaneous with that, like I said, we are testing how we can start to evolve the broader network into that step by step by step and what we are doing this year would be the first step and we hope to have a decision about perhaps getting to eight of those realistically probably very early next year and then expand from there.","Meanwhile while we are doing that, go back into the local distribution center and say, okay, what\u2019s the next step we would bring to that in order to move it down the path. So that\u2019s kind of the sequence we are thinking about year-over-year. This won\u2019t happen over the next 18 months, because it can\u2019t. This is a conversation we have internally a lot.","If we could like shutdown for nine months and not a deliver any product to stores we can get this done very quickly, but we don\u2019t have that ability. We need to keep producing product for the store. We are shipping product to the store, so it will be a gradual evolution over time, the investments will follow that gradual evolution.","Cathy Smith","Can I answer the inventory question real quick for you? A longer term as we talked many times, Peter. We do see that inventory loads as we move product exactly where we need it, when we need it, we will continue to come down. Obviously, we want to make sure we have a great guest experience and we are in stock and so we are going to balance that as we are evolving the supply chain so through this transition and then obviously to support all of the wonderful new brands and products we are bringing in.","Peter Benedict","Got it.","Brian Cornell","So just to build on that, it is going to take time and as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple years with the approach we have taken to a number of initiatives, we are going to test, learn, iterate and then move forward, and this is same model we took to own brands, starting with Cat & Jack, learning from that success and now we\u2019re building out the portfolio.","The same approach we took to remodels. We started with 25 stores in LA. We continue to learn and listen and iterate and once we saw the right response from the guests and the right return on invested capital we move more quickly.","We are doing the same thing from a DC standpoint. We are constantly learning and updating our approach and we think we\u2019ve got a model that we can expand but we are going to do that very, very carefully and make sure that we have a system that can be scaled.","And when we get there to Wayne\u2019s question, we will see better units of measure flow into the stores, which will naturally improve inventory levels and working capital. But this is one that\u2019s going to take time. To John\u2019s point we are not shutting down our system for nine months. It\u2019s going to be a multiyear journey, but we are going to make sure that we do it right and we get the right returns and continue to provide the right experience for our guests. We have got a question upfront here.","Greg Melich","Hi. It\u2019s Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson.","Brian Cornell","Hi, Greg.","Greg Melich","So I had a follow up for Cathy and Brian another question. Cathy the $3.5 billion CapEx, that is I think about $500 million and what we are thinking before. Should we think about that, I know you are not giving long-term guidance, but does that more of a pull-forward of things that you had or more given what you see just this more stuff you want to lean into this year? And then, Brian, I had a follow-up?","Cathy Smith","Yeah. So consistent with our strategy, Brian, had laid out, we intend to remodel, we are seeing a great returns, 2% to 4% lift. We make sure we have great returns on invested capital with those and as we\u2019ve seen the remodels perform we are going to continue to get towards that 1000 stores that Brian talked about, but and by the time we get there is much of our fleet will be much younger in age, obviously, some of the heavier needs are earlier on, which is why the capital is little higher. But I would expect we\u2019ve done the $2.5 billion, $3.5 billion this year, obviously, we\u2019re not slowing down, we are seeing great returning and we are seeing a great response from our guests. So we are not giving long-term guidance, but you can expect that we will continue down those stores.","Greg Melich","Okay. And then, Brian, you talk a lot about acceleration, right. What happened last year it\u2019s now time to really accelerate it? Could you talk a little bit more about the brand acceleration? I mean, it seems like with 12 brands and 12 months and is that a new run rate, I mean, can the organization really be expected to come up with that many new great brands and ideas every year or is there certain amount that you -- or could have become 18 in a year or is there certain amount of product that you sort of limited on that ultimately where we only want to change over a quarter of the SKUs or something like that?","Brian Cornell","So, Greg, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be the long-term run rate. But certainly as the Mark and his team had look at the portfolio, we\u2019ve seen opportunities through replacing the existing brands that\u2019s been our portfolio, fill new white spaces and over the balance of 2018 we will continue to bring newness and innovation own brands and then we will continue to listen to the guests, understand category trends and bring great newness and innovation, whether it\u2019s with a new own brand or some of the great partnerships we will continue to bring forward on a limited time basis like we announced earlier today.","So I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be the run rate right for Mark and his team, but we see significant opportunities to continue to strengthen our owned brand portfolio in 2018 and we will look for further opportunities in the years to come. Let\u2019s go to all the way at the back of the room.","Bill Dreher","Yeah. Thank you. Bill Dreher here from Susquehanna Financial Group. I have a regarding the renovations and remodels, how do you prioritize the renovations and remodels, are you working with the stores of the greatest opportunity, the older stores or how do you work on that? And then how do you -- how much of the new store remodel program can be brought in, not 100% of all the new module to be brought in, should we be expecting a similar 78% of modulars brought in and how does that rollout?","Brian Cornell","John, do you want to talk about the remodel strategy?","John Mulligan","Yeah. So it\u2019s a little bit of everything you said actually when we are choosing the stores, we have model that helps us generate age, condition, when is the last time, part of that comes into it is how hard is this store shop, how high volume is it, what is the average basket, so do they get shopped really hard day in and day out.","And to your point, where can we have the biggest impact, where can we go and say, look these 10 stores or dozen stores we know that they are in need of it and we will have a big impact. So we go through a process. The team recommends those.","They have conversations with the senior store leaders as well to get their local viewpoint about what\u2019s going on in that marketplace, as somebody opened up six grocery stores around us or whatever it is, and say, hey, this is one where we could really use the help competitively. So there\u2019s multiple pieces we come together with the team distills that down and then we come to a consensus about this is the list we are going to go after for this year.","As you can imagine when you\u2019re do on the 100, that\u2019s a lot more difficult when you\u2019re doing -- then when you\u2019re doing 325, the list gets a lot more easy and a lot less contentious. So it\u2019s a great process. The team is already working on 2019 and actually thinking about 2020 us so that all happens much further in advance.","To your question about what gets put into the remodel? Our goal is always to put in as many elements as we can in any individual store. The calibration though is we want to make sure that store can afford to have that much investment. And so lower volume stores get less and the great thing is and I\u2019ve seen this happen multiple times when we say, hey, here is we are going to draw the line on lower volume, Brian, challenges the team, go figure out a way to get these two more elements into that store. They go back. They value engineered. They find ways to do it more efficiently. Certainly as we do more scale that brings efficiency to it and so we found ways to move some of the elements we really like even into those low volume remodels.","Brian Cornell","So I have got a note say it\u2019s time to wrap up this session. But before we close out, I do want to thank you for joining us in Minneapolis this week. We spent a lot of time debating where to hold this meeting and really thought based on stage of our journey it was the right time to have you here, so you could see our new renovated downtown store, spend quality time with our leadership team.","This morning we wanted to give you a sense for all of these initiatives we are working on and how there are going to help us create the target of the future, give you a glimpse into some of the things we are doing from a technology standpoint, that\u2019s going to make it easier for our guests to shop at Target and easy for our team to support that guest. And I hope today we are able to give you a sense for our excitement for 2018.","2017 was a year of significant progress for this team. 2018 is all about acceleration. Taking all the learning that we\u2019ve gathered over the last couple of years and really stepping on the accelerator and I think we\u2019re on our way to creating long-term value for our shareholders, but most importantly, continuing to differentiate our brand and ensuring Target is one of the long-term retail winners as we move forward.","So, thanks again for joining us, travel safely and we look forward to seeing you again later in the year. So thank you."],"20385":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call May 21, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","","John Mulligan \u2013 Interim President and Chief Executive Officer","Kathryn Tesija \u2013 Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain officer","John Hulbert \u2013 Senior Director Investor, Communications","Analysts","","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Robert Drbul \u2013 Nomura Securities","Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group","Matthew Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Sean Naughton \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 21, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Senior Director, Investor Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning and thank you for joining us on our 2014 first quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are John Mulligan, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain officer. ","This morning, John will provide a high level summary of our first quarter results and strategic priorities for the remainder of the year, then Kathee will discuss results in the U.S and Canada, guest insights, and plans for the second quarter and beyond. And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John for a review of the quarter and our priorities going forward. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, John. First off today, I want to thank the Target team for their energy and commitment. The first quarter was unusually challenging as we worked hard to help our guests recover from the data breach. Because of the team\u2019s efforts, traffic and sales trends have improved substantially and we\u2019re in a much better position today than we were just three months ago. ","Also, before I turn to the first quarter operating results, I want to briefly discuss the board\u2019s recent announcement of Gregg Steinhafel\u2019s departure and the initiation of a comprehensive internal and external search for a permanent replacement. I want to thank Greg for all his contributions to Target over his 35 year career and I\u2019m humbled to follow him into this role, even on an interim basis. With the full support of the board, Kathee and I, along with the rest of the leadership team, have made it clear to the entire Target team that we are not going to wait for a permanent CEO to improve our operations and performance. We are already taking important steps, including management changes announced yesterday to move the organization forward. ","This morning we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.70, above the midpoint of our guidance. This is the result of generally in line performance in both the U.S and Canada, combined with a better than expected tax rate driven by a variety of small matters, none of which was individually significant. Our U.S segment comparable sales decline of 0.3% was near the upper end of our guidance and reflects meaningful improvement from trends we were experiencing shortly after the breach.","When we survey consumers, we increasingly hear that they have put the breach behind them and they\u2019re resuming their Target shopping habits. We\u2019re pleased with this progress and continuing to take steps that reinforce our commitment to earn back the trust of our guests. We recently announced that we\u2019ve hired Bob DeRodes as our new Chief Information Officer and I\u2019m confident that Bob is the right person to lead our technology transformation and data security remediation efforts. That same day, we also announced the important decision to move all of our REDcards under MasterCard\u2019s industry leading chip-and-PIN technology. This decision, along with our accelerated rollout of chip-enabled card readers to all of our stores by this September, are among many crucial steps we\u2019re taking to restore confidence among our guests, that it\u2019s safe to shop at Target.","The first quarter Canadian segment results were also largely in line with our expectations. Sales were just below the expected range, driven by softness early in the quarter. While losses were meaningfully in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re still far from where we need to be. We continued to roll out enhanced tools and technology. We\u2019ve increased the intensity of our volume messaging, and we\u2019ve made several important changes to the Target Canada leadership team during the quarter. As a result, we\u2019re beginning to see improved guest satisfaction measures regarding in-stocks and price perception. While these early signs of progress indicate that we're moving in the right direction, we're committed to moving faster.","As we look ahead to the second quarter and beyond, the Board and our team are aligned on three priorities. The first is growing traffic and sales in our U.S. segment. While the environment is challenging, we can do better. We need to improve on something we've historically done well, delivering unique products and services at great prices. As a result, we're working quickly to drive more newness in our merchandising and presentation, helping to keep Target top in mind with guests by continually reminding them why they fell in love with Target in the first place.","Second, we must improve our Canadian segment performance. Canada is a great market and Target is a great retailer, but so far, we have not lived up to our potential or our expectations. Improving operations is key, but we need to think broadly about all aspects of our business and whether other changes are needed. We've made changes to the Target Canada leadership team so they could take a hard look at our current performance and apply fresh thinking about how to improve.","Finally, we need to accelerate our digital transformation and become a leading Omni-channel retailer. To do this, we'll move more quickly to become more flexible in how we serve our guests, eliminating barriers that prevent them from shopping with us, where and when they want. This includes delivering products and services more flexibly in our stores or anywhere else the guest wants to receive them. ","Our common theme across all of these priorities is a continued focus on our guests, not just the ones we currently have, but the potential guests who aren't shopping with us today. We need to listen intently to all of them, how they're feeling, what they want and how well we're serving them. With that knowledge, we need to make decisions based on what will inspire them, deepening their love for Target by making their lives easier and apply all of our energy to make that happen.","Finally, we know we can't accomplish any of this unless we unleash the talents of our great team. So we are focused on prioritizing and aligning our efforts to provide greater clarity and removing roadblocks that have been slowing our team down. We will empower them to take smart risks and hold ourselves accountable for learning quickly from the results. We have been on this journey for some time, but the Board believes and we agree that we can accelerate our progress. Given the recent announcements of leadership changes, many of you asked what is going to change. While that is certainly important, I want to make sure we discuss what is and is not going to change. ","What clearly will change includes our emphasis on speed throughout the organization, our commitment to more rapid improvement in Canada, our focus on digital and becoming a leading Omni-channel retailer, and the level of investment in newness and innovation and what we offer to our guests. While we work for those goals, we'll continue to develop smaller, more flexible store formats to allow us to serve guests in markets that can accommodate our larger store layouts. We'll continue our expense optimization efforts. Our goal is not to cut our way to prosperity, but to free up resources we can leverage and support a faster growth.","Finally, our point of view on capital deployment remains the same. This has always been a Board level discussion and we continue to be aligned with them on the following priorities; invest everything appropriate in our core business on projects that will support Target's growth and generate superior returns; support the dividend and build on our record of more than 40 years of annual dividend increases. And beyond those first two uses, return cash through share repurchase when we have room within our middle A credit ratings. The Board has made it clear that they agree with these priorities and that our leadership team has their full support. Our mission from the Board is clear; provide focus, remove roadblocks and unleash the team to move faster. As Jeff Jones, our Chief Marketing Officer likes to say, interim will not mean idle. We're committed to making real changes now, accelerating our transformation during this transition period, while the Board conducts its search for a permanent CEO.","Now, Kathee will provide more details on first quarter results, second quarter plans and key priorities for the remainder of the year. Kathee?","Kathryn Tesija","Thanks John. As John mentioned, we entered the first quarter during a tumultuous time for our U.S. business as traffic and sales trends were still recovering from the meaningful declines we saw following the data breach. Our plan was clear; make Target irresistible to our guests with exciting content and compelling deals. Our efforts produced mixed results for the quarter, reflecting unfavorable weather in February, followed by the strongest results in March and weaker than expected Easter sales in April. In total, first quarter performance was meaningfully better than the fourth quarter as comparable sales improved by more than 2 percentage points and comparable transactions improved even more.","In our U.S. business, first quarter comparable sales were strongest in hard lines, driven by a mid-single-digit increase in electronics, which continues to benefit from strong trends in mobile. Comparable sales in our less discretionary food, health and beauty categories were slightly positive, while home and apparels saw small comp declines, with our digital channels' first quarter sales were strongest in health and beauty and home.","U.S. segment comparable traffic was down a little more than 2%, which was nearly offset by a healthy 2.1% increase in basket size. Within the average basket, we saw an increase in both units and average retail, reflecting our continued success in attracting guests to add more items to their carts and trade up to higher price points. First quarter digital visits were up more than 20% from a year ago, which according to comScore was the fastest growth among a group consisting of Target and seven of our largest online competitors. The share of digital visits from a mobile phone or a tablet continues to grow and in the first quarter, almost two-thirds of our digital traffic was on one of these devices. ","Conversion rates on both our conventional and mobile sites improved in the first quarter driving an increase in overall conversion despite the mixed headwind created by the shift into mobile. The combined benefit of traffic and conversion improvements drove first quarter digital channel sales up more than 30% from last year. Our U.S. segment first quarter gross margin rate was down more than 1 percentage point from last year as our team focused on providing irresistible deals for our guests. Based on the success of fourth quarter promotions prior to the data breach, we had already planned for a steady drumbeat of compelling offers this spring. ","However, following the data breach, we decided to ramp up the intensity of these promotions even more to motivate guests to reestablish their shopping routine at Target. For example, in late February, we offered Five 12 packs of Coke products for $10, our lowest price in more than a decade. In early March, we featured a spring cleaning incentive, offering $20 in savings when guests spent $50 on cleaning products. Also in March, our shoe sale featured a buy one, get one half off promotion. And in April, we ran a Cartwheel offer to save an extra 10% on 42 of our biggest deals from the front and back cover of our weekly ad.","In the U.S., to help reinforce Target as the destination to shop for anything, anytime, anywhere, we've launched the yearlong Target Run marketing campaign, featuring national and owned brand items across categories like food, personal care, baby, paper and pets. This Run campaign will change with seasons and other timely events and is intended to make Target our guest destination for those fill-in trips they might consider making at a drug or a grocery store. While there is certainly more work to do, we are pleased that so many of our guests have responded to our promotions and moved beyond the data breach to resume their Target shopping habits.","In fact, recent survey research show that the vast majority of our lapsed guests, those who had changed their shopping habits and not visited Target since the data breach, had come back for at least one visit by the end of the first quarter. And while irresistible first quarter promotions were key to reinforcing the pay less side of our brand promise, we were equally focused on initiatives that offer newness and deliver on the expect more side of that promise. We led off the quarter with the February launch of Peter Pilotto for Target. Guests in the U.S. and Canada and worldwide through our collaboration with Net-A-Porter responded enthusiastically to Target's exclusive collection of women's apparel, accessories and swimwear. ","Home is already one of our fastest growing online categories, and while we feel good about our opening price point offerings, we believe we can more fully serve guests at higher price points. To begin addressing this opportunity, in March, Target.com launched over 2,000 new furniture items from Safavieh, a brand that online guests recognize for having great style at an accessible price. Target's assortment features stylish items and furniture, rug, lighting and soft home, including many Target exclusives. Safavieh anchored the spring home sale during April week three and was showcased on the Target.com homepage and we're happy with early sales results.","Guests are increasingly looking for natural, organic and sustainable products that are better for them and their families. So in March, we launched Made to Matter hand-picked by Target, a first of its kind collection that brings together 16 leading natural organic and sustainable brands to showcase new products and make them more accessible for our guests. The Made to Matter products span six categories featured both in our regular locations and in specialized displays, while select products are available at Target.com and our mobile app. We'll be adding new items to this collection throughout the year and enticing guests to try these products with offers on Cartwheel.","Also in the first quarter, we were blown away by the response to the release of Disney's Frozen on DVD and Blu-ray, and we saw amazing results across music, movies and books. In fact, when Frozen was released on DVD and Blu-ray in March, it became the most successful first day release for any movie in Target history. And in the short time since, the movie has become Target's biggest movie ever. In the first month alone, we sold more units than we sold in the first year of Finding Nemo, which previously held the record for our biggest release. In children's books, Frozen continues to be the number one license in the first quarter and we sold hundreds of thousands of units since its set last September. And finally in music, the Frozen soundtrack also held the number one spot throughout the first quarter, selling more units in April than all of our other releases combined. ","Cartwheels just celebrated its one-year anniversary, having far outpaced our expectations. Cartwheel has attracted more than 7 million users in that time, most of whom continue to use Cartwheel after their first redemption. Cumulative Cartwheel savings have grown past $70 million and our active Cartwheel users have on average increased their trips and spend at Target by nearly 30%, driving hundreds of millions of incremental sales from these households. And in the first quarter, we saw a 33% increase in new Cartwheel users when we integrated the app into our weekly ad for the first time. ","We continue to see encouraging results from our recent rollout of in-store pickup of digital orders. These orders make up about 10% of our digital transactions and when guests pick up their items, more than 20% of the time, they take the opportunity to shop the store and spend much more than our average basket. In the first quarter, we expanded the number of SKUs eligible for in-store pickup to more than 60,000, including some shelf stable grocery items.","Following a successful shift from store tests with Minneapolis team members, we are planning to launch a guest facing $10 rush delivery pilot in June in the Minneapolis, Boston and Miami markets, offering guests the ability to order as late as 1.30 p.m. in the afternoon and receive a delivery of qualifying items between 6.00 p.m. and 9.00 p.m. the same day. Later in the year, we plan to rollout standard shipping from 136 stores in 38 markets across the country. By leveraging the store network as fulfillment centers, we can offer faster, standard shipping, typically one to two days and provide access to store only items not previously available from Target.com. We will continue to monitor results to determine further rollout plans. ","As John mentioned in Canada, we continue to enhance our operations in the first quarter and our in-stocks have started to show meaningful improvement. At the same time, we ramped up our promotional intensity to show our guests the depth, breadth and pricing of our assortment in frequency categories, and our guests have taken notice. In a recent survey of Canadian guests, we saw double-digit improvements in favorable responses to questions regarding our in-stocks, whether we provide a good value, our everyday pricing and the quality of our deals. First quarter Canadian segment sales were slightly below plan, driven by softness in February and March and stronger performance in April. Our gross margin rate of 18.7% improved dramatically from the fourth quarter, but it remains far below where it needs to be as we continue to clear excess inventory on long lead receipts.","While our progress in Canada is encouraging, we have an opportunity to move much faster. Yesterday, we announced that Mark Schindele has assumed the role of President, Target Canada, reporting to me. Mark is a strong leader who has spent the last 15 years at Target. He has broad experience in merchandising and operations and he will bring a fresh perspective to the Target Canada team. Mark will join Janna Adair Potts who recently took on responsibility for our Canadian Stores and Distribution; John Butcher, our new leader of Merchandising in Canada; Livia Zufferli, who leads Target Canada, Marketing; Tiffany Monroe, who leads Target Canada Human Resources; and Mark Wong, Target Canada's General Counsel; as they elevate all aspects of our Canadian business and implement changes to improve our performance. Yesterday, we also announced that Target will be naming a Non-Executive Chair in Canada, someone with deep knowledge and expertise in the Canadian market who will collaborate with the President of Target Canada to ensure our strategies and tactics align with the Canadian marketplace.","Here in the U.S, as we survey our guests and monitor consumer sentiment, we continue to see what we have seen for some time; signs of optimism, combined with reasons for continued caution. On the positive side, recent stock market highs, slow but persistent job growth and rising home values, are driving improved consumer sentiment metrics. However, lack of income growth among more moderate income families and persistent lack of household formation are hampering the pace of recovery. Given our exposure to lower and middle income households, the environment remains challenging overall and we face the additional challenge of addressing the lingering effects of the data breach.","Consumer survey data shows that we've made substantial progress on measures of Target's favorability and integrity in the U.S. and they are approaching levels we were seeing prior to the data breach. However, while trust measures have improved as well, we need to make more progress to restore them to pre-breach levels. That's why we're focused on delivering on our commitment to accelerate the rollout of chip-and-PIN on our cards and in our stores, along with many other visible steps we are taking to increase the security of the entire U.S. card payment system.","As John mentioned, for the remainder of the year, we're working quickly to enhance the flow of newness and innovation in our products, presentation and promotions. For the second quarter, we've lined up compelling deals, services and products designed to accelerate trips to Target across all of our channels. We are further enhancing our mobile platform to improve the experience and drive continued increases in conversion. Advancements underway are planned for this year, include more sorting options for guests shopping on a mobile device, a save for later option in the mobile basket, better visibility to our in-store pickup capabilities, streamline mobile checkout and dynamic customized landing pages.","We're also growing services like Target Subscriptions that make life easier for our guests. With very little marketing, the pilot of our subscriptions program quickly grew to account for more than 15% of Target.com sales on eligible items. As a result, we recently enhanced the program by expanding eligible items nearly 10-fold and offering a 5% discount on all subscription orders, helping our guests save even more time and money. We're continuing to integrate last year's acquisitions into Target's digital and store experiences. At DermStore, we're testing integration into our weekly digital ad and we'll begin selling DermStore gift cards in all stores in July. ","At CHEFS and Cooking.com, we're working to integrate their site content into our overall digital experience, continuing to expand the CHEFS assortment on Target.com and promoting both digital brands through inserts in millions of Target.com orders for cooking and kitchen items. Beyond acquisitions, we're excited about our investment in startup company Cosmic Cart, which offers a universal shopping cart for publishing websites and blogs. Their technology allows retailers to make sales directly from Cosmic Cart affiliate sites and allows shoppers to easily buy items while browsing online content. Beyond our investment, Target incubated the Cosmic Cart team at our Minneapolis headquarters for three months. During that time, the team built a white label product for Target to use on our own online and social channels. This product allows shoppers to purchase a Target product they see on a specific channel like the Instagram page of Target Style without having to leave to checkout on Target.com. We look forward to seeing how our guests respond to Cosmic Cart as we continue to test new ways to use their technology. ","Our wedding and baby registries have always been a smart way to shop for guests, but in U.S. stores this summer, they'll get even smarter with new web enabled, iPod based scanners that give guests a much more user friendly experience.","In apparel, earlier this month, we launched a new exclusive Mossimo Supply Company apparel collection in partnership with San Francisco based artist and avid surfer, Jeff Canham. This collection of classic surf inspired apparel includes tees, tanks, sport shorts, flip flops and beach towels.","Also this month, we launched the new Archer Farms Mix & Match Meals program in all of our SuperTarget and PFresh locations, more than 1,500 stores in all. With this program, guests can create a custom design meal for their family of four that's ready in 10 to 15 minutes and costs less than $18. These meals are comprised of unique sauces, fresh, cut and pre-washed vegetables, fully cooked pastas and starches and all natural pre-cooked meats. And of course, we're investing in service, in-store service and layout enhancements that will continue to differentiate the Target experience.","In baby, we've heard from guests that they love shopping our stores, but want help in making the smartest choices. Our enhanced baby experience provides just that with dedicated service, enhanced technology, expert information from BabyCenter and an easier to shop layout that allows guests to try out items like strollers. We expanded the test of this layout to nearly 30 stores this spring on our way to more than 200 locations this summer.","Like baby, the beauty category can be overwhelming and we want to inspire, educate and engage our guests. Our Beauty Concierge program, currently in more than 400 stores, offers guests the opportunity to interact with brand agnostic, non-commission-based advisors who help them feel confident in their purchases, driving sales through increased trips and bigger baskets.","This spring, we executed the largest physical update to the skincare and cosmetic aisles since 2001. The new environment includes brighter, more inviting LED lighting, large backlit signage, highlighting product attributes and ingredients to help informed decisions and shelving that allows for brand customization and cleaner presentations.","In entertainment and electronics, we're testing a new layout that invites guests to discover products and make more informed purchase decisions. Examples include discovery tables to display featured items and allow guests to interact and play with products as well as the integration of all children's books, movies and video game products in convenient locations. In addition to physical changes, this test incorporates enhanced team member training on product features and functionality. This redesigned experience is currently being tested in 17 stores and will determine future plans based on guests feedback.","Based on our experience in Canada and our CityTarget stores, we are testing enhanced displays including mannequins, which elevate the environment and help our guests save time by providing navigational cues throughout the area. Based on positive results from a limited test this spring, we plan to roll out enhanced apparel displays to 50 additional stores this summer and several hundred more stores this fall. We're in early stages of a test of a new toy floor pad that offers more hands-on experiences where families can explore and interact with products. The reinvention offers fun, interactive experiences, including larger than life toys and features streamlined shelving to improve sightlines for the guest. Based on results of this small test, we expect to rollout this layout to a number of additional stores this fall. ","In Canada, we're introducing a new format for the Flyer, their version of our weekly circular with a radical, new design based on feedback from our Canadian guests. The new format features a clean design, bolder price points and more products across all categories. We will use a consistent format each week that separates needs from wants, making it clear to our guests that we offer great deals on both. Specifically, we're adding an eight to 12 page wrap filled with frequency items so that the actual flyer has more room for discretionary categories like apparel and accessories, kids, seasonal and home; the categories, Canadian guests most associate with Target. And to further drive awareness and consideration of Target's frequency categories, Target Canada launched an integrated essentials marketing campaign highlighting products such as laundry detergent, diapers, grocery, multivitamins and more. The check it off your list for less campaign, which includes radio, TV, digital and the flyer launched on March 14th and is planned to run for 18 weeks.","While we've made considerable progress in the first quarter, the entire leadership team is working to achieve faster growth in the U.S, dramatically improve Canadian segment performance and accelerate Target's digital transformation. To accomplish this goal, we're going to leverage the fantastic assets we already have, a world class brand, a strong network of newly built or remodeled stores across the U.S. and Canada, strong partnerships with leading national brands, combined with a set of powerful, owned and exclusive brands, which benefit from our design and sourcing capabilities and most importantly, a motivated and talented team that's eager to win in the marketplace. ","Beyond the changes to the Canada team, yesterday we also announced changes to my team in the U.S, which will better leverage functional expertise to speed up innovation, drive newness and accelerate our digital transformation. With these changes, the team will be more agile, better positioned to deliver increased traffic and sales in the U.S. on our way to becoming a leading Omni-channel retailer. These leadership changes are among several we've made to focus our priorities and remove roadblocks that might slow down our teams. With these changes in place, we believe we can move faster and a team has enthusiastically embraced the challenge.","Now, I'll turn it back over to John who will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our second quarter and full year outlook. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks Kathee. As Kathee mentioned, our first quarter results were markedly better than our fourth quarter performance, specifically compared with the trends we were seeing late in the fourth quarter following the announcement of the data beach. In the U.S. segment, our comparable sales decline of 0.3% was near the high end of our guidance and flat to down 2%. Comparable traffic declined 2.3%, dramatically better than our late fourth quarter trends, but well below where we should perform over time. Consistent with broader trends in the U.S. market traffic, traffic in our stores has been declining, while transactions in our digital channels have been growing rapidly, particularly in mobile. ","However, given the relative size of these two channels at Target today, the mix effect of these opposing trends is driving a decline in overall transactions. The key to reversing this decline is clear; accelerate our digital capabilities and leverage assets across both our physical and digital channels to lead guests to choose us more often than they are today. The distinction between channels is increasingly unimportant because single transactions are already straddling both the physical and digital channels. Ultimately, we should be agnostic about which channels guests choose and enable them to interact with us where and when they want to; in our stores, digitally, or preferably both.","First quarter penetration on our REDcards was 20.4%, up 3.3 percentage points from last year. This is very healthy growth, but a couple of percentage points below rates we were seeing prior to the data breach. In the first quarter, as research showed that most consumers are putting the breach behind them, we ramped up REDcard offers to guests in our stores, and by the end of the quarter, we were making those offers with the same frequency as before the breach. When we make an offer, the application rate for our credit card has largely recovered to pre-breach levels, but the rate for the debit card is responding less quickly. As a result, we expect slower U.S. REDcard penetration growth in the second quarter, up between 200 basis points and 300 basis points from last year. Looking ahead as part of our broader effort to rebuild traffic and sales, we work hard to reaccelerate REDcard growth, particularly the debit product through our marketing and an enhanced focus on the role our store team members play in generating REDcard applications. ","Our first quarter U.S. segment EBITDA margin rate was 9.5%, down nearly a percentage point from last year, driven by a gross margin to current rate decline of more than one percentage point.","As Kathee mentioned, we ramped up the intensity of our deals in the first quarter to get guests back into our stores and this decision was reflected both in better sales in traffic and a lower gross margin rate. Our SG&A rate improved about 30 basis points from last year, reflecting outstanding discipline across the Company, including the benefit of our expense optimization efforts as well as the timing of some expenses compared to last year.","In our Canadian segment, first quarter sales were below expectations in February and March, but were better than expected in April. Our first quarter gross margin rate was 18.7%, much better than the fourth quarter, but still below our full year expectation as we worked to clear excess inventory on long lead time receipts. Expense rates were much better than a year ago, reflecting scale benefits and the comparison to last year's preopening costs. ","First quarter REDcard penetration was 3.9% was nearly double last year's rate, but still well below where we believe it will be over time. ","Consistent with last quarter beyond operating results, our first quarter GAAP earnings reflected several items that reduced EPS by approximately $0.04. These items included data breach related costs net of an insurance receivable, continued reduction and the beneficial interest asset and a charge related to our decision to move from Visa to MasterCard for our co-branded REDcard credit product.","Turning to consolidated metrics, our first quarter interest expense of $170 million was down more than $450 million from a year ago, as we annualized the first quarter 2013 charge for the early retirement of high coupon debt.","We returned $272 million in dividends this quarter, up from $232 million last year as our $0.43 per share quarterly dividend was more than 19% higher than a year ago. We plan to recommend that our Board authorize another similar increase this summer.","We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter. While we expect to generate cash well beyond our expected uses over the next several years, our current metrics are beyond typical boundaries of our middle A cart rating. As a result, we do not expect to repurchase shares in the second quarter and may resume repurchases in the back half of the year at the earliest. To resume this activity, we need to see continued improvement in our U.S. and Canadian operations, moving our credit metrics back to acceptable levels, relative to our single A rating. In addition, we believe it's prudent to hold off on any repurchases until we have more visibility into our potential liability for third party, card networks fraud and administrative costs related to the data breach. Based on what we know today, we do not expect to have visibility into those claims until the third quarter or later.","I'll turn now to our outlook for both the second quarter and our updated expectations for the full year. Given our current trends and challenges in both the U.S. and Canada, we believe it's appropriate to maintain a cautious outlook for sales in both segments. This allows us to plan inventory and hours effectively, while building contingency plans to allow us to flex higher as sales grow more rapidly than expected. We've updated our full year expectations for profitability in both segments, taking a more cautious view in light of the environment and the additional steps we're taking to grow U.S traffic and sales, accelerate improvement in our Canadian operations and step up the development of our digital capabilities.","While we don't expect these additional efforts to change our 2014 capital expenditures in a meaningful, we are planning for lower operating margins in both segments as we dedicate additional resources to make progress. Specifically, we expect to invest more in gross margin for newness, product innovation and promotions in both the U.S. and Canada to enhance our value proposition across both sides of the Expect More, Pay Less brand promise, and incur incremental expenses as we devote more resources to improve operations in Canada and speed up the development of digital and flexible fulfillment capabilities in the U.S. Longer-term, we believe these investments will be paid back in the form of faster, profitable growth and increasing market share in both segments.","One note. Consistent with guidance last quarter, our outlook does not include potential additional costs related to the data breach beyond what we've already recognized as they're still not estimable. As I mentioned, we continue to believe we have the financial strength to move beyond these near-term impacts once they are known even as we continue to invest to grow in both of our segments.","So with that context, let's turn first to our expectations for the second quarter. In the U.S, we expect a slower improvement in sales trends, meaning, second quarter comparable sales should be flat to slightly positive. We expect U.S. segment EBITDA margin rate will be below last year's 10.8% rate, but we expect a smaller year-over-year decline than we experienced in the first quarter. Both gross margin and SG&A expenses will be pressured by our efforts to grow traffic and expand our digital capabilities, but we also expect an offsetting benefit of both gross margin and SG&A expense lines from our expense optimization efforts.","In Canada, we expect sales measured in U.S. dollars to be up about 75% from last year's second quarter and about 25% higher than the first quarter. We will report Canadian segment comparable sales for the first time in the second quarter, but this measure will be highly volatile in the near-term as we'll be measuring in our small set of stores. Specifically, we expect to report a single-digit decline in second quarter Canadian segment comparable sales as we'll be comparing against the very large grand opening surges we experienced a year ago, combined with the impact of our market densification later in 2013, which redistributed sales from our initial openers. ","We expect the Canadian segment gross margin rate will improve beyond 20% in the second quarter, but will continue to reflect pressures from promotions and efforts to eliminate excess inventory. Expense rates in this segment should show modest improvement from our first quarter rates, but will remain elevated far beyond what they'll be in the long run. Altogether, second quarter Canadian segment EBITDA losses measured in U.S dollars are expected to be approximately flat to last year. ","We expect second quarter consolidated interest expense to be approximately flat to last year and tax expenses to be somewhat lower. Altogether, our expectations would generate adjusted EPS reflecting results from both our U.S. and Canadian operations of $0.85 to $1, excluding $0.02 related to the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any potential cost related to the data breach.","For the full year, we continue to expect U.S. comparable sales in a range of flat to up 2% and we still expect an SG&A expense rate of about 20%. However, we've taken our gross margin rate expectations down below 30% to make room to invest more in products and promotion."," In our Canadian segment, in light of recent trends we've taken down our full-year sales expectations closer to US$2 billion and with that new view of sales, we expect lower gross margin rate and higher expense rates than before. Specifically, we now expect our full-year Canadian segment EBITDA margin rate will be closer to minus 20% compared with our prior expectation closer to minus 10%. Altogether, these updated expectations will put our full-year adjusted EPS in a range of $3.60 to $3.90, $0.25 lower than the range we provided a quarter ago. ","While these are our current expectations based on where we are today, I don't want to create the impression that we're satisfied. Recent management changes, including yesterday's announcements, demonstrate that we believe meaningful changes needed put us on a different long run trajectory. In Canada, we need much more urgency to improve our operations, so our systems and supply team can enable the rapid growth in sales we'll be driving to achieve scale. In the U.S., even though we're seeing industry leading growth in the digital channels, we need to grow even faster to catch up with others who have been on the journey for a much longer time. And we need to become much more willing to deliver more newness and differentiation to our guests. Given that we're already known for it, we need to continually raise the bar on what newness means. Providing our guests with a sense of inspiration and discovery that makes them want to visit us more often in whatever channel they choose.","With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Two questions. The first one I want to ask is sort of a governance related question, so answer it as you can. You talked about some of the Company's initiatives and your case, strategic direction and areas where you felt perhaps the Company had fallen short. Were any of these areas, themes where perhaps Greg and the Board or Greg and the rest of the management team had a difference of opinion such that your focus on them today would be different from what the firm's focus on that had been under his leadership?","John Mulligan","Matt, all I can tell you is what we're focused on going forward, and we're focused -- Kathee and I and the whole leadership team have been talking to the team for the past couple of weeks about our focuses on driving the business forward, and we have three key objectives; drive sales and traffic in the U.S, accelerate our operational improvement in Canada and ultimately our business performance; and then third, accelerate our transformation and get to be a leading Omni-channel retailer in the U.S., and that's where we have the teams focused.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. and then my second question just a quick one, on Canada, if you could try to help us frame the magnitude of inventory sort of left in the pipeline that you need to clear, maybe how much of a factor that was in the grosses is Q1, and whether that\u2019s -- whether you're cleaned up at this stage?","John Mulligan","Matt, as you know, when sales get out of -- when sales aren't on expectation and inventories get a little heavy, they get lumpy. And so there's areas where we're a little bit heavier than we'd like. There\u2019s areas where we're a little bit lighter than we'd like, and we're working to, I'd say, balance all of the inventories. And a lot of it frankly will be dependent on do we meet our sales objectives? In the first quarter, a little bit light, but not materially so, and if we continue to hit our sales objectives, I think we'll see our inventories smooth out over the course of the year and be in a manageable position for the remainder of the year. I don't know if there's anything you'd add, Kathee?","Kathryn Tesija","Yeah. The thing that I would add, Matt, is we're working on making sure that our forecasts are accurate and then as we buy into them that we've got chase and cancel plans built in so that we're able to react in-season versus what we've done this past year without any history and having to react at the end of the season to clear more. So we're still lumpy. We still have products to clear. We're getting our arms around that forecast, and I think that will help us as we move through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Drbul with Nomura.","Robert Drbul \u2013 Nomura Securities","Just two questions, I guess first, in terms of the search for our new CEO, is there like a reasonable timeframe that you think it can be resolved? And then the second question is on the share repurchase, you gave a lot of detail on it. Is it -- in terms of the second half confidence level, do you think that you will have better visibility? And what gives you that visibility around the cost of the breach in that third quarter? Just I'd like to better understand that situation.","John Mulligan","Sure. On the first question of the CEO search, certainly that's under the Board's purview and I would tell you rather than focused on time, they're focused on getting the right individual to lead the Company as I said to become an Omni-channel retailer. So that's they're focus and the time we'll take as long as it's appropriate to get the right person. On the second one on share repurchase and specifically related to the potential breach liabilities, getting visibility to that in the second half of the year there is a process that is agreed to with the networks. They get some information from their forensics investigator and then they go through a process to evaluate incremental fraud, where we may have potential liability. and then they come back to us after a period of time. And as we've looked at that historically we've seen that that's taken several months and that's why we get to the third quarter. We don't have frankly, Bob, a lot of visibly to that, but as I said, as we've looked at other incidents, that's what we've seen in the past for timing of when some of those potential liabilities may become more clear.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group","I had a couple of questions. John and Kathee, it sounds like growing that digital is a key focus right now and driving that faster. Could you help us understand where we start from like what percentage of your sales or maybe some of the cross shopping between REDcard members and how much they shop online or maybe how those people season after they've had a REDcard a few years. Anything you have on that I think will be helpful.","John Mulligan","Sure. I'll talk maybe a little bit about where we are today and Kathee can talk about what we're doing to drive growth there. The sales in our business, somewhere between 2% and 3%. Digital channel originated probably in the 2.5% range right now. REDcards, given the free shipping online, we have a lot of our REDcards guests shopping online and, I think, we've talked in the past, Greg, we have a very high penetration of online orders that we free ship because of that REDcard. We think it's absolutely the right incentive or part of that loyalty package for REDcard, but it drives a very high penetration. Kathee can talk about where we're going.","Kathryn Tesija","Yeah. In terms of growth, Greg, mobile is where we're really focused and about two-thirds of our traffic right now comes from mobile. So we're really pleased with the results that we've seen there, not only in traffic but also conversion. We did improve conversion both in the site and on mobile and in total and you know that mobile conversion is lower than site conversion. So that headwind from the mix is there, but we still improved overall conversion. So, we're happy with that. There's also a lot of new things that we're doing. Certainly there's product introductions, I talked about the furniture a few minutes ago. There's always new stuff that we're adding on the site. We're expanding. We've got almost all store product online now, set up online, lots to be sold online. But now we're adding out in other areas where we should have a much larger section and we think online is the place to do that; things like apparel, beauty. ","In addition to that, there's a lot of services that we are adding that are doing really well. We've talked about buy online, pick-up in store. Subscriptions has been really successful for us. We started last fall with about 150 SKUs, and in those items our online sales were about 15% in subscriptions, so with no marketing and just beta on the site. So we've now got about 1,500 items and by June we'll have 5,000 items that will be available for subscriptions. And when guests purchase those items, they'll be able to get 5% discounts for signing up for subscriptions. So, a lot of product and a lot of services that go with that to drive our growth.","Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group","That\u2019s great. And if I could follow up on the guidance, it sounds like it's really margin investment in Canada that has taken the guidance down if I've summarized that right. You left the comp the same in the U.S. If we get back to that zero to plus 2, do you expect traffic to be positive at all as part of that guidance, or do you think it could still be negative through the year?","John Mulligan","Yeah, I think, if you mean for an annual number, getting to an annual positive traffic number, very difficult. We're working hard on increasing traffic for each of the quarters, and I think our benchmark is, are we seeing continued improvement in traffic as we go sequentially. But for the full year, even if we just pick a number, ran 1 comp, I don't think we'll see positive traffic for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Nemer with Wells Fargo.","Matthew Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","I'm just wondering on the digital transformation that you talked about. Is there a target level of investment from both the P&L and a CapEx standpoint?","John Mulligan","I don't think there is a target level of investment. I think first from a CapEx standpoint, our approach has been, we're going to invest in all the investments the business needs to grow profitably and generate appropriate returns. The length of time over which those returns occur, we have a very long lead time as we think about capital investment. Stores have a very long return cycle. So we're used to making investments that payback over a long period of time. From an expense standpoint, I think there probably the biggest investment and where you'll see us accelerate is in speed and doing more testing and learning. And that's not just digital, but also in our store, just getting more activities out into the business that we're testing, we're modifying and adjusting and improving on and if it doesn't work pull it back and retreat from that and learn from the testing. ","I think the best example of that is Cartwheel. We put that out in beta. We knew there were things about the app that we didn't particularly like. Our guests let us know what they didn't like about the app. The team iterated and iterated and one year later and really not with much marketing until more recently, we have 7 million users and the app has evolved as our guests have provided us feedback. And as Kathee talked about, a lot of the merchandising initiatives in baby and in apparel and in toys and in electronics, that's the same approach we've taken. Get it out in the stores, modify it, test it somewhere else and modify and then we'll move to scale. So those are the investments we'll see in expensive. And I don't think that is limited by some false number of expense dollars we have to allocate toward it. It will be driven by the appropriateness of what we're testing.","Kathryn Tesija","Yeah, the thing that I would add to that, Matt, the reason for getting more out, historically we've tended to work on our newness until we felt we got to almost complete level and then we would put into pilot. The point now and John\u2019s point about Cartwheel and some of the in-store things that we're doing, we want to get it in front of our guests very quickly, get their reaction to it, so that we're fine-tuning it much more quickly and then able to move out -- to rollout at a much faster pace, with the product and a service that we know our guests will love.","Matthew Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. And secondly, can you talk to the early cycle stores versus the later cycle stores in Canada? Anything you can share on the difference between the financial metrics in the various cohorts? Thanks.","John Mulligan","Yeah, as we said, we continue to see improvement across the business into April as the guest data improved and our sales performance improved and the early cycle stores continue to be the best. And it's again, almost in order down the sheet, one cycle, two cycle, three cycle, four cycle, five. So the earliest stores, the longer they've been open, they performed the better, but the good thing is all cycles are on an upward path. We're not where we need to be and we're not where we need to be versus our expectations, but it's good to start to see some progress.","Kathryn Tesija","And I think the key to each of those cycles and improving them is getting this history under our belt and now we can forecast more accurately as we move forward. And as John said, we're very committed to accelerating our performance in Canada and we think that it will continue to go by cycle as it has this past year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.","Sean Naughton \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Two questions, first on online and I guess, specifically Amazon, it seems to continue to infringe on Target's everyday business and increasingly the consumable category. So I guess the question is two-fold. Do you feel like that you're making good progress here on slowing the bleed of sales? And then secondly, have you seen any impact from the recent changes in your trends in markets where Amazon is now being forced to collect some sales tax online?","John Mulligan","I'll take the second one and then Kathee can answer the first. I think on sales tax, we definitely see an impact when Amazon collects sales tax, and particular in states that have much higher sales taxes to begin with where essentially the price differential is much more meaningful. And so we've definitely seen that impact as we've watched them collect sales taxes across the country. And Kathee can talk about the rest.","Kathryn Tesija","Yeah. In terms of our online business, the part that I'm very encouraged about is that as comScore reports, when we look at traffic on our site versus the top seven retailers, we led by far. And obviously Amazon has a lot of traffic, but it was flat in the quarter and ours was up considerably. So I'm pleased with the changes that we're making to this site with the user experience. And the added product that we're adding is driving that guest behavior and that we're seeing the traffic. Clearly Amazon is doing very well and they have in the consumables category a lot of business. We are now ramping that up, starting with some more style-related consumable business. If you think beauty, for example, you'll see us pushing forward their faster versus grocery which we're doing dry grocery now, but we're not working on refrigerated and frozen at this point.","Sean Naughton \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Then, I guess the second question on the logistics side of the organization, it sounds like you're having good success with the ship from store test and then buy online and pick-up in store at 10% of the sales seems to be going relatively well. Can you talk about any of the longer term P&L benefits from these initiatives both maybe from a topline and a margin perspective?","Kathryn Tesija","At this point I don't think we're ready to commit to what that will do from a financial perspective. Our main focus right now is what will most resonate with our guests, getting pilots out in beta so that we can learn and experience from them. Ultimately, we have to work to be profitable on all of those, but our main goal right now is sales driven and understanding guest's behavior so that we can then tailor the assortment to suit them and be profitable at it. I will tell you, I've been really pleased with some of these new initiatives and how rapidly our guest is responding to them. ","Store pick-up is the biggest because it's now rolled out; ship from store, which was really a Minneapolis team member test so far, we're going to be expanding that in June and make that guest facing, having that $10 rush delivery in Boston, Minneapolis and Miami. And based on our team member response and the feedback that they gave us, I think that this will also resonate with our guess, so I'm really excited to see where that goes. Then later in the year, we're going to be adding standard shipping from 135 stores in about 38 markets and that will allow faster delivery, not the express that I just talked about, but one to two-day delivery and as well as provide access to the store assortment that you can't get right now on Target.com. So, lots of good things happening; not yet ready to say what it means in terms of our sales or our profit.","John Mulligan","I think Kathee is exactly right. Not ready to give a lot of guidance on sales profit and how it will all work out, but I would tell you, broadly, regardless of where the profit margin rates end up, pushing incremental sales across our existing assets will be a very good thing for return on invested capital and we're very excited about that. With that, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","A couple of quick things. I guess, I was curious as to Kathee, the change in the organization structure under you in merchandising, and like I guess what really prompted this now versus six months ago or next month or waiting for and -- a formal hire of a CEO in place.","Kathryn Tesija","I think, the point is that we want to accelerate newness and innovation in this interim period here. We've talked about interim doesn't mean idle. We are approaching our business with as much passion and focus on improving results as we always have. And in terms of this structure, I think as John mentioned, focusing on our top three priorities and having this merchant team really focus on the U.S., improving U.S. performance and leveraging deep functional expertise to be able to speed up that innovation and newness. So, for example, putting all of our style business together, both merchandising and design all under Trish Adams, having our essentials and hard lines business all under Jose Barra, having inventory and all operations under Keri Jones, and then our Omni-channel efforts all under Casey Carl, are really important to be able to leverage that expertise and move very quickly in improving our results.","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Got it. Thanks. That makes a lot of sense. If I could follow-up on that, was this something that Greg was reluctant to doing and does that have anything to do with the timing?","Kathryn Tesija","I'll just tell you that the Board has been very supportive on these changes. We've talked at length about getting the right people in the right chair to be able to drive our performance and we're really pleased with this structure and the people that we have leading these teams.","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Got it. Thank you. And then, just the one last thing I wanted to ask and I apologize if I missed it in the discussion today, but as far as the price investments go, are they more in the consumables side, the discretionary side? Where are the areas you think you need to make an investment?","Kathryn Tesija","As we've been focusing on irresistible deals for our guests, we've invested in both sides. I gave you the example of the Coke ad that we ran, and I think it was in March. But we've also done broad categories on the wants side like the ultimate spring break sale or our baby sales. We're looking at really needs and wants and how do we invest in both sides to be able to delight our guests, and we've had great success in both categories.","John Hulbert","Thanks. That concludes our first quarter 2014 conference call. Thank you all for your participation.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday August 23, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer, Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on our second quarter performance, our outlook and progress on our long term strategic initiatives. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","This morning, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.","And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our second quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year and beyond. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks John. We are really pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which reflects the durable model we have built over the last several years. In building this model, we focused on making changes to ensure we maintain long term relevance with our guests, while positioning our business to grow profitably over time. When we began this journey to transform our business in 2017, we said that 2019 would be the year when we would be positioned to deliver profitable growth and our results through the first half of this year have certainly fulfilled that expectation.","On the topline, our business delivered second quarter comparable sales growth of 3.4%, driven primarily by traffic. This growth was on top of unusually strong comp growth of 6.5% in the second quarter last year, meaning that our comp sales have increased about 10% since 2017, our best two year stack performance in well over a decade. On the bottomline, our second quarter profitability was well ahead of our expectations. Our business delivered double digit growth in operating income, which translated into record high earnings per share numbers and more than 20% EPS growth over the last year.","Among our sales channels, second quarter comp sales grew 1.5% in our stores and 34% in our digital channels. Within our core merchandising categories, we saw more than 5% comp growth in both apparel and essentials. This reflects the broad value we deliver across all of our categories and the balance we achieved between our more discretionary areas like apparel, home and beauty and our less discretionary food and beverage and essential categories, which deliver consistent traffic throughout the year. Beyond our frequency categories, throughout the year, we focus on important seasonal moments in our guest lives and unique partnerships that create excitement and sustain our brand. At the beginning of the second quarter, we were really pleased with the guest response to our limited time partnership with Vineyard Vines, which was one of our most successful in our history. And near the end of the quarter, we saw encouraging early results in our back-to-school and back-to-college categories.","In our digital channels, we continue to see the most rapid growth in our same-day fulfillment options, in-store pickup, drive-up and Shipt, which together have more than doubled their sales in the last year. These options offer speed, convenience and reliability and as a result, they are quickly becoming the preferred fulfillment choices for our guests. And most importantly, because these options leverage our store infrastructure, technology and teams, same-day fulfillment delivers outstanding financial performance as well.","In our stores, which grew both traffic and basket in the second quarter, we continue to elevate both the environment and the level of service. We completed 84 remodels in the second quarter and we are on track to deliver approximately 300 this year. These projects transform the shopping environment featuring end-to-end improvements in our decor, lighting and merchandise displays. In addition, they incorporate changes to optimize digital fulfillment enabling speed and reliability for our guests and efficiency in support of our financial performance.","Within our product assortment, we continue to focus on providing a unique combination of quality, fashion and value across our owned, exclusive and national brands. Just ahead of the back-to-school season, we launched our new multi-category own brand, More Than Magic, which our team developed to appeal to guests in their tween years. And just this month, based on encouraging results in a 20-store pilot, we expanded our test of Levi's Red Tab denim for both men and women to 50 stores in college campuses and in high-traffic urban markets. We were pleased to be partnering with Levi's to showcase this iconic product line previously reserved for department stores, to more and more of our guests.","In recent years, many of our competitors have begun promoting cyber summer sales in the July period, which drives consumer interest in online shopping and causes a natural spike in our digital traffic. This seasonal spike creates a natural opportunity for us to thoughtfully invest in promotions, allowing us to gain mindshare and covert this traffic into additional orders and sales. At the same time, the acceleration in order volume allows us to test the agility of our operations in advance of the fourth quarter peak. I am pleased to report, like last year, performance of our July deal days event was outstanding, both in terms of guest response to our promotions as well as the ability of our operations to handle the surge in demand.","And while I am on this subject of agility and operations, I want to take a moment and address the system outages which affected our cash registers and payment systems during a busy weekend in June. These outages disappointed our guests. And once again, I want to apologize for the inconvenience it caused. While our business still delivered an outstanding quarter, these outages are a stark reminder of the need for us continue to focus on execution across every aspect of our business every day. On the positive side, I couldn't be more proud of our store teams across the country who put our guest first and worked tirelessly to minimize the inconvenience to our guests. And I also want to thank our headquarters teams who scrambled quickly to assess root causes and recover our systems in a very short time. I have said this before and I see it every day, we have the best team in retail.","As we step back and look at our results throughout the first half of the year, our teams have delivered really outstanding performance ahead of our expectations. Comparable sales have grown more than 4%. Operating income has grown more than 13%. And GAAP and adjusted EPS have each grown about 20%. This performance puts us in a strong position as we enter the back half of the year.","However, as we look ahead to the balance of the year, we are mindful of the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace, including the timing and extent of additional China tariffs. As you know, the list of products in line for new tariffs include a broad set of consumer categories, including apparel, electronics, toys and home. As a result, we have been following developments carefully and we are encouraged that many items originally slated for tariff increases in September have now been delayed until later in the year.","But as long as the trade situation remains fluid, it will present an additional layer of uncertainty and complexity as we plan our business. Against that backdrop, we expect to continue to benefit from our diverse multi-category assortment, deep expertise in global sourcing and a sophisticated set of manufacturing partners around the world. As a result, we are confident in our ability to navigate this period of heightened volatility and move our business forward. And we are really excited about our plans for the balance of the year in which we will continue to deliver excitement, innovation, convenience and value to our guests.","Beyond the back-to-school and back-to-college season, we are excited this quarter to be bringing back hundreds of items from 20 different designers to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Target's first designer partnership. And just this week, we announced our newest own brand in food and beverage, Good & Gather, which our team designed to make it easy for families to discover the joy of food. Over the next few months, we will be completing more than 100 additional remodels. So more and more of our guests can enjoy an enhanced store shopping experience in time for the holiday season. And of course, we will continue expanding our rollout of drive-up and Shipt across the chain, bringing enhanced speed and convenience to more and more of our guests across the country.","Putting this altogether, in both the third and the fourth quarter, we are planning to deliver comparable sales growth in line with the 3.4% pace we established in the second quarter. As we plan for the profitability of those sales, our guidance reflects the most recent announcements about the extent and timing of China tariffs. Altogether, based on our performance in the first half of the year and our outlook for the back half, we expect to generate full year GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $5.90 to $6.20, an increase of $0.15 from our prior range. While we certainly see the potential for us to outperform the midpoint of this range, we believe it strikes the appropriate balance between the outstanding trends we have been seeing so far this year and the financial flexibility we will need to manage through a volatile environment. And finally, for the third quarter, we are planning GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 to $1.24.","So, before I turn the call over to John, I want to recognize our team for their efforts to deliver such outstanding performance in 2019, but I also want to recognize their hard work over the last few years, which has allowed us to transform nearly every aspect of our business. Without those efforts, we might have found ourselves in the unfortunate position of many of our competitors who are struggling to perform in the face of rapid changes in the consumer and the marketplace. Through the tough times, our team stuck with us. They believed in our plan, they believed in each other and they believed in our brand. And today, I am incredibly honored to be able to share the outstanding results of their work.","With that, I will turn the call over to John for an update on our digital fulfillment capabilities and our plans to continue to grow. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks Brian. This quarter provided further evidence of the payback we are realizing on the investments we have made over the last several years to transform our assets, our capabilities and our team. This work has created an operational model that can generate growth on both the topline and the bottomline, as you saw on our second quarter results.","One place where it's easy to see the impact of our new model is in digital fulfillment where the mix is moving dramatically towards our same-day services, in-store pickup, drive-up and Shipt. In the second quarter, these three services accounted for more than a third of our digital sales, up from about 20% last year. In other words our same-day options are growing much faster than our digital sales. Specifically, combined sales for in-store pickup, drive-up and Shipt have more than doubled over the last year, accounting for nearly three quarters of Target's 34% digital comp in the second quarter.","That means that nearly 1.5 percentage points of the company's overall comp growth was driven by our same-day services. These are remarkable statistics and they demonstrate how rapidly our guests are learning about and embracing these new convenient options. For many guests, they are becoming the go-to choice for their digital shopping because they offer unique advantages. They are immediate. They allow guests to shop and receive their order on the same day. They are convenient. Guests can choose where they receive their order, either at the front of the store, in the parking lot or at home. They are fast. Our standard is for drive-up guest to receive their order in less than two minutes and our average is comfortably better than the standard.","And finally, these services provide certainty. Guest don't have to wonder when a package will arrive at their house and what will happen to the package if they are not at home. And of course it eliminates the need to deal with opening and recycling a stack of cardboard boxes every week. With these advantages, it's no wonder that our same-day offerings receive some of the highest net promoter scores of anything we offer, which means the guest want to use these services again and again after they have tried them.","So if you simply apply a guest-first mentality, you quickly see the value of our investments to develop and roll out our same-day options across the country. But what's even better that these services also make sense for our business because they leverage existing store assets and our store teams in new ways. As a result, our same-day options are also the most profitable within our digital offering.","Over the last few years, we have made a concerted effort to increase the efficiency of all of our store fulfillment options including both our same-day and ship from store capabilities. As a result, since the beginning of 2018, order picking efficiency for pickup and drive-up has increased more than 30%. And similarly, end-to-end labor efficiency for our ship from store capability has also improved by more than 30% over that same period. These are massive improvements which we realized through the natural scale efficiencies we see on higher volume, which are compounded by incorporating improved processes and technology.","These tactics include creating larger batches for picking orders based on the goal to balance efficiency, speed to guest and the guest experience, optimizing the path for the picking to minimize steps to the backroom and sales floor. During seasonal peaks, batches are further segmented into subsections of the store like back-to-school orders this time of the year. Applying new algorithms to prioritize the sequence of order picking based on a range of criteria rather than simply applying a first-in, first-out system, implementing new technology to eliminate ambiguity for our store team members about which work to perform first, when work is due and the optimal box size for packing orders.","And of course, enhancing data reporting for store teams to track the unit efficiency of both pick and pack. This supporting updates constantly throughout the day and provides leaders the ability to understand the drivers of their teams' performance in real-time. These efforts have been focused on store fulfillment. But we have been focused on every step of the guest shopping journey, including returns. We have always offered free in-store returns of digital orders. The guest sometimes prefer to ship their returns back to us.","To make that process seamless, we have worked with our shipping partners to expedite the process of a return for a digital order. Under the new process, after a guest prints their return label at home and either drops it off or schedule pickup at the home, they receive credit for the return as soon as our third party shipping partners scans the return label. This means that refunds are received in a guest credit or debit card account days earlier than before and our guests have noticed. And our guest survey scores have seen a meaningful improvement in the level of satisfaction for refund timeliness, compared with last year.","So clearly, we have done a lot to support our digital growth but we shouldn't forget about store sales which continue to account for more than 90% of our total volume. As we have been saying for years, we believe that in-store shopping will continue to be important and account for the vast majority of retail sales for many years to come. However, in a world where consumers have more choices than ever, inferior brick-and-mortar experiences will go away. That's why we are investing heavily both in our store assets and in the experience our team provides.","Regarding the store assets themselves, we are in the middle a three-year period in which we plan to remodel about 300 stores each year, a more rapid pace than we have ever accomplished. As Brian mentioned, these remodels transform the entire store experience and optimize them for digital fulfillment. And as we have covered in past quarters, we continue to see first year traffic and sales lift in line with our original expectations and second year lifts that we didn't originally anticipate.","As successful as our remodel program has been, we continue to look for ways to refine our process. We continually analyze the results of completed remodels and apply those learnings into our project plans, so next year's remodels won't look the same as the ones we completed last year. We are also finding ways to mitigate the challenges of our guest face when construction is in process, which is leading to smaller average sales disruption than we experienced last year. And while guests are enjoying the upgraded look and feel of their new store, they are also experiencing a change in the way our team serves them.","That's because over the last few years, we have been rolling out a completely new operating model for our store team. This new model is simpler and focused on our guests rather than accomplishing tasks. We have also created more specialized roles in which team members bring their expertise to categories like food, beauty, electronics and apparel. The second quarter was the first time we had the new model fully implemented across the country and we continue to be happy with the results.","For example, we are seeing improved guest survey scores on questions about their interactions with our team, both on the sales floor and the checkout. Beyond the guest experience, we are also seeing the benefit of the operating model in our financial performance. Like everyone else, we are currently experiencing meaningful wage inflation in a very tight labor market. However, because of our ongoing investments in our team and this new operating model, we are seeing strong efficiency improvements in our stores, which is helping to mitigate the impact of higher wages.","Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to talk about our longer term vision for the supply chain. Specifically, I want to address the questions we continue to hear about the long term prospects for our strategy of using our stores as fulfillment hubs. One form of the question is to ask if this strategy is only feasible when Target's digital sales are still small. My first reaction is to wonder if it's appropriate to consider digital sales of well over $5 billion to be small. But I will stick to what's most important and talk about how we expect to deliver much higher volumes of store fulfilled digital sales over time and based on the questions we have been getting from many of you, I want to cover three distinct questions about our capacity to accommodate growth.","The first question pertains to the ability of our stores to fulfill higher levels of digital sales within their existing square footage. On that question, our experience shows that our stores have a very long runway of capacity. Think of it this way. Last year, stores fulfilled sales accounted for an average productivity of just over $300 per square foot and when you do the math, every additional $1 billion of store fulfilled sales would raise that productivity by about $4 a foot. In other words, if we double last year's $5 billion in digital sales and fulfilled all of that extra volume in our stores, we would see our average store sales productivity rise by just over $20 a foot.","So the question is, can our stores accommodate that volume in their existing space? The answer is clearly, yes. And the easiest way to see that is by looking at the range of productivity of our stores across the chain. Specifically, our top quartile stores, a group consisting more than 450 locations delivered average per foot productivity of more than $430 last year. That's more than $100 higher than the average for the chain. So based on our success in operating that large set of stores, we believe we have a lot of room to grow our overall sales productivity through digital fulfillment.","But there is a second capacity question pertaining to the mix of space in our existing stores. Specifically, we often get asked whether we will need to expand our store backrooms as we continue to see rapid growth in store fulfilled digital sales. On that question, our internal modeling shows that we are not going to run up against any capacity constraints in the near term because our stores already have ample backroom space. Specifically, if we continue to simply apply our existing technology and processes and maintained a rapid rate of growth in store fulfilled sales, we wouldn't need additional store backroom capacity until well into the next decade.","And as an aside, that constraint would only occur during the two week long seasonal spike in the fourth quarter. However, we will only run up against that constraint if our technology and processes stay the same as they are today and that isn't our plan, just as our stores have consistently delivered ever higher productivity in their ability to fulfill conventional sales, we are investing in technology and processes that will allow our stores to continue to grow their backroom productivity as well.","Beyond the capacity of our stores and backrooms, the third capacity question we hear is whether, over time, we are going to need to invest in additional upstream distribution capacity to accommodate our growth. And for this question, our answer is clearly yes. But that shouldn't surprise anybody because we have been adding capacity throughout more than 50 years of growth in our stores. In other words, when you grow any type of sales, either a conventional store sales or a digital sale, eventually you will need that network capacity to serve the additional volume. But that doesn't mean we are sitting on a surprise addition to the CapEx plans we outlined at this year's financial community meeting. The capital plan we outlined that day already accounted for expected future investments in upstream capacity based on our plans to grow both store sales and digital sales in the years ahead. So in other words, adding network capacity isn't something beyond our plan, it's part of the plan we have already articulated.","No before I close, I want to thank the team for their work to turn theory into reality over the last few years. When we started, many people didn't think we would be able to grow store traffic and sales ever again. When we started, many people questioned whether store should play a central role in digital fulfillment. And when we announced our goal to move to a $15 minimum wage across the country by the end of 2020, many people didn't think we could accommodate those kinds of wage increases and generate profitable growth. But because of this team's dedication, vision and energy, we have been able to transform our business and deliver outstanding financial results. Through their efforts, our team has delivered the performance that has converted doubters into believers.","Now I will turn the call over to Mark who will talk about our merchandising performance in the second quarter and our plans for the third quarter and beyond. Mark?","Mark Tritton","Thanks John. As Brian mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on ways to deepen engagement of our guests across multiple facets of our merchandising assortment in discretionary and frequency categories, our own brands and national brands and different shopping occasions, including life events, holidays and every day shopping trips. Of course, the most visible indication of our guest engagement is our traffic growth, which we continue to see across both our stores and digital channels. Engagement can also be seen in the market share data, which continues to show gains across multiple dimensions of our business.","Between our core categories, second quarter growth was strongest in essentials and beauty and in apparel, both of which delivered comp increases above 5%. Results within essentials and beauty was strongest in baby, beauty and over-the-counter. Baby has been one of our strongest share stories for the last year and we saw continued gains in the second quarter. Beauty has also been on an amazing run as we have seen accelerating share gains for well over a year. In apparel, in the second quarter, we saw broad strength across a host of categories, including intimates and sleepwear, jewelry, accessories and shoes, baby and performance activewear. We were particularly pleased to see such strong trends at Target despite unfavorable weather trends during the quarter and soft sales conditions for the overall industry. As a result, we saw some unusually strong share gains across multiple parts of the apparel assortment in the second quarter.","Among the remaining core categories, both our food and beverage and home assortments saw low single digit increases in comparable sales. In food, results were led by adult beverages, which delivered another quarter of double digit growth. In home, results were led by decor. In hardlines this quarter, comp sales were approximately flat overall. Results were led by toys where growth continues at a more moderate pace, given that we annualize the closure of Toys \"R\" Us during the quarter. In addition, we saw healthy growth in our mobile category during the quarter. These areas of strengths were offset by comp declines in our electronics and entertainment categories, reflecting in overall lack of industry newness in their product assortments. We are expecting this performance to strengthen in the back half of the year as both of these categories will benefit from new launches and product introductions by our vendor partners.","To continue to deepen guest engagement, we focus on delivering a constant drum beat of newness and innovation, elevating key life moments for our guests, while making it easier than ever to fulfill their everyday needs. All add great value. We kicked off the second quarter with our blockbuster limited time partnership with Vineyard Vines and we were really pleased with the results. This is one of our biggest brand partnerships in recent history. And we are happy to see the traffic and sales came in ahead of our forecast. This partnership was also an important moment for our brand as we saw high digital engagement and an amazing amount of buzz in social media.","Also in the quarter, we are pleased with the results for both Mother's Day and Father's Day holidays. Some of our strongest share gains of the quarter occurred during these holiday periods, particular in men's and women's apparel but also in toys and kids. And as Brian mentioned, late in the quarter we were pleased with our early results in our back-to-school and back-to-college programs, which are second only to the fourth quarter holiday season in terms of importance. Strategically planned right before the back-to-school season, we launched our newest own brand More Than Magic, which is a complete lifestyle brand, spanning sportswear, dancewear and gymnastics apparel, jewelry, accessories, beauty, electronics and even stationary.","Our team developed this brand to appeal to tween girls who are looking to move beyond Cat & Jack, but aren't quite ready to move up to a juniors assortment and brands like Wild Fable. Central to the More Than Magic brand is a theme of empowerment through positive messaging on products like apparel and notebooks. In addition, based on feedback we received from both tweens and their parents, all the beauty products in this new brand are made without parabens and weren't tested on animals. We are really excited to launch this new brand at a time when many more mall-based alternatives are closing their doors and we have been very pleased with the early results since the launch.","As we look ahead, we are really excited about our plans for the third quarter when we will continue to invest in newness across both our owned and national brand assortment. As Brian mentioned, earlier this month, we expanded our pilot with Levi's in which we are offering products with the iconic Red Tab label for the first time. Based on the success of our pilot in which we offered men's Red Tab products in 20 stores, we just added another 30 stores to the test and we have expanded the assortment to feature items for both men and women including jeans, tops and jackets. Of course, we are now offering the entire assortment on target.com and given that Levi's is one of the most searched brands on our website, we are excited to offer our digital guest access this iconic label for the first time.","Also this quarter, we are preparing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of our design partnerships which began with our friend, Michael Graves. Then, as today, our goal was to democratize the marketplace and offer incredible design at an affordable price, something we called Design For All. So after 20 years and more than 175 different partnerships, this quarter we are going to celebrate by opening the archives and bringing back nearly 300 items from 20-plus design partnerships and feature them in our anniversary collection. Prices will range from $6 up to $160, with most items priced below $50 and reflecting our commitment to inclusivity, all of the women's apparel items will be available in extended sizing. We will feature the anniversary collection in all of our stores and on target.com beginning on September 14.","And finally, the food and beverage team is looking forward to the upcoming launch of our new own brand, Good and Gather, which we just announced earlier this week. We know that food and beverage is a big reason our guests like shopping at Target since nearly three quarters of our baskets have at least one food item in them. And driven by the improvements we have implemented over the last two years, we have been seeing consistent growth and market share gains in food and beverage for well over a year. To build on this momentum, it's critical that our approach to every aspect of our food offering from selection to presentation brings joy to our guest lives. So in developing this brand, the product design and development team is focused on delivering taste, quality and ease.","And importantly, the entire assortment is made without artificial flavors, synthetic colors, artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup, helping our guest to feel confident they are serving their families affordable great tasting food that doesn't cut corners on quality ingredients. Good and Gather will become Target's flagship food brand with extensions focused on kids, organic and signature product lines. It will launch with over 650 items from dairy to produce, ready-made pastas and meat to granola bars and sparkling water. And by the full set next year, it will 2,000-plus products strong. It will launch in all Target stores and on target.com, the same-day delivery beginning on September 15.","Before I turn the call over to Cathy, I want to pause and thank our team for their energy and focus on delivering more for our guests. After all, our brand promise starts with expect more, more newness, quality, innovation and aspiration. More value, joy and every day surprises. More of what our guests need and more of what they want. And all at an amazing value. That's how we deliver on the pay less side of our brand promise whether offering organic pasta or a fashion item from a low-cost designer, all delivered at an accessible price. When you come to work at Target, the first thing you notice is the quality of the team, their passion for our business and their pride in working for this low-cost company and iconic brand. Across the company, the culture of innovation is infectious and the energy of the team feels limitless. I am so proud of what was already accomplished and I know there is so much more we can do in the months and years ahead.","So now I will turn it over to Cathy who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks Mark. As Brian mentioned, we saw outstanding financial performance in the second quarter as our business delivered sales growth that was in line with our expectations and bottomline results that were well above our expectations. Our comp sales growth of 3.4% on top of 6.5% last year put our two-year stacked growth at about 10%, our best performance in more than a decade.","Within our sales channels, stores comparable sales grew 1.5% and our comparable digital sales grew 34% on top of 41% growth a year ago. Among the drivers of total comp growth, we saw a 2.4% increase in traffic combined with a 0.9% increase in average ticket. We have long said that we are focused on driving traffic because it is a key indicator of Target's relevance with consumers. That's why we continue to be encouraged that traffic is growing both in our stores and our digital channels. And notably, this quarter, we were facing a really strong traffic comparison of 6.4% a year ago, meaning that our business just delivered the strongest two-year traffic performance we have ever reported.","On the gross margin line, second quarter performance exceeded our expectations as the rate expanded from 30.3% last year up to 30.6% this year. This was the first time in nearly three years that we have seen a year-over-year increase in our gross margin rate. This performance reflected the ongoing work of our merchant teams to optimize assortment, costs, pricing and promotions across all of our categories. In addition, we saw about 20 basis points of benefit from category sales mix, reflecting really strong apparel performance, combined with a moderating growth rate in toys and baby. These tailwinds were partially offset by about 30 basis points of pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs.","Even though we continue to grow digital sales at a very rapid pace, we are seeing less pressure from fulfillment costs, given that we are leveraging our store's teams and assets to fulfill the vast majority of our digital volume. And as Brian and John described, we are seeing incredibly rapid growth of low-cost digital fulfillment options like in-store pickup and drive-up. As a result, gross margin rate pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs in this year's second quarter was about half of the amount we were seeing a year ago.","Moving down to the SG&A expense line, we saw about 50 basis points of improvement in the second quarter. This performance was also better than expected and was driven by multiple factors, including favorability in asset impairments and the timing benefit of marketing and store expenses that will come back later in the year. In addition, our expense performance continues to reflect remarkable discipline across our entire organization which is key to sustaining outstanding performance over time. As John mentioned earlier, an important example is our store teams who are delivering meaningful productivity improvement that are helping us to offset the impact of rapidly rising wages across the country.","Our second quarter depreciation and amortization expense rate was approximately flat to last year as an increase in D&A expense dollars was offset by the benefit of higher sales. Given recent changes to our investment plans, we are now planning for higher accelerated depreciation than we originally expected for the year. One example relates to investments that will allow our stores to accommodate high volume of pickup and drive-up orders during the holiday season. For stores that have particularly high volumes of pickup and drive-up orders, we will be deploying flexible fixtures that will allow the stores to temporarily expand their holding capacity at the front of the store during periods of peak demand. This will allow the stores to maintain their high level of performance in fulfilling pickup and drive-up orders, a key reason we have seen such rapid adoption of these services.","In total, our business saw a meaningful improvement in our second quarter operating margin rate, which expanded about 80 basis points from 6.4% last year to 7.2% this year. As Brian mentioned, this was well ahead of our expectations, putting us in a great position to deliver outstanding financial performance for the full year.","Moving further down the P&L, second quarter interest expense was up $5 million from second quarter 2018, reflecting higher average debt balances compared with a year ago. And our income tax rate was 23%, consistent with the expected range for the year. As a result, net earnings from continuing operations grew $139 million over last year, an increase of 17.4%. At the end of the quarter, our diluted share count was about 3.8% lower than a year ago, reflecting our continued disciplined approach to capital deployment. Putting all this together, our business generated GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted EPS of $1.82, both more than 20% higher than a year ago, setting new record highs for the company.","So now I want to turn to cash flow, capital deployment and return on invested capital. But first I want to reiterate our priorities for capital deployment, which have been consistent for decades. As we look to deploy our cash, we first fully invest in capital projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support our dividend and extend our record of annual dividend increases, which we have maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we deploy any excess cash beyond those two uses for share repurchase within the limits of our middle-A credit rating.","So how have these priorities played out in 2019. Through the first half of the year, our operations have generated about $2.8 billion in cash, up from about $2.7 billion in the first half of 2018. We have deployed that cash to invest about $1.4 billion in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $658 million and repurchased $618 million of our stock. For the full year, we continue to expect to invest about $3.5 billion dollars in CapEx, driven by our remodel program, other investments in store assets, new store openings and in our supply chain and technology capabilities. Looking beyond 2019, we anticipate a similar amount of CapEx in 2020 as we expect to maintain our current remodel pace of about 300 stores for one additional year. Beyond 2020, we expect to moderate the pace of our remodels to a longer term range of 150 to 200 a year. And as a result, beginning in 2021, we expect to see a moderation in the pace of annual CapEx into the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, closer to the level of D&A on our cash flow statement.","So now I want to finish my review of our second quarter results by discussing our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the quality of both our operating results and our capital deployment decisions. For the trailing 12-months through the second quarter, excluding discrete impacts of the 2017 tax reform legislation, our business generated an after-tax return on invested capital of 15%, compared with 14.2% a year ago. This is outstanding performance and it's even more encouraging to see the year-over-year improvement which clearly demonstrates the benefit of our consistent disciplined approach to capital deployment.","Turning to our guidance for the back half of the year, I will start with our expectations for comparable sales growth. As Brian mentioned, we expect our business to generate comp sales increases in both the third and fourth quarters, in line with the 3.4% comp growth we just delivered in the second quarter. This expectation recognizes recent trends, now that we fully annualized the closure of Toys \"R\" Us stores as well as our bottom-up plans for sales driving initiatives in the back half of the year. On the operating income line, we are expecting our third quarter rate will be flat to up slightly, reflecting unexpected improvement in our gross margin rate offset by pressure on the SG&A expense line. Our gross margin rate expectation reflects last year's supply chain and inventory related pressures that we don't expect to occur again this year. On the SG&A expense line, our expectation reflects the plans re-timing of spending within marketing and our store's teams from the second quarter into the third quarter. And as Brian mentioned, our outlook for the back half of the year includes expected cost resulting from the most recent announcements regarding China tariff.","Putting together all of our expectations, we are anticipating third quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS of $1.04 to $1.24. For the full year, our expectations reflect strong trends through the first half of the year, the re-timing of marketing and store cost into the back half of the year, updated expectations for accelerated depreciation and expected costs related to tariffs, including the increases currently scheduled for September and December. Reflecting all of these considerations, we expect to deliver full year GAAP EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EPS of $5.90 to $6.20, which is $0.15 higher than our previous range. The midpoint of this new range of approximately 10% higher than last year's GAAP EPS from continuing operations and 12% higher than last year's adjusted EPS. This is outstanding performance ahead of our original expectations for the year.","So before I turn it back over to Brian, I want to thank the entire Target team for everything they are doing to drive this outstanding performance. It reflects years of work by our team to transform our business and build a durable financial model. And it reflects our teams' passion for our guests and a relentless focus on strong execution every day. When we first announced our transformation plan at the beginning of 2017, we talked about the assets we had at our disposal, including well-maintained and well-located stores, powerful owned brands, an iconic Target brand, a strong balance sheet and a business that generates robust cash flow. But what was most important, both in 2017 and today, is the team that powers our business. As Brian said, we are lucky to have the best team in retail and every day I am grateful for the opportunity to work with them and learn from them.","Now, I will turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks Cathy. Before we move to your questions, I want to take a moment and acknowledge that my first Target earnings call was almost exactly five years ago today. And I think we all agree that Target has changed a lot in those five years. During that time, we exited our Canadian segment allowing our teams to devote all of their energy to our U.S. operations. We sold our pharmacy business to CVS, a transaction that has generated value for both companies. We rejuvenated our own brand portfolio, launching dozens of new brands across multiple categories. We went from simply selling on a website to integrating digital within every part of our business, positioning our stores at the center of the most comprehensive suite of digital fulfillment options in the U.S. We opened about 100 small format stores, reaching new neighborhoods in dense urban areas and around college campuses. And we made significant changes to our team and how we work, both at headquarters and our stores.","When I came to Target, I had an inside look at why this company had such a strong reputation for hiring and developing talent, Target has a unique an outstanding team and I am truly grateful for the opportunity to work with them. But what's most amazing is the patience and optimism that this team has shown over the last five years as we have handled some significant challenges together. That's why it's so rewarding to be able to share the amazing results that this team is delivering today. At the same time, we are focused on the need to stay hungry, see around corners and continually innovate and reinvent ourselves. The pace of change in our business doesn't look like it's poised to slow down anytime soon. But I am confident this team will continue to lead Target and the industry, allowing us to deliver outstanding results both this year and well into the future.","So with that, I want to thank you for your today. And now we will move on to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning everybody. This was obviously a big quarter for investors. You lapped Toys \"R\" Us. You had the register glitch on Father's Day weekend that some people pegged at 50 basis point headwind to comps. You had the weather. So can you shed any light on the cadence of the quarter in light of the weather? How mature was the Father's Day weekend glitch and the impact to comps? And then more broadly, the gains in apparel and continued gains in baby, what would you sort of rank order the big drivers that are allowing you to gain that share?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Chris, I will start. And I think as we look at the quarter, we saw very consistent performance throughout the 13 weeks of the quarter. And as I have said several times now, there is not one element that we can point to. We saw a very good response from both sides of our portfolio, both our style side and our essentials. Mark called out the strength that we saw in categories like apparel, but also strength in those household essentials that drive traffic to our stores and more and more visits to our site.","So it was a very balanced quarter, strength across our entire portfolio. And I think the team has been just very focused on executing our plans, both from a store standpoint and a digital standpoint. So it all added up to a very solid quarter. We think we delivered quality results throughout the quarter that led to traffic gains of 2.4%, a very strong comp, market share gains in many of our core categories and overall obviously delivered very strong bottomline performance. So I can't point to one specific element.","I - we saw consistent strength and great execution each and every day. And the investments we made in store remodels, the investments we are making in new small formats continue to perform very well. As we continue to scale and mature our suite of fulfillment options, the guest is reacting honestly very well to those options. We continue to see a great reaction to both our own brands and our national brand performance. But I think our team was just focused on executing our plan each and every day and I think it ended up with a very strong quarterly success.","Chris Horvers","And then as a follow-up, we are hearing a lot from the apparel side, the inventories in the apparel world are bloated given some of the channel shifts that they are experiencing and from some of the weather in the second quarter. Obviously, your inventory is flat year-over-year. But could you perhaps talk about how you look at the health of your inventory, particularly in the more seasonally sensitive areas? And frankly, given the momentum in the business, do you think that you are in a good enough in stock position to hit your guidance expectations? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Chris, based on the health of our business right now and the momentum we have going into the back half, we feel very good about our inventory position. Obviously, the strength of our performance in categories like apparel speaks for itself. But I think as we prepare for these big seasonal moments, I think we feel like we are in a great position for back-to-school and back-to-college. I would actually say it's the strongest position we have had in years as we get ready for the peak of college. And as we get ready for back-to-school that continue to surge over the next few weeks, I think we feel very good about our position and I think it's actually the best inventory position we have had in years in both of those categories.","Chris Horvers","Thank you. Best of luck.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Kate McShane","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I had was just about the timing of the expenses that were called out and why they shifted? And Cathy, I wondered if you could quantify how much favorability the asset impairment and the shift of expenses out of the quarter into Q3 benefited Q2?","Cathy Smith","Yes. Happy to. Good morning Kate. So first off, the magnitude of the expenses, both in marketing and our stores, as you have seen already beginning in Q3, we have got some amazing plans in Q3. So we just had some expenses to support those plans and it's probably in 40 basis point range, maybe a little lower -- sorry, $40 million range and maybe a little bit lower going from Q2 into Q3. So that's what you are seeing reflected on the SG&A line. And then you asked about, I am sorry, your second question was?","Brian Cornell","The impairment.","Cathy Smith","Yes, the impairment. Year-over-year, it reflects the strength of our business, actually, that we had very low to very little impairments this year versus what we have seen in the previous years. And so that was actually pretty significant and you will see that in the Q as well.","Brian Cornell","Kate, I am actually glad you called that out. Actually, we were talking prior to the call. While there's lots of highlights that we have already covered in the quarter and one of the things that stands out for me is the health of our assets and the performance of our stores. And I think that showed up in the change in asset impairment during the quarter.","Kate McShane","That's great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I know the tariff situation is very fluid, but if List 4 were to come to fruition on December 15, is that something that impacts 2019 or is it really a 2020 impact?","Brian Cornell","Kate, again, while we are watching this very carefully and obviously we know there has been a number of shifts over the last few weeks, as it sits right now, this is largely a 2020 issue. So we have got all of the current tariffs built into our guidance and our plan for the balance of the year. Mark and his team have done a sensational job of scenario planning as we get ready for the balance of this year and going into 2020. But as it's stated today, the impact of List 4 would be something that we would realize in the first quarter of 2020.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead.","Robby Ohmes","Good morning guys and congrats on a great quarter in a tricky environment out there. I was hoping to get some of you to talk more about the digital growth outlook. So digital came in, I think, well above what a lot of people were looking for. How should we think about that growth going forward? I think you guys had pegged it around 25% for the year. Can you do a lot better than that? And maybe an update on how many store pick-up locations and drive-up locations you are at or you may be accelerating that? And are more categories coming into pick-up and drive-up, like fresh produce, et cetera? Just any help you can give us there would be great. Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Robby, why don't we let John kind of walk through some of the highlights of our digital performance, which again was very strong during the quarter, up 34% on top of significant growth last year.","John Mulligan","Yes. Robby, good question on the kind of some of the same-day fulfillment. We are really excited about what we continue to see there across pick-up, drive-up and Shipt. That was about three quarters of the digital growth was represented by same-day. It's a third of the business now and growing very, very quickly. So we are excited about that. Pick-up is nationwide and it has been nationwide for several years. Drive-up is very close to being nationwide. It will be largely done here as we get through the third quarter.","And your question about fresh is a good one. Something we are working hard on, piloting here in the Twin Cities and looking to understand the operational needs there a little bit more as we get through the back half of this year and then be back to tell you more about how we plan to scale that as we get into early next year. But I think when you put those three together, drive-up, pick-up and Shipt, we have got a great offering that our guest is clearly responding to. They are our cheapest fulfillment methods, so most profitable for Target. They are our fastest and we really see guest adoption taking off. So we are excited about the combination there.","Brian Cornell","And so, Robby, as we noted during our prepared remarks, same-day represents a third of our fulfillment and it's growing at a rate of 2X versus last year. And as we continue to build awareness through our marketing campaign, what we are doing from our in-store standpoint, our network standpoint as well as our digital communication to the guest, we are building awareness and we are seeing continued growth in that space. So we would expect those fulfillment channels, which obviously are our most profitable way to fill digital orders, to continue to grow over the balance of the year.","Robby Ohmes","And then I apologize if I missed it, but what number roughly your range should we be assuming for digital growth for the year out?","Brian Cornell","Robby, it's something that we do not provide guidance around. But what we have said for a number of years now is we expect to outgrow the overall industry by at least a rate of 2X. And as you have seen recently, we have been growing at three times the average rate of the digital growth in the industry.","Robby Ohmes","Great. Thanks so much.","Brian Cornell","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird. You may go ahead.","Peter Benedict","All right. Thanks guys. Maybe a question for John. Can you give us a little more color on the store operating model that was kind of rolled out here? Just curious, any more detail you can give us on how the operations are changing, either front-end or back-end? Just curious what you can add there?","John Mulligan","Yes. This is a journey the store team has been on for several years and really around raising our level of service in the stores. The biggest change around the actual operating model itself, historically, we kind of had a jack of all trades model. You would be a cashier day, go do price change, go do some planogram sets, whatever we needed you to do in general. Today, we have gotten far more specialized.","So people in the food area actually can speak about perishables. They are doing the ordering. They are responsible for that area. They are responsible for the out-of-stocks. Same for beauty. They can talk to our guests about beauty. They are in that area all day long. It's the only area they work in. They are responsible for the inventory that sits in the back room related to that area and keeping the floor full and interacting with our guests.","In apparel, more style, right. Visual merchandisings, people who can make the great products that the merchants are developing look great in the store. And in electronics, lots of product information. So a significantly higher level of expertise across the store in the categories where we need it.","And then across the rest of the store, places like essentials and some of the dry goods, just keep it full all day long. That's your job. Keep the store full. And so we are excited about actually implementing that across the chain this quarter. The teams continue to work through that. But the early results are very positive.","Peter Benedict","That's great. That's helpful. Thanks John. And then maybe for Mark, just there's been a number of own brand introductions over the last year or two, a very healthy pace. How do we think about that going forward? Does that continue? Or have you guys reached a point here where you have addressed the areas and you are going to just see how a lot of these kind of play out?","Mark Tritton","Yes, Peter. I think we addressed this last quarter as well. I mean, we expect the rate of change and newness to abate, but still sustain a level of newness to create interest for our guest. I think one of the things we are most buoyed by out of this quarterly performance is, we had a high degree of own brand launches, specifically in our home areas last year and we had really strong traffic and growth. Yet, we are anniversarying that yet another quarter. And I think it just goes to show the building blocks that these brands built to us in terms of preference for Target, but also how they create sustainable growth and long term value.","Brian Cornell","Yes. So, Peter, we will expect to see the rate of new brand introduction slow, but Mark and his team are very focused on bringing newness and innovation to the own brands that we have launched over the last couple of years. So we will continue to make sure those brands are on trend. We bring newness and freshness to those brands that have been successfully launched over the last couple of years. And Mark and his team are really excited about some of the innovation we will bring to those lines in 2020 and beyond.","Peter Benedict","Makes sense. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.","Greg Melich","Thanks. Really two areas I wanted to dig into a little bit. One is on tariffs. Just to clarify, it looks to us that for List 4 for you guys might be 80% of what you import or as you would have seen some experience from Lists 1 to 3. Is that the right sort of mix 80\/20 is to List 4 versus the first list? And then I had a follow-up on digital.","Brian Cornell","Greg, why don't we follow up with you offline. That number is overstated. We will circle back. But as we have said before, we have got a very balanced portfolio. Our sourcing teams have been working to diversify our network for a number of years now. But we will come back and try to address some of that offline.","Greg Melich","Okay. Fair enough. On the digital, I did want to understand a little bit more, just given the strength of the traffic about the nature of the customer. I see REDcard has been sort of flat, but are you getting a higher spend per trip from people using same-day? Is it existing customers coming more frequently? Are you finding new customers as a result of this?","Brian Cornell","Greg, one of the things that we have highlighted now for several quarters is the strength in our traffic growth. And Cathy talked about the fact that in this last quarter, it is a record high two-year stack for traffic growth. So we are seeing our Target guests visit us more frequently, shop more categories. They are enjoying the changes we have made in the store experience, but they are also taking advantage of the convenient fulfillment options that we are offering.","So as we look at the profile of our guests, they are still shopping our stores on a regular basis, but now we also give them the convenience of ordering online and picking up in their neighborhood store. In over, now 1,550 locations, they can place an order and pull into our parking lot. We have Shipt shoppers that will deliver within a couple of hours to their home.","So we are seeing traffic and interaction and engagement with our brand continue to grow and I think it's that wonderful combination of a great store experience and the suite of fulfillment capabilities that we are now offering that's driving greater engagement and greater traffic and visits to our stores and to our site.","Greg Melich","Great. Well, congrats on that and good luck for the back half.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. You may go ahead.","Chris Mandeville","Hi. Good morning. Just sticking with the digital conversation. Since you already referenced your performance versus expectations and gave us a little color right there from Greg's question, I guess I was just kind of curious about how same-day specifically is contributing to the comp? It was roughly, I think, 50% last quarter, now over 80%. Is there any way of breaking down the service modalities between pick-up, drive-up and Shipt and how they are contributing there? And then, Cathy, how did the service models in aggregate influence the margin in the quarter?","Brian Cornell","Well, I think we have said during the prepared comments that we are seeing honestly exceptional growth in our lower cost digital fulfillment options. And one of the things that John pointed out very clearly during our last Financial Community Conference is, as we shift our fulfillment from upstream DCs to our stores, we see our cost go down by upwards of 40%. When it moves to one of our same-day options, pick up in-store, drive-up or Shipt, we see a 90% reduction in that cost. So obviously, as we are seeing the acceleration of our same-day convenient options, more guests opting to order online and pick-up or use drive-up or Shipt, we are seeing the benefits of that flowing through our P&L.","Cathy Smith","Yes. So I was just going to add on, as we shared in the prepared remarks, we are seeing, because of that shift, almost half the pressure that we saw the same time a year ago on our gross margin. So we showed that 30 basis points of pressure for fulfillment and supply chain costs this quarter and that's almost half of what it was last year so we are seeing that movement and the adoption towards the same-day services are closer to the store.","Brian Cornell","I think it might be helpful if John go back and talk about some of things we are doing from a productivity standpoint and efficiency standpoint at the store level to make sure that as we fulfill those orders, we are driving even greater productivity and efficiency throughout our systems.","John Mulligan","Yes. I think the store teams have done an outstanding job of initially getting these services up and running and providing a great guest experience. That's the place to start always and that's what they did. I think since that time, as we have begun to roll, we have rolled these out and scaled them, the stores have done a great job going back, process reengineering, adding tools, adding technology to make all of it easier and faster for our teams.","And so we talked about just the pick for order pick-up and drive-up is 30% more productive this year than it was. Across the entirety of ship from store, it is 30% more productive than it was. And the stores we continue to work on additional ways to be more productive to add technology, potentially add some additional automation in the back of the house to help them become more productive.","So while we love the shift to the same-day experience, because that is net better economics, we are also working hard within each one of those services to optimize the unit economics and so great progress by our stores teams.","Brian Cornell","Operator, we have got time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question.","Brian Cornell","Good morning Michael.","Michael Lasser","Good morning Brian. Could you unpack the gross margin commentary about merchandising efforts to optimize cost, pricing, promotions and assortment? And the reason why is because I think there are questions about the sustainability of those factors. It does seem like you are expecting those to continue to drive benefit, given your commentary around gross margin in the third quarter.","Cathy Smith","Hi. I will start and Mark can add on to it. So first off, we had a terrific performance across the board by our team. So our merchant team from assortment to cost to price to promo, they managed the business throughout the entire quarter from the beginning of the quarter with Vineyard Vines through back-to-school, back-to-college with the cyber event in the middle. So amazing performance across the board. And by the way, we have got tremendous plans for Q3 and Q4 as well.","So I would tell you that they are sustainable type of efforts that we continue to do. And then we got a little bit of favorable mix with the strength of the apparel categories and little softening of the growth of toys and baby as we have now anniversaried the Toys \"R\" Us and Babies \"R\" Us exits. And so the combination of those gave us that really strong performance in gross margin this quarter.","Michael Lasser","Thank you for that.","Mark Tritton","Just to add, Michael, I mean, clearly our own brand strategy is working in the margin contribution as a benefit there. But I think that the agility and strength that Jill Sando and team brought to the apparel business in the quarter in terms of inventory management, markdown management and sales and share gains is definitely one of those strong contributors in our mix. But overall, everyone pulled weight and we had a great quarter.","Brian Cornell","So Michael, it's probably a good place for me to wrap up. And really complement Mark and his entire merchandising team for the work that they have done. We have been talking now for multiple years about the benefits of our multi-category portfolio. And I think we are seeing that play out each and every quarter. It was a couple of years ago where we were talking about the investments we made to be priced right daily. And our guest is responding to that and that's certainly flowing through in the gross margin.","So I think the exceptional work that the team has done to strengthen all facets of our portfolio, both our style and essential categories, the strength we are seeing across our multi-category portfolio, certainly, the market share gains we are seeing in important categories like apparel and combining that with the everyday value we are offering to our guests being priced right daily is contributing to the margin stability and improvement we are seeing in recent quarters.","So complements to Mark and the entire merchandising team for the work that they have done. But the guest is recognizing it and I think again it's contributing to the traffic gains we are seeing in our stores, the increased visits to our site and the flow-through that we are seeing throughout our P&L.","So it's a great way for us to wrap up this call. I appreciate everyone dialing in this morning and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. So thank you."],"20386":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call August 20, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","John Hulbert - Senior Director, Investor Communications","Brian Cornell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","John Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer","Kathee Tesija - Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","Analysts","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital","David Strasser - Janney","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Matt McClintock - Barclays","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 20, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Senior Director, Investor Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert - Senior Director, Investor Communications","Good morning and thank you for joining us on our 2014 second quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.","This morning, Brian will provide his initial impressions on joining Target and his priorities going forward, then Kathee will discuss results in the U.S and Canada and plans for the third quarter and beyond, and finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance, along with our financial outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his initial impressions of Target and his priorities going forward. Brian?","Brian Cornell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John. Before Kathee and John provide their perspective on Target\u2019s second quarter performance, I want to take a few minutes and discuss why I made the decision to come to Target and outline my priorities over the next few months. Even before I accepted the offer to lead this company, I have known and admired Target for multiple perspectives throughout my career. As a vendor partner, I have known Target as a smart, savvy, innovative, ethical and guest focused merchandiser. As a competitor, I have known Target as a disciplined, tough, focused retailer. A company that redefined the discount space by delivering outstanding design, world-class fashion, innovative products, at amazing prices.","As a guest, my family and I have known Target as unique place that makes shopping fun, saves us time and offers a differentiated experience based on newness and discovery. And finally, as a member of the community, I have known and admired Target for its commitment to making the places where we live and work better, both through its corporate giving programs and the commitment, the voluntarism from our team members. With my appointment as Chairman and CEO, I now have the opportunity to learn about Target from the inside and I could not be more thrilled to have the opportunity to lead this great company.","In the weeks and months ahead, I am planning to spend a great deal of my time listening to the team here in the U.S. and Canada in both our stores and headquarter locations, hearing directly from them about what\u2019s working and importantly what we need to change. In fact, I just got back from a visit to Canada, where I spent time with the team to get a firsthand update on their review of strategy and operations. While that review is not yet complete, based on what they have learned already, the Canadian team is making broad changes as they focused on improving performance in time for the key holiday season.","In the U.S., I have been spending time with John, Kathee and others on the leadership team to understand in detail our plans for the remainder of the year. In those discussions, I am ensuring that this team is focused on execution across every aspect of our business, particularly in the holiday season. In addition, I am deepening my understanding of Target\u2019s pipeline of omni-channel innovation and I am focused on our opportunities going forward. While I am very impressed with the progress the team has made recently, including innovations on our mobile platform, subscription service, Cartwheel and flexible fulfillment, we need to continue to move faster and grow faster than the marketplace. We need to build capabilities focused on satisfying the wants and the needs of our guest and ensuring that our digital and store operations operate seamlessly to provide a single superior experience.","Finally, I am working with the leadership team to begin detailed planning of next year\u2019s strategy and financial results. I am impressed with the progress that John and the team made in the last three months, including a strategy review that is the most comprehensive effort I have seen in my career. Their foundational work is providing me with a fresh fact-based perspective on Target\u2019s strengths and opportunities serving as the foundation for next year\u2019s plan and beyond.","Now, before I turn the call over to Kathee, I want to thank Roxanne Austin and John for their commitment to Target and to the team, which they demonstrated through their willingness to serve as Interim Chair and CEO over the last three months. In addition to the critical strategy work they initiated, Roxanne, John and the leadership team moved forward confidently to make important changes to internal processes, removing roadblocks, empowering teams and accelerating the pace of decision-making. While there is a lot of work ahead, I have been blown away by the passion and commitment displayed by team members across the country. This team is focused on winning in the marketplace by better serving our guests in both stores and digital channels. I look forward to working with this team to harness their passion and develop the appropriate strategies that position Target for success both today and over time.","Now, I will turn the call over to Kathee and John for review of the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Starting with Kathee who will provide detailed plan on our category performance, merchandising plans for the third quarter and beyond. Kathee?","Kathee Tesija - Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","Thanks, Brian. The second quarter marked a period of transition in both of our segments as the U.S. traffic trend improved over recent quarters and our monthly U.S. comps increased throughout the quarter. In Canada, Mark Schindele and the leadership team have been engaged in a comprehensive review of strategy and operations and are beginning to make changes to address their initial findings.","In our U.S. business, second quarter comparable sales were strongest in hard lines driven by both toys and electronics. Comparable sales were also positive in our less discretionary food, health and beauty categories, while they were down slightly in apparel and down low single-digit in home. In our digital channels, second quarter sales, including flexible fulfillment, grew most quickly in health and beauty hard lines and home. U.S. segment comparable transactions were down 1.3% completely offset by an increase in the average basket. While we are satisfied with the traffic decline, we are pleased that the U.S. traffic trend improved a full percentage point compared with the first quarter.","Our U.S. segment first quarter gross margin rate was down a full percentage point from last year driven by higher promotional intensity compared with the year ago. While the impact of promotions was a bit less than we experienced in the first quarter, it was more than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, reflecting a retail environment in which a broad set of competitors are leaning heavily on promotions and a consumer environment, in which shoppers are still cautious and focused on deals. However, while it\u2019s still early, we have been pleased with the results so far in the back-to-school and back-to-college season, in which we have seen improved sales trends from guests focused on the occasion rather than promotions.","Second quarter digital sales, including flexible fulfillment increased more than 30% over last year. This increase reflects a nearly 50% increase in visits to our mobile website, including iOS and Android apps, which more than offset a decline in visits to our conventional site. Importantly, conversion continues to improve rapidly on both our conventional site and mobile platforms driving a meaningful improvement in overall conversion despite the unfavorable mix shift between the migration to mobile.","To build on our momentum in digital, we have recently launched a new ad campaign focused on millennials that aims to expand the brand perception of Target from a brick-and-mortar destination to a total retailer experience. The campaign features three of our most prominent omni-channel initiatives, subscriptions, store pickup and Cartwheel. Market research indicates that these three solutions are among the most important to guests, because they help them save time, save money, and stay organized.","This year\u2019s back-to-college assortment includes a set of unique own brand items that our own product design and development team developed in partnership with college students based on the challenges they faced when living with roommates in very small spaces. And since we are already planning for back-to-college 2015, we have recently partnered with Betterific, an open crowd sourcing community focused on innovation to help us think of other innovative products that could make life in a first apartment or dorm room even better. The community proposed hundreds of ideas. Then together Target and the community built on each other\u2019s ideas and voted on the best ones. Now, our team is using the ideas to identify unmet guest needs, determine if there are products that we can bring to market for back-to-college next year and uncover completely new industry-first products. Betterific is part of Target\u2019s larger guest-to-guest initiative that is working to connect guests to each other and to Target in meaningful ways.","Our first TargetExpress store opened in late July here in the Twin Cities right next to the University of Minnesota campus. This store looks great and we are excited about the insights we will gain from operating this new format over time. At approximately 20,000 square feet, 15% of a typical general merchandise store, TargetExpress is designed, so guests can get what they need and get out quickly. So far sales at the store have come in as expected and not surprisingly we are seeing much more traffic and a much smaller basket than our chain wide average.","Also as expected, sales have been heavy in food and essentials with the mix of own brand sales in those categories far outpacing the chain average. We are also seeing strong sales in mobile electronics, including accessories and in our fan central area, where we feature University of Minnesota clothing. We plan to expand our test of this new format to several additional locations outside the Twin Cities next year.","Cartwheel just celebrated its first birthday and we celebrated with the crowd sourced Cartwheel offer, a first for Target for a special limited time discount. The winning offer generated a high level of engagement during the promotion period more than doubling the typical rate of new users and activations. Also in July, we launched a proof-of-concept to integrate Target.com into Cartwheel with the goal of making it simple for guests to shop with Cartwheel across channels. In this test, guests can see online eligible offers in their Cartwheel app and are directed to the Target.com mobile website to add them to their Target.com cart. After testing these initial deals, we will expand the number of offers and we will begin promoting the functionality when the testing period is complete.","In June, we meaningfully simplified the Target.com shopping experience by rolling out free shipping on all orders over $50. We made this change because the research shows that the number one cause of abandoned carts is a surprise at checkout, including uncertain shipping charges. Since we made this change, we have already seen measurable improvements in digital conversion rates and sales. Of course, I should mention that Target card guests continue to receive free shipping on every order everyday.","In late July, for the first time, we ran a promotion on our store pickup program with the goal of raising awareness of the service, while testing systems and processes before the fourth quarter peak. The guest response to the offer was far ahead of our expectations at five times the volume of a regular week with a particularly strong response in mobile. The offer attracted many guests to use store pickup for the first time and some are even new to Target.com. Importantly, about one-fifth of those guests engaged in additional shopping in-store when they picked up their online purchases.","We are pleased with continued strong growth in the number of guests spending up for Target subscriptions. Among the nearly 4,000 eligible items, subscription orders account for more than 15% of digital sales. In the back half of 2014, we are focused on enhancing the guest experience, including continued assortment expansion, consolidating shipments, simplifying communication and rightsizing packaging. We are also developing an optimized mobile experience and moving to test in-store acquisition via mobile devices and we are exploring gifting subscriptions, which would allow guests to register for subscriptions that are easy for gift givers to fulfill.","We are pleased with results from our second quarter test of ship from store capability in the Boston, Miami and Minneapolis markets. As part of the test, some guests were offered the option of a $10 service to get same day delivery on Target.com orders placed before 1:30 PM. In the three test markets, the ability to leverage our stores crossover inventory has allowed us to capture more sales by meaningfully improving digital in-stocks. In addition, shipping from a store dramatically reduces shipping times without the need to rely on air freight. This fall when we rollout standard ship from store capabilities to 35 additional markets, we will be within 1 to 2-day ground transit of 91% of the U.S. population.","In Canada, second quarter sales accelerated meaningfully from the first quarter but fell somewhat short of our expectations. Gross margin was also lower than expected driven by elevated markdowns resulting from continued operational issues. As I mentioned earlier, the Target Canada team is engaged in a comprehensive review of strategy and operations, which incorporates feedback from guests, teams and business partners and the team is taking decisive steps to address our guest concerns head-on, including changes to address in-stocks, pricing and assortment. To address in-stocks, the team is taking action on four dimensions, better reporting to identify in-stock issues sooner, retraining our teams on best methods, developing new best methods tailored to Canadian segment systems and reconfiguring systems to work more effectively over the long run.","On pricing, while both our own studies and external surveys show that we are already priced very competitively, the team has made decisive changes to ensure we respond even more quickly to pricing dynamics in the Canadian marketplace, including comparison shopping our prices versus competitors on more items more frequently, implementing enhanced tracking of competitor promotions to ensure we react quickly, and implementing a price match policy, which includes online and local competition with a more flexible process for guests.","Regarding the Canadian assortment, we are adding product lines that our guests told us were missing from our everyday lineup. We are adding more newness to our stores and we are adding more exclusive items and designer partnerships what we are known for in both the U.S. and Canada. Putting all these changes together means that of the 70,000 items in a typical Canadian Target store, about 30,000 items will be new between now and the holiday season. We believe these changes will position the Canadian segment for improved performance in time for this holiday season and the Canada leadership team will look for additional opportunities as they continue their review.","As we look ahead to the third quarter and beyond, we are excited about our plans to introduce new products, partnerships and capabilities in our stores and digital channels. We have been very pleased with early results from the back-to-school season, including the response to buy one, give one offers on our own up and up supplies, along with our exclusive line of colorful notebooks, pens and rulers from UB. Like our back-to-college assortment, many up and up back-to-college products were developed by our own design team in partnership with students and teachers who tested them and gave us report cards on how they could be improved. The guest response to the up and up school assortment has been phenomenal. Last year, comp sales in up and up school supplies were up more than 25% during the back-to-school season and we are planning another healthy increase this year.","Our back-to-college assortment highlights mix and match options for guys and gals to outfit their entire dorm in a stylish and affordable way. Some of our guest favorites are space saving, multiuse items like a storage mirror, a task lamp with iPhone and iPad storage, multifunctional and collapsible tables and desks, and innovative storage solutions designed to go over the bed or chair to hold laptops and mobile phones. This year\u2019s addition of registry capability for college students has been outpacing expectations. On average, a student registers for 30 items totaling more than $1,000.","We are excited about our upcoming designer partnership, Altuzarra for Target, which will arrive on September 14. Designer and creative director, Joseph Altuzarra created a limited edition fall collection of women\u2019s ready-to-wear lingerie, accessories, and shoes, which will be available at most Target stores in the U.S. and Canada as well as Target.com. In addition, an edited assortment of the collection will be available globally at Net-A-Porter.com.","In May 2013, Target entered into a partnership with Sam & Libby and it\u2019s been a huge hit with our guests who love classic styles like the original leather boat ballet at an unexpected value of $30. In September, we will be extending our Sam & Libby assortment with the launch of the exclusive Sam & Libby handbag line in over 1,000 stores throughout the U.S., with two fall collections featuring 20 styles in stores as an extended assortment on Target.com.","In women\u2019s apparel, the fall assortment will reflect the number one current trend we call neo-traditional with feminine menswear inspired looks in plaids and florals. This look will be most visible in Merona with hints in of our Xhilaration and Mossimo Supply Company lines. After rapid growth in 2013, we are expecting another big increase this fall in women\u2019s boots, including riding boots from Merona and lace-up ankle boots from Mossimo Supply Company.","Another hot trend is sport and this fall we will be riding the leisure trend in our juniors\u2019 assortment with leggings, sweatshirts, yoga pants, joggers and fashion athletic shoes. In denim, a huge category for back-to-college, we just launched a new improved shopping experience for our guests with improved navigation, new fits, a broader range of sizes, more stretch, and the most relevant washes and styling, all highlighted through compelling promotions.","In threshold, the fall season is all about natural materials, beautiful textures and warm metallics. With key solutions in entertaining, like our warm metallic bar cart, accessories, glassware and flatware and decorative items like lanterns, throws, toss pillows and perfect accent tables. In July, Target launched S Sport designed by Skechers partnering with one of the hottest footwear brands in the industry today. The S Sport label is a lifestyle brand targeted to appeal to the entire family with offerings in kids, men\u2019s and women\u2019s. The initial response has been overwhelming and we have seen styles performing at 4 to 8 times the average of our shoe category. S Sport shoes for men, women and children are available at all U.S. and Canadian stores and at Target.com ranging in price from $25 to $40.","In housewares in September, we will be featuring new products from some of the hottest national brands and small appliances with the introduction of the VertuoLine from Nespresso, single-serve blenders from Vitamix, and the new Keurig 2.0 line. In June, Target teamed up with the Honest Company to offer guests non-toxic eco-friendly products by co-designers, Jessica Alba and Christopher Gavigan featuring diapers, biodegradable wipes, organic bath and skincare and an expanded assortment on Target.com.","Based on the success of the collaboration, we recently expanded our Honest Company assortment to include a line of all-natural cleaning supplies. Like Honest Company, our Made to Matter collection was inspired by our guest desire for better for you natural and organic products. This unique collection differentiates Target in the marketplace and provides vendor partners a stage to innovate in support of their leadership positions in respective categories. The collection launched in April with an initial set of items and the guest response has been outstanding. So, we are excited about the upcoming launch in September of an expanded assortment of more than 100 Made to Matter products, including exclusive new to market items from Method, Seventh Generation and many others.","At CHEFS Catalog, which just celebrated its 35th anniversary, we are excited about our upcoming October collaboration with CHEFS and longtime host of Bizarre Foods, Andrew Zimmern. The partnership includes several products, which melds the design elements of Japanese, Chinese and French cutlery into items Andrew describes as one knife fits all pieces of kitchen magic. The collaboration also features spice blends with names like Flex Your Mex, Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, or Grill Buddy.","For Halloween, we are excited to be partnering once again with designer Chris March to offer a whimsical wig and accessory collection. This unique assortment reinforces both sides of our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise, with wigs that look like curlers or lobsters and the core items from candy bowls to hand towels, all priced at $20 or less. The collection available exclusively at Target stores in the U.S. and Canada and at Target.com will launch mid-September online and later that month in our stores.","In Canada, we just announced that we have extended our very successful beaver canoe collaboration with an expansion of home decor items, along with men\u2019s and women\u2019s sleepwear and slippers. Also in Canada, on September 7, we will be launching two new lines of cleaning products, Better Life, an all-natural line of cleaning products designed by two fathers with charismatic packaging designed to speak to younger generations and Ecover, a European brand recently merged with Method, which will re-launch with better formulations and modernized packaging.","Increasingly, consumers expect everything they do to be personalized and this is particularly true of millennials, Target\u2019s fastest growing guest segment. For the last six months, Target.com has been building an engine that will enable personalization across all of Target\u2019s selling channels. Personalized product recommendations, the first iteration of this work will launch this fall at Target.com. When a guest shops our site, we will suggest products based on their store and digital purchase and browse history. This presents a significant opportunity to ensure guests see the products and offers most relevant to them both in-store and online and in turn generate additional sales.","We will continue improving the guest experience and we are working to extend the personalization to more guest experiences, including product content and offers in the future. We also continue to add mobile enhancements to drive additional traffic and conversion. Just today, we launched a new header to enhance navigation and the mobile landing page and we are streamlining mobile checkout to two clicks.","Also this year, we are overhauling our registry service with the new best-in-class experience that combines the power of online and mobile shopping together with in-store tools like new web-enabled smart scanners and iPad kiosks. Registry is already important for Target and the new experience puts us at the forefront of the industry by making the entire process easier, smarter and faster. Improvements include faster scanning and adding of products, easy addition of companion products, full product information, access to reviews and inspiration through collections and lists. And in our stores, we are pleased with results from our efforts to refresh the shopping experience in key categories, including baby, apparel and beauty.","In July, we added another 167 stores with the enhanced baby layout bringing the total number to more than 200. In apparel, we have about 50 stores today with an enhanced presentation, including manikins, and we are planning to expand this layout to another 600 stores by October. And in beauty, we continue to see strong results from this year\u2019s refresh of displays throughout the U.S. while featuring beauty concierge service in more than 400 stores. We are excited with our plans for the fall and believe we are taking the right steps to improve results in both the U.S. and Canada and we are encouraged that based on the changes we are making we have seen positive comps over the last six weeks in the U.S. We are working hard to ensure that teams in both countries are focused on execution during the upcoming holiday season and we look forward to working with Brian to map our vision for Target\u2019s future.","Now, I will turn it over to John who will share his insights on the second quarter financial performance and our third quarter and full year outlook. John?","John Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Kathee. As I mentioned in today\u2019s press release, we are not satisfied with our second quarter results, but we are seeing early signs of progress. In the U.S., our second quarter traffic was notably better than the first quarter pace, enough to improve the traffic trends on a two-year basis. However, the level of second quarter promotions in the U.S. remained elevated.","And looking ahead, we are working to moderate our promotional intensity to a level we believe is more appropriate in the long run. We are encouraged with the recently improved U.S. comparable sales trend. In particular, because our promotional intensity over this period was not as elevated as earlier in the year. In Canada, the team has been working hard to assess root causes for underperformance and implement changes to improve operations and the product assortment with the focus on improving results in time for the holiday season. However, we want to be clear that current financial performance in Canada remains unacceptable.","Our second quarter comp in the U.S. segment was flat largely in line with our guidance. As Kathee mentioned, digital sales, including flexible fulfillment, grew more than 30% compared with last year contributing about 60 basis points to comparable sales. While this demonstrates meaningful progress on our omni-channel journey, we will continue to invest in digital capabilities as the importance of this channel continues to grow.","Our second quarter U.S. segment EBITDA margin was lower than expected, about 80 basis points below last year driven by a lower than expected gross margin rate partially offset by better than expected SG&A expenses. Specifically, the U.S. segment gross margin rate was down about 100 basis points from last year somewhat better than our first quarter experience, but not where we expect to perform over the longer term. The U.S. segment\u2019s second quarter SG&A rate improved about 20 basis points versus last year, reflecting impressive discipline across the organization combined with the benefit of our expense optimization efforts.","In the U.S., second quarter sales penetration on REDcards was 28.8%, up more than two percentage points over last year. As I mentioned on the last call, we have seen a slower trend in debit card applications since the data breach, which is leading to slower growth in sales penetration. We have taken steps to reaccelerate growth in REDcard applications, including increased activity in our stores and we have begun to see improvement in REDcard issuance as a result, particularly in the last few weeks. However, given there is a lagged impact of applications on penetration, we expect penetration growth will continue to moderate in the third and fourth quarter, reflecting the slowdown in new REDcard accounts we have seen so far this year. Specifically, our current expectation is that U.S. REDcard penetration growth will be in the range of flat to up 1% in the third quarter and will reach a trough at around flat in the fourth quarter before reaccelerating into next year.","In the Canadian segment, second quarter sales were 63% higher than last year and about 14% above for the first quarter. For the first time, we began reporting comparable sales in Canada this quarter as 48 stores became mature at various points within the quarter. However, this metric is expected to be very noisy initially due to the strong and longer than normal grand opening sales surges we saw last year and the fact that we densified around these initial openers later in 2013. As a result, this quarter the Canadian comp was down more than 11%, reflecting these impacts and less than adequate progress in our efforts to grow sales in these stores.","On our Canadian sales, we are under gross margin rate of just over 18% in the second quarter, well below where we should operate in the long run. Both sales and gross margin rate continued to reflect operations that are not working optimally resulting in lumpy inventory. We continue to see inconsistent in-stock levels by item and location and we have excess inventory overall leading to elevated levels of clearance markdowns. This is why the Canadian leadership team has put its highest priority on implementing system and process changes designed to improve operations with the goal of improving performance in time for the holiday season.","And as Kathee outlined, the team is already making a host of changes based on findings from our operational review. Second quarter Canadian segment expense rates were better than last year, reflecting the startup nature of results a year ago. However, these rates will remain elevated until we gain more scale in this segment. REDcard penetration in Canada was 4.8% in the second quarter, more than double last year\u2019s 2.3% as Canadian guests continue to respond to the value these cards provide. We expect to continue to see robust growth in penetration for quite sometime.","Beyond the operating results in the U.S. and Canada, our second quarter GAAP EPS reflected the impact of several items, not included in adjusted EPS. The largest adjustment was a $0.27 per share charge for the accounting loss associated with our second quarter early debt retirement. We funded this retirement along with a $1 billion maturity with the issuance of $2 billion of debt at very favorable rates in the quarter. Not reflected in this accounting loss is the fact that the early debt retirement has a positive net present value. Also in the quarter, we recognized data breach expenses of $148 million partially offset by the recognition of a $38 million insurance receivable.","In addition to legal, consulting and administrative fees, second quarter breach expenses included an additional accrual for estimated probable losses for what we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach-related claims, including claims by payment card networks for fraud and administrative costs. This means that in total over the last few quarters, we have recognized an accumulated $236 million of gross expenses related to the breach offset by a $90 million insurance receivable for a net of $146 million. This number is dramatically lower than many external estimates at the time of the breach and it reflects the benefits of our efforts to rapidly notify both card networks and our guests when we learned of the breach enhancing the effectiveness of fraud prevention and detection.","Looking ahead, we will continue to incur legal, consulting and administrative costs related to the breach, but we don\u2019t expect those costs to be material in any period. And of course, it will take more time to resolve all breach-related claims. And while we don\u2019t believe it is probable, it is possible that we could incur material losses beyond the amounts we have already accrued. Beyond these two larger adjustments in the second quarter, we also recognized $0.01 each related to the impairment of some undeveloped land and the continued reduction in the beneficial interest asset associated with last year\u2019s credit card portfolio sales.","Turning to the consolidated metrics, second quarter interest expense was $282 million higher than last year due entirely to the loss on early debt retirement I covered earlier. We also paid $272 million in dividends this quarter, up 18% from $231 million last year. As expected, the Board approved a quarterly dividend increase during the quarter raising a 21% from $0.43 to $0.52. This increase builds on our company\u2019s track record of annual dividend increases, which have occurred every year since 1971.","Beyond the non-cash share settlement forward contracts related to our deferred compensation plans, we did not engage in any share repurchase in the second quarter and we don\u2019t expect to do so in the third quarter as well. While we continue to expect to return robust amounts of cash to share repurchase over time, our business performance is not where it needs to be to sustain our middle A credit ratings. As I have said previously, to resume share repurchase, two things need to happen. First, we need to have sufficient visibility into our potential liability for claims related to the data breach and second, we need to see sufficient improvement in our U.S. and Canadian operations to create a clear path for our credit metrics to return to acceptable levels in support of our single A rating. While this quarter\u2019s recognition of an additional breach related accrual reflects progress on the first condition, our current and expected operating performance does not meet the second. As a result, we expect to continue to suspend cash investments in share purchase until operating performance improves.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full year. As I mentioned last quarter, in light of the environment and our performance so far this year, we will continue to maintain a cautious outlook for sales in both segments allowing us to plan inventory and expenses flexibly while maintaining contingency plans to flex higher when sales grow faster than expected. One note, consistent with guidance last quarter, our outlook does not include potential additional costs related to the data breach beyond what we have already recognized as they are not estimable.","With that, let\u2019s turn to our third quarter expectations. We are currently forecasting U.S. comparable sales will be flat to up 1% this quarter. And as Kathee mentioned, we are encouraged by the positive comps we have seen so far in August. On our sales, we expect to see an EBITDA margin rate of 8% or a bit better. This rate reflects continued expected pressure on the gross margin line, but we expect about half the pressure we experienced in the second quarter. Consistent with earlier in the year, our third quarter EBITDA performance will benefit from our ongoing expense optimization efforts.","In Canada, we expect sales growth of more than 50% above last year and more than 10% from the second quarter. This growth would lead to an expected positive single-digit comparable sales growth rate. EBITDA and EBIT margin rates are expected to improve compared with last year and be in line with or slightly better than the rates we saw in the second quarter. Altogether, these expectations would improve third quarter Canadian segment EBITDA by approximately $25 million compared with last year.","We expect third quarter consolidated interest expense to be approximately flat for last year and tax expense to be somewhat lower. Altogether, these expectations would generate adjusted EPS, reflecting results from both our U.S. and Canadian operations of $0.40 to $0.50, excluding $0.02 related to the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any potential cost related to the data breach, which are not expected to be material.","For the full year, we now expect U.S. comparable sales in the range of flat to up 1%. In the U.S., we continue to expect an SG&A expense rate of about 20% for the full year and a gross margin rate between 29% and 30%. These expectations reflect year-to-date results along with anticipated year-over-year favorability in fourth quarter gross margin and SG&A expense rates as we annualized the impacts of the data breach in fourth quarter 2013.","In our Canadian segment, we continue to expect full year sales of about $2 billion. However, given our recent experience and moderated expectations for gross margin in the near-term, we now expect an EBITDA margin rate near minus 25% for the full year. Altogether, these updated expectations would put our full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.10 to $3.30 below the range we provided a quarter ago. These expected results are clearly not where we expect to perform over time. Over the last 90 days, Kathee and I have worked with a leadership team to take visible steps to continue healing our U.S. business by removing unnecessary bureaucracy to speed up decision-making, devoting resources to drive increased newness and innovation in our merchandise assortments and store presentation, and investing in our digital transformation.","While there is a lot more work to do, I am encouraged with our quarter-over-quarter improvement in U.S. traffic and our sales experience so far in July and August, particularly because this improvement has not been driven by intense promotions. In Canada, Mark and the team are making meaningful changes to operations, pricing and assortment as they focus on improving performance in the upcoming holiday season.","Finally, as Brian mentioned earlier, over the last three months, partnership with Interim Chair, Roxanne Austin. The leadership team has conducted an in-depth review of our strategy, our brand, our guest and our capabilities in both the U.S. and Canada. Since Brian arrived, we have spent a great deal of time with him sharing insights from this review. And we believe this work will provide the foundation from which we can build a longer term vision for our strategy and financial model. We are so excited to welcome Brian to the team and committed to working with him to move this company forward. And like Brian, we believe the best days for Target lie ahead.","With that, we will conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks. Now, Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Wayne Hood with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital","Good morning, Brian and everyone. Brian, I had a question for you and then one for Kathee, when you arrived, the role of President was left open. And I was curious whether or not you anticipate filling that role and any organizational structures that you might contemplate to speed the company to getting to market? And then Kathee, if you could just peel back the onion around why the UPT was down 1.7%, you made good progress in transactions, but you took a step back in UPT. And I am just wondering why and what you expect for those metrics into the third and fourth quarter? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Wayne, let me start by answering your first question. My focus right now is to really understand the business in both the U.S. and Canada and I am spending a lot of time with John and Kathee and the team to understand the guest perspective on Target, how we improve our traffic, how we enhance our performance in Canada, and how we continue to build-out and rapidly build-out our omni-channel capabilities. So, I am very focused on making sure that we are going to make progress against those key three initiatives as I continue to look at the broader and longer term strategic options. So, my focus is really understanding the business today and strategy before we have any discussions around organization modifications going forward.","Kathee Tesija","And then Wayne in terms of unit per transaction, most of that was driven by higher dollar items that we were selling, things in electronics and in entertainment, so you see the healthy selling prices you mentioned, but fewer units. On the other portion of that, that I would say is that we are seeing really good momentum in our trade-up strategies. So, we are selling in some cases fewer units, but higher price points in other categories across the company, but it\u2019s predominantly electronics and entertainment.","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Strasser with Janney. Please go ahead.","David Strasser - Janney","Thank you very much. I just wanted to step back a little bit and look you talked about even gross margins for this year to 29% to 30% range is a pretty wide range. And as you think about a world, an e-commerce world and how things are changing fairly rapidly out there. I am just trying to get a sense if you think over time that the gross margins are within that range, lower end of that range and sort of how you are thinking about that competitive landscape. I mean, you talked a lot about a lot of new merchandising initiatives and stuff, which can help offset some of that, but at the same time as every company that we have seen kind of get more focused and driven around e-commerce seems to see their gross margins lower by the nature of what that business is. So, I would love to hear a little bit about your thought process there? Thank you.","Kathee Tesija","Yes, David, there is no doubt with e-commerce being as immature as it is. There is some pressure on gross margin. We are committed to going where our guests go and they want to be able to shop online and we are going to make sure that we have got all the right products for them both online and in our stores. So that does give us a little headwind on the gross margin, but as you pointed out, all of the newness that we are bringing in, the things that our guests love most about Target that helps to offset it. So, we don\u2019t have a number to share with you today, but we are very focused on driving sales, going where the guest is and offering them those products that delight them.","David Strasser - Janney","So, I mean, I guess just as a follow-up to that, I mean, if the guest does go more rapidly towards .com, are you willing to accept lower gross margins to do that? And then just I guess sort of a related question to that too as you know, you talked about opening stores for greater hours, is there an SG&A investment as well that would be related to e-com \u2013 aside from just the build-out of e-commerce that you think that you need to add to the stores once again as this world is shifting? Thank you very much.","John Mulligan","On the gross margin rate, I think Kathee said it really well. We are going to go where the guest is and meet them, provide the product they want, where they want it, when they want it, how they want it, but there is a lot of tools in our toolkit to manage gross margin rate. There is certainly the product that Kathee talked about emphasizing the style categories with newness and differentiation. Beyond that there is the flexible fulfillment options, where we lowered shipping expense by moving the product closer to our guests and also ultimately balancing inventories better across the entire network and reducing markdowns that we incur today. So, there are lots of puts and takes. And like Kathee said, we don\u2019t have it all sorted out today. We will provide more information as we do, but I think there are lots of puts and takes as we think about gross margin rate more broadly.","On the store, hourly payroll, first on the extended hours, the investment there was immaterial to the quarter. Again, that was about half the stores adding one hour of operation, so not significant investment there, but with Tina Schiel, our Head of Stores, we continually talk about ensuring that we are striking the right balance between productivity in those stores and we are having great guest service results. And what we see today, our guest surveys, of course, are as high as they have ever been and the team continues to drive really strong expense control. So, we feel good about where we are today, but we constantly evaluate that.","David Strasser - Janney","Thank you very much. I appreciate the answers.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot. Good morning. Brian, I would like to start out by asking you for your long-term perspective of threshold for Canada is related to time and financial performance, obviously that business today is performing at a materially lower level than was originally conceived when it was opened and presumably well below it\u2019s cost of capital. What would you want to see over time to keep that business running and what kind of timeframe do you have in mind for a same material improvement in that business?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Well, Matthew as I mentioned earlier, I spent time just last week with the Canadian team and I am certainly aware that the expansion has been challenging. And from a Target standpoint, we have disappointed many of our Canadian guests. And Kathee has already referenced the fact that we are conducting an in-depth evaluation of our Canadian business that began several months ago. And we are certainly looking to make material improvements in that business. Right now, short-term, the focus is on improving in-stock conditions, our pricing and assortment and really ensuring that we have got plans in place to improve our performance in the holiday upcoming. So, you can expect me to be spending quite a bit of time with the Canadian team along with Kathee to make sure we understand the opportunities, we understand the challenges that we have to address, and we are focused on improving in-stocks, our value position, and an assortment as we go forward. So, I am going to spend clearly the balance of the year working very closely with that team to make sure we have got plans in place to improve performance as we go into the holiday season.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up on the U.S. business in the market for buy online, pickup in stores more mature, how additive do you find that is either to online sales or to the business overall? I know that for some retailers, it can be as much as 30% or 40% of the overall online sales number. So, where you have seen \u2013 where you have the most track record behind if you will what\u2019s your sense of how additive that can be?","Kathee Tesija","Well, we did add it to the chain all at the same time. So, we don\u2019t have any markets that are more mature. We did do a little testing with the team members in Minneapolis before we rolled that, but basically we rolled it all around November 1 of last year to all stores. And we have been very pleased with the results from buy online, pickup in store and about 14% of our digital sales today are being picked up in-store and then when they go to store to pickup those orders, we are seeing about 20% of those guests shop in the store to pickup additional items and there is a very healthy basket with that as well, so still early, but very, very promising. We think it saves guest time, it saves them money, and it allows them to consolidate their shopping.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for that clarity.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Hi, thanks. John, I want to follow-up a bit on the gross margins down 100 bps in the quarter, if I remember correctly, you had a goal for $600 million of cost reduction this year, roughly a third of it in cost of goods sold. Could you give us an update as to where we are on that and how much that may have helped the quarter in terms of U.S. margins?","John Mulligan","Yes, sure. You are right. It was \u2013 the goal for expense optimization about $650 million incremental to last year, which gets us to $850 million in total. Of the $650 million this year, just rough numbers, about $200 million of that was on the gross margin line coming out of cost of goods, more of that back-weighted than front-weighted. We are probably about a little bit more than a third of the way through that, probably a little bit more than that, maybe half of the way through that. So, there was definitely some benefit in the quarter from expense optimization. That was also true in the first quarter. Both quarters have benefited, but later in the year, we will see more benefit as we continue to grow those savings.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","And the same with the SG&A out of that $650 million, it\u2019s more back end?","John Mulligan","Yes, it builds as the year goes on. We are annualizing on the roughly $200 million we saved last year. That was primarily SG&A. So, there is probably a little bit more good news in SG&A right now, but that will continue to build as well as we go throughout the year.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Great. And if I could Brian, thanks a lot and welcome back to retail.","Brian Cornell","Thank you, Greg.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","For your opening comments, how long do you think it will take for you to sort of get to understand the business in the customers and actually come up with a plan, is it something we should expect by year end or early next year or can you give us any time horizon on that?","Brian Cornell","Well, Greg, I am going to quickly immerse myself in the details of the business, both here in the U.S. and Canada. And John and Kathee and the leadership team have already spent hours with me walking through a lot of the strategic work that they have been doing over the last 90 days. As I said earlier, during my very first week, I visited the Canadian market to spend time with that team. And I want to be a good student of the business, but clearly we have to have a sense of urgency here and a sense of pace. And while I want to study the business and certainly and listen and learn from our team, no one is happy with our current performance. And our focus right now is to make sure we have got plans in place in the short-term to improve traffic, we have got plans in place to improve our performance in Canada, and we have got to continue to move faster from a digital and mobile standpoint to meet the needs of our guest. So, you can expect a clear sense of urgency, but I certainly want to make sure I give myself the time to listen, learn, understand, the business both from our team standpoint, but also from the eyes of the target guest. And you can expect me to dive in very quickly to understand the business, to look for the opportunities and to work with the leadership team to develop very focused priorities as we go forward into 2015 and beyond.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Thanks a lot.","Brian Cornell","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks a lot and good morning. I was hoping to get some more detail on the improved performance in July and August. And I am wondering if you have a sense from your guest surveys, how much of that change is driven by price investments efforts to improve the presentation or it maybe a change in the broader environment?","Kathee Tesija","Yes. Matt, I think it\u2019s more about product and the newness that we have on the floor. For back-to-school, back-to-college, we have seen both of those start off really strong. Even in their peak weeks, those stores are doing better that week after their peak. So, we are seeing it stronger in the peak and then get even stronger after that. So, I think it\u2019s really product-related and newness. Certainly, we have had promotions. Most of them are devoted to those core categories like apparel, some of the back-to-college items, but the guest right now is more focused on the occasion than they are under the promotion. So, that is very encouraging to us and I think its product driven.","Brian Cornell","Matt, if I could just early days, but the current performance on back-to-school and the way Kathee and the team, have put back-to-school together at Target has been very impressive to me. And I think it\u2019s a great example of getting the product right, the right balance of newness and innovation, great advertising communication that really captures the guest attention and very strong in-store and online execution. So, I think that\u2019s one of the great examples that we are going to continue to build from as we go forward, but I think Kathee and the entire team have brought back-to-school to life, back-to-college to life with the right products, the right newness and innovation, great advertising communication to support it, and then very strong in-store and online execution.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","That\u2019s very helpful. And then one housekeeping follow-up if I may, your Canada comp transactions were only down about 2%, which frankly was a little bit surprising against the grand opening halo, I am wondering why UPT was down so much, I think it was down over 8%?","John Mulligan","UPT down 8% in Canada, Matt, I think a lot of that \u2013 what I would tell you is a lot of noise going on in the Canada comp overall. So much of the surge last year we saw very different types of transactions, then we saw once we moved past that as we opened stores, we saw that in each cycle, very different behavior for those I don\u2019t know four to six weeks when we had the surge period. And then as the business settled down and got into a more normal state, we saw more routine transaction counts and baskets. What I would tell you is we are going to continue to see this. It\u2019s going to be noisy in Q3. And really it won\u2019t be till we get to Q4 when we have cycled past all the opening cycles, all the densification that we get a real read on what\u2019s going on, on a comparable basis from the business year-over-year.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thanks so much and good luck.","John Mulligan","Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matt McClintock - Barclays","Hi, yes, good morning and welcome Brian.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Matt.","Matt McClintock - Barclays","Kathee, my question was actually for you, you talk a lot about product freshness and newness and I was just wondering as you look to the fall merchandise plan, how far can you push freshness and newness into that plan? What inning would you say that represents overall relative to what you consider to be more optimal level and when can we realistically expect you to reach that more optimal level? Thank you.","Kathee Tesija","Well, haven\u2019t thought about it in terms of innings, Matt, but we are excited about what we have coming for the fall season. I highlighted a lot of things that are coming in September and October, but then moving on to the fourth quarter, which we won\u2019t be specific about today, but we are excited about what that brings as well. We have about 85,000 items in our assortment and we will have 35,000 new items this fall season. So, I do feel pretty optimistic about the contents, the quality, the trend, the presentation, but clearly, in spring I think you will see that will be a full cycle out and we will have much more to come as we turned the corner into the spring season.","Matt McClintock - Barclays","Thank you.","John Hulbert","Matt, thank you. Operator, I think we have got time for one last question.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning and welcome Brian. Quick one for Kathee, we talked in New York about a month ago about traffic trips and I understand we are still intact from the customer, but you had lost 1 out of 10 and that maybe e-commerce was the angle of you to get that back. My question is how confident and I don\u2019t know if you have any early indications from your own data that when that customer does shop online with you that either they are not going to visit the store less or that they will not maintain the same level of purchasing?","Kathee Tesija","Yes. The guest that shops Target online is absolutely our best guest. They shop both online and in-stores. It\u2019s really all about what\u2019s convenient for them and sometimes it\u2019s just easier to knocking item off your list by buying it on your mobile device. Sometimes, you want to purchase it online by pick it up in store to do the rest, but this is absolutely our best guest and one we will not see. So, we will go after being a seamless omni-channel retailer with confidence knowing that it\u2019s the best thing for our guest and best thing for our business. And I do think that, that when we think about the last guest, they are basically backed and so traffic changes are more about consolidated trips and trips shifting online. So, it\u2019s an important part for us to own it, which is why you see all of the efforts in our omni-channel capabilities and strategies with subscriptions and with personalization and with ship from store and buy online, pickup in stores, there is a lot of things that we are putting effort into that will help drive that momentum.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","John Hulbert - Senior Director, Investor Communications","Right.

Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS from continuing operations and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations Web site.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the first quarter and our priorities going forward. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. At our financial community meeting, in February, we outlined our multi-year plan to position Target to deliver consistent growth, market share gains and outstanding financial performance over the long-term. This plan includes capital investments of more than $7 billion over the next three years, focused on continued investments in technology and our supply chain to build a smart network; a network that leverages all of our store and distribution assets to serve our guests more quickly and flexibly in every channel.","Investments to re-imagine the shopping experience in more than 600 of our existing stores and the addition of more than 100 new small format locations around the country. On top of these capital investments, we discussed our plan to invest $1 billion of operating margin this year to allow us to move faster and support of our strategic priorities. We said our biggest operating investment will be in our team, equipping them to deliver enhanced service, convenience and deeper product expertise; as we prepare for the launch of 12 new and exciting brands over the next two years.","Beyond these expense investments, we outline our expectation for gross margin pressure, resulting from the continued rapid increase in digital fulfillment combined with the price investments to support our everyday value proposition in key categories. Among all the things we covered in detailed at the meeting, one message I don't believe we emphasize enough, is our continued commitments to strong execution, everyday and every part of our business.","While we certainly need to focus intently on delivering our long-term commitments, we need to maintain an equal focus on maximizing the performance of our business every day, both in store and online, delivering for our guests and our shareholders. So I want to thank our team for very strong execution in the first quarter in a very choppy environment. They delivered sales and profitability that was meaningfully better than our expectations.","In February, we provided first quarter and full year guidance. We emphasize that our goal is to plan prudently and prepare to chase business when the opportunity arises. And that's exactly what happened in the first quarter, following very soft trends in late-January and into February, we saw an acceleration beginning in late February which was offset by better than expected sales in March and April. While our comp sales were strongest in April, if we adjust for the Easter shift, we saw our best results in March.","While we were pleased that our first quarter financial performance was better than expectations, our results are not where we want them to be, and we have much more work to do. Week-to-week results have been volatile since Christmas and overall traffic declined nearly 1% in the first quarter. Along with this traffic decline, comp sales in both essentials and food and beverages were down as well. As we've mentioned in previous calls, we believe that consumer perception of value at Target have not reflected how well or out-the-door prices really are. As a result, we\u2019re in the early stages of implementing merchandising and marketing efforts to improve Target's value perception with guests and reestablish everyday price credibility on key items.","As we implement those changes, we plan to measure carefully and adjust based on how guest respond. To support these efforts in our marketing, late in first quarter, we launched a new ad campaign focused on our convenient and low price assortment of everyday items. Reminding guests they can save time and money by making a Target run to their nearby store. And for guest that prefer to get their essentials at home, we recently announced that we're testing Target Restock, which will allow guests to order a large box filled with items they choose from a selection of thousands of essential items. We've been testing this service for team members here in the Twin Cities and we're preparing to extend this test to local Red Card holders in the near future. While some specifics to the offer have yet to be finalized, we expect to have a very competitive service compared with alternatives that are already in the marketplace.","Beyond essentials, we are focused on growing the signature portion of our business and we continue to be pleased with the performance of Cat & Jack and Pillowfort, the new apparel and home brands we launched for the kids last year.","Based on our insights from last year's launches, Mark and his team are preparing to rollout additional brands later in the year as part of our plan to launch 12 new brands across our signature categories over the next two years.","Beyond these efforts to re-imagine our exclusive brand portfolio, we continue to find new opportunities to partner with world class designers and brands and deliver unique style and unbeatable value for our guests. In the first quarter, we were pleased with the results from our limited time partnership with Victoria Beckham, which proved to be one of the single biggest partnerships in our history.","In the digital channel, sales increased 22% in the first quarter, much faster than the growth rate of the industry. Mike McNamara and his team continue to work closely with both John\u2019s team and Mark\u2019s team to develop and roll out new capabilities, highlight our differentiated assortment and elevate the guest experience by providing more speed and convenience.","We invested nearly $500 million of capital in the first quarter and we\u2019re on track to invest more than $2 billion this year. Our technology and supply chain investments are focused on delivering a superior guest experience in every channel. In addition to new capabilities like Target Restock, we provide convenience we\u2019re working to deliver a more inspirational digital experience, like the 360 degree shopping experience we just launched on our site.","This capability was delivered by our CGI team and we\u2019re investing to grow that team so we can rapidly roll-out additional experiences overtime. Beyond our continued investments in technology and supply chain, we\u2019re in the early stages of work to transform our existing store base and add to our portfolio of new small format stores around the country.","In the first quarter, we completed 21 existing store remodels and opened four new small format locations. For the year, we\u2019re on track to deliver our goal to complete 100 remodels and add 30 small format stores. I personally visited many of these locations and the results look terrific. As we described in February, we are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates robust cash flow.","Unlike many competitors, we have the resource to allow us to invest in the transformation of our business and position Target to compete in this new era in retail. Because our business is so strong, we expect to fund these long-term investments while continuing to support our dividend and annual dividend growth even during the period of transition. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we\u2019re committed to maintaining the cautious posture that service well in the first quarter. While consumer spending growth remains strong, we\u2019re seeing a continued shift towards experience, which is absorbing a meaningful portion of that growth.","In addition to these consumer headwinds, we expect to see continued pressure from competitive closings and liquidations, which represent a long-term opportunity but defers consumer spending in the near-term. And finally, our efforts to enhance value perception and regain everyday price credibility will likely create some near-term headwinds before we gain traction overtime.","So now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the team who will provide additional detail on our performance and focus going forward. Later in the call, Mark will cover category performance and his team\u2019s efforts to support both sides of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. Then Cathy will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and expectations for the second quarter and beyond. But first, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to John who will cover the team\u2019s current efforts to modernize the supply chain in best and our store shopping experience and realize new capabilities for our guest. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks Brian. This morning, I\u2019m going to provide an update on our progress in rapidly testing and rolling out supply chain and technology innovations. These innovations are designed to provide more convenience, inspiration and faster fulfillment on behalf of our guests, regardless of how they choose to shop. Then I\u2019ll highlight investments we\u2019re making in our stores to re-imagine the shopping experience and roll-out new capabilities that will help us drive sales in all channels.","In our supply chain and technology areas, our teams are moving quickly, testing and iterating on our ability to increase speed and offer new services for our guests. In our Tribeca store in New York City, we are ready to begin a test in which we will offer same day delivery to guest at that store. At checkout, guests will have the option to choose to have their orders delivered to their home later that day in a scheduled delivery window of their choice. This test presents an opportunity to gauge guest demand for this service. In a high traffic location filled with urban guests who will appreciate the convenience. Through this test, we will begin insights about potential operational challenges and determine appropriate pricing and delivery windows based on guest preferences. This will help us to understand the potential to rollout a similar service more broadly overtime.","When I moved into my role leading operations, one the first things I've learned is that any supply chain test has to be accomplished in tandem with our current operations. As a result, we have to be very thoughtful about how we conduct the test, because we don't want to make changes that might impair day-to-day reliability. In the second quarter, we plan to open a new facility in the North East that will allow us to test differentiated distribution capabilities, including store replenishment based on the appropriate unit of measure on every item, including palettes, key specs and niches. By testing out of a separate facility, we can implement without disrupting day-to-day operations in any of our current facilities.","This new facility will help us learn quickly about both opportunities and complexities associated with this new distribution model. I want to stress that we're opening this facility so we can test and learn quickly, not to create new capacity. In fact, given our opportunity to continue increasing the speed and flexibility of our entire supply chain and leverage our stores to enable digital fulfillment, we have ample capacity within our current network to grow for many years. As we gain insights from the test in this separate facility, we will be better informed and prepared to rollout this new model into existing facilities overtime.","Prior to the launch of the new East Coast facility, we have been testing daily customer replenishment based on niches in a single store here in the Twin Cities market. This store has much lower volume than our stores in the North East, which provided us some much lower risk environment for this early test. Results have been encouraging as we've been able to dramatically reduce store labor dedicated to unloading trucks and stocking the sales floor freeing up time for the team to focus on serving guests.","In addition, we've been able to reduce inventory meaningfully and nearly eliminate backroom inventory of the items included in the test. And that's just some early bumps we've done so without affecting out stocks. With these insights, we are ready to move onto the next stage of testing with the new facility, and the team is eager to begin evaluating the results. With a faster and more reliable supply chain, we can develop new ways to leverage our stores and enhance convenience for our guests.","An example is our upcoming pilot of Target Restock, which will begin rolling out to Twin City's Red Card holders this quarter. This service allows guests to order a restock shipping box filled with essential items, like toothpaste, diapers, coffee and cereal and have been delivered to their homes quickly for a low flat fee. For the pilot, guests will have access to more than 8,000 items and will continue to experiment expand the offering based on our learnings and guest feedback. Because the items we package and deliver from a nearby store, orders placed before 1:30 pm will be delivered on the following business day. We built the Target restock site and supporting back-end operations for Twin Cities\u2019 team member test in just 35 days. Based on what we've learned in that test, we will launch an enhanced site for the Twin Cities\u2019 pilot and continue to iterate on the experience.","As we discussed at our Analyst Day, we believe that the future retail is both digital and physical and successful retailers will need to provide an outstanding experience in both. That\u2019s why we're moving quickly to elevate both the digital and in-store shopping experience, driving guest engagement and sales in every channel. For digital shopping, the challenge is to make it more experiential, delivering more of the inspiration you can find in a physical store. To elevate the digital experience in furniture and d\u00e9cor, which are already large and growing online businesses for us, we recently rolled out 360 degree shoppable living room, which serve as a digital showroom. Seeing the products staged in rooms in relation to other products helps guests to better understand the size and style of an item making it easier to shop. The experience will initially present about 120 products across four design aesthetics.","As you know, more than 40% of our digital volume already runs through our stores, and we peaked at more than 80% last holiday season because we can offer both order pickup and ship orders directly from our stores. While all of our stores have offered order pick up for several years, we\u2019ve worked hard to improve the experience and encourage repeat uses by our guests. And we\u2019ve seen a pay off from these efforts.","In the first quarter, more than 95% of in-store pick up orders were ready for guests in an hour less, up more than 3 percentage points from a year ago. Our net promoter score for the order pickup experience is improving steadily and is now actually higher than the score for our stores overall. In light of these trends, it's not surprising that repeat usage of order pickup has increased meaningfully compared with the year ago.","First quarter ship from store volume was more than double last year\u2019s amount, accounting for 27% of our digital sales. This growth was partially driven by approximately 600 shipped from store locations and we\u2019ve added since last year. However, the increase was also driven by additional volume running through stores that had this capability for more than a year. Specifically, for the 460 stores that were shipping directly to guests in the first quarter last year, year-over-year growth in shipped from store volume was 32% this quarter.","We continue to be very pleased with the ability of our stores to accommodate these higher volumes, and our supply chain team is enhancing end-to-end processes to allow for additional volume overtime. And importantly, the ability to ship directly from stores to nearby guests reduces our last mile shipping cost dramatically. Beyond digital capabilities in our stores, we are also investing in our team in the front of the store. We\u2019re providing tools and changing processes to enhance our team\u2019s availability on the sales force and making sure they are available during all hours the store is open.","In addition, we\u2019re investing in training to equip our store team member with more product expertise in key areas like food and beverage, beauty, apparel and electronics. And of course, we\u2019d begun investing in our existing stores to elevate the physical environment along with our level of service. Given that, our 21 first quarter remodels will only continue recently, we don\u2019t yet have a statistically significant read on post remodel performance, but early results are very encouraging.","However, for the set of remodels we completed last fall, we have been measuring overall results in line with our expected 2% to 4% lift following completion. Most encouraging for the 10 fold remodels in which the layout is more similar to the new layout we will roll out in Houston later this year, we have seen lifts near the high-end of that range. It's also important to note that we have a customized approach to remodels, and we have a low cost, high impact model that we can bring to our lower volume stores.","Even on lower investment in the range of $3 million, there is a meaningful change in the look and feel of the store and we see guest respond to that change, driving very healthy lifts in the 2% to 4% range as well. Finally, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new small format stores, which generate more than double the per foot sales productivity of our larger format stores. While we\u2019re happy with the performance of these smaller stores when they open, what\u2019s most encouraging is the continued growth we\u2019re seeing when the stores become mature.","Specifically, for our 10 mature small format stores, we are seeing double-digit comp increases on average so far this year. So I hope it's clear that our team is busy and energized, moving quickly with purpose to improve speed and agility to better serve our guests in every channel. Despite a challenging environment, I've never seen the team more focused on what need to deliver and more confident in our path forward.","Now, I'll turn call over to Mark, who'll provide more details on our performance and plans in merchandizing. Mark?","Mark Tritton","Thanks, John. As Brian mentioned earlier, we have seen very choppy trends since the end of the holiday season, and our team has moved quickly to adjusting real time. We've began seeing signs of improvement in late February and we've saw the strongest performance compared with our forecast in March.","We've maintained solid results in April, benefitting from both our Victoria Beckham partnership and the Easter holiday. As we've said many times, Target is a holiday destination and we've certainly saw that journey in Easter season. We saw the strongest growth in Candy and Easter day call, but we're also pleased with performance in toys and kids' apparel in the weeks leading up to the holiday.","And then this Victoria Beckham; given the brand she has created, we need that our partnership with her would be big and have delivered. More than half of our Victoria Beckham sales were made up by our most loyal guests. And in five cities we hosted our best Red Card Guests at exclusive events, providing early access to her products. Victoria Beckham baskets were more than twice the size of our average transaction and they weren\u2019t just focused on her items. In fact, there were nearly balanced between Victoria Beckham items and items from our broader assortment. And not surprisingly, her items sold particularly well first online.","Overall, we are very pleased with the results of this partnership, which has proven to be one of the biggest in our history. While macro factors likely drove some of the acceleration in March and April, we also saw the impact of warmer weather on our seasonal categories and our electronics business lift forward with the launch of the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo has long been aligned with our brand given their history of delivering hardware and games are entitled around activity and families. We worked closely with Nintendo team to launch the Switch supported by a multi-fascinated marketing plan that was a visible both inside and outside our source.","We also supported the launch online and saw great results by delivering a bundled offer for the Switch on our site. As a result, these efforts we've enjoyed a mid-teens market share in Switch since the launch. This is the great example of the power for successful collaboration with a national brand and why we love to partner with world class brands to create Target unique differentiated experiences for consumers.","Beyond video games, electronics also benefited from healthy growth in Apple Watch and iPhone during the quarter. As a result, for the first quarter in total, electronics delivered a mid-single digit comp sales increase, the strongest in three years. In apparel, trends have been challenging across the industry and we saw a small decline at apparel comps in the first quarter. However, when we compare our results to the industry, we continue to measure meaningful market share gains.","Last year, our apparel sales and market share gains were heavily concentrated in women's ready-to-wear and kids' apparel. This year, those categories continue to gain share, but we're also seeing gains across all of the subcategories, including, men's apparel, intimates and performance activewear. Trends in activewear have improved meaningfully since the relaunch of our C9 brand after the holiday season.","Swim is another big first quarter story in apparel, and we expect that to continue all year. As you know, we already have the number one unit share in swim. But as other retailers begin closing and exiting this business, we saw a big opportunity to gain an even stronger position. Our team worked quickly to launch our new brand Shade & Shore, which has delivered strong results in its launch. Given this momentum, we expect to see continued growth in swim in the second quarter and beyond.","For our less discretionary essentials and food beverage businesses, first quarter market share trends were more challenging. For the quarter, we saw low single digit comp declines in both of these business and we are taking steps to regain our value and every day price perception in both of these. This would begin in the first quarter and we recently launched our TargetRun and Done marketing campaign to support that work, but we have much more to do. In the second quarter and beyond, we will continue to invest in our regular prices and reinforce our everyday positioning. An important part of that work is to adjust our promotional posture on those items and categories so they better support everyday message.","In addition, we will work to balance our promotional posture between stock up offers and factors important for fielding trips, including an emphasis on individual items and low opening price points. I want to stress that this work is very detailed and surgical. There isn\u2019t a single solution across items and categories so that our team will be testing and iterating at a very granule level and they will be expanding the scope of their work as the year progresses.","Importantly, as Brian mentioned, as we are implementing these changes, we may see added pressure before we begin to see the benefits. However, we know this is the right thing to do and we\u2019re committed to making these changes to better position our business over the long-term. More value in everyday price perception are a challenge in our food and beverage category, I want to stress that we are seeing a couple of bright spots. First, we saw a small increase in produce comps in the first quarter, reflecting the work we\u2019ve done to gain credibility in this key part of the assortment.","We have worked with the projects vendors to reduce the time from their fields to our network and John\u2019s team has increased the speed of produce items into our stores once they reach that network. As a result, freshness and in stocks have been improving. We\u2019re also benefitting from the work in our stores to higher grocery experts and organize specialized teams who now own the end-to-end process in those stores. Another great bright spot is our adult beverage business, which saw a mid single digit comp increase this quarter. We continue to focus on developing localized assortments and more compelling displays, and our guests are really responding.","We plan to expand space for adult beverage in more than 100 additional stores in the second quarter with more planned to the third quarter and beyond. I also want to pause and welcome Jeff Burt who joined us in April to lead our food and beverage team. Jeff comes to us with more than 30 years or grocery experience, most recently leading Fred Meyer. Jeff is off to a great start, and I look forward to working with him to further strengthen this business overtime.","At our financial community meeting, in February, we announced our plan to roll out 12 new exclusive brands across our signature categories through next year, and we\u2019re getting ready to launch the first of those brands later this month. It's called Cloud Island, and it\u2019s a new exclusive line of nursery d\u00e9cor, bedding, bath and layette products designed by our own internal design team. We build this collection of more than 500 items to be both stylish and affordable with a focus on safety, durability and comfort.","We\u2019ll roll out the d\u00e9cor and bedding items to all stores and our five beginning May 28th and we\u2019ll follow with the bath and layout pieces later in the summer. This new brand is a natural addition to the successful kids\u2019 brands we launched last year Pillorfort and Cat & Jack, which continued to perform really well. The guest response to Cat & Jack, in particular, has been amazing. Among guest who purchased kids apparel for Target in the months leading up to the launch of this new brand, spending on kids' apparel increased more than 50% in the months following the launch.","This increase in spend was driven by both frequency and spend per visit. Even more encouraging, the launch board in NGN traffic to the whole category, leading to an increase in spending on kids closet Target even among guests who didn't by Cat & Jack. This shows why we are so excited about our plans to launch additional signature category brands later in the year and even more next year.","So in closing, let me leave you with a final thought. We understand that we are in the midst of very challenging period in retail and we're in the early stages of our plans to transform our business. That said you wouldn't feel that why if you interacted with our team, they're energized and hungry to win and focused on doing what it takes to get there.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance and outlook for the second quarter and full year. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks Mark. When we provided first quarter guidance at our financial community meeting, we described the challenging results we had seen so far in February. At the time, there were theories for why things might improve, but we felt it was best to plan for those challenging trends to continue and react quickly if conditions improved.","As we look ahead, we believe it's appropriate to continue to take this cautious approach as we plan for the rest of the year. After all, the environment remains volatile and the disruption from competitor closings doesn't look like it will change anytime soon. For the first quarter, comparable sale fell 1.3%, a little over half of this decline was driven by traffic, combined with a small decrease in average ticket. As we've said many times, traffic is the key metric for us, so we're taking steps this year to put us on the path back to growth overtime.","First quarter gross margin rate was down about 40 basis points to last year, driven by increased fulfillment cost resulting from the growth in our digital sales. Merchandise mix had a roughly neutral effect on our gross margin rate this quarter, reflecting the acceleration in electronics that Mark described earlier. While gross margin dollars declined about $130 million from last year, this performance was much better than expected, driven by better than expected sales and fewer clearance markdowns compared with our plans.","On the SG&A expense line, first quarter dollars and rates were better than expected as well. Consistent with our plan for the year, we began ramping up store labor on the sales floor. But in the first quarter, those investments in front-end labor were offset by savings in backroom logistics. In addition, we saw some timing favorability on several expense lines in the first quarter, which we now expect to see in the second quarter.","Our first quarter depreciation and amortization rate was up about 20 basis points compared with last year, reflecting increased costs from our remodel program on a lower base of sale. Altogether, our EBIT rate was 7.4% in the quarter, down from a very strong 8.2% last quarter. At the end of the quarter, inventory was more than 5% lower than a year ago, reflecting the early impact of our work to increase the speed of our supply chain. As I've mentioned before, we believe we have a compelling opportunity to free up working capital overtime by increasing the speed and accuracy of our supply chain. We're in the beginning stages of that journey, but it is encouraging to see early signs of progress.","As Brian mentioned, we invested just under $500 million of capital in the first quarter, a portion of these investments was focused on our stores as we started to transform the shopping experience in existing locations. In addition, we continue to grow our portfolio of small format stores.","We also invested in supply chain and technology to support new capabilities, including those John described earlier. For the year, we will continue to focus our investments on these priorities and we expect our full year CapEx will be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. On top of expenditures for new capital, we paid more than $330 million in dividends in the first quarter, and repurchased just over $300 million of our stock, primarily through a pre-existing trading plan that was put in place last year.","As we consider full year capital deployment and cash flow compared with last year, higher CapEx and lower EBITDA will certainly put some downward pressure on cash flow. However, we also expect some offset in tailwinds in 2017 as we continue to reduce working capital.","Altogether, as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we expect to continue to have ample capacity to support the dividend and grow annually. And overtime, to the extent we have excess cash beyond CapEx and dividends, within the limits of our current debt ratings we expect to have the capacity to repurchase our shares. However, given the recent changes in our operating model, we will stay relatively cautious about the pace of share repurchase in the near term.","My final comment on the first quarter is in reference to our return on invested capital. We earned an after tax ROIC of 14.2% in the 12 months through the end of the first quarter. I hope you'd agree that is healthy performance in any industry and any environment, but it's also slightly better than Target's ROIC through the first quarter of last year, excluding the one-time gain from our sale of our pharmacy business. I think that's helpful perspective as we move through a year of meaningful transformation. We are blessed to have a business that continues to generate good returns and have a strong balance sheet. That powerful combination gives us the flexibility to make changes that will position our business for continued success in this rapidly changing period in retail.","Now, let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. We are planning for a low-single digit decline in comparable sales in the second quarter. Just like the decision we face in the first quarter, we could plan for a more optimistic scenario but that would create undue risk in a very choppy environment. On the EBIT line, we are planning for a decline of just over $200 million compared with last year. We expect SG&A expense to be the primary driver of that decline as we continue to invest in store service and new capabilities, and we see the impact of the timing shift on several expense lines from the first quarter.","On the EPS line, these expectations translate to a range of $0.95 to $1.15 for both GAAP and adjusted EPS in the second quarter. For the full year, we are not updating our prior guidance. As a reminder, that guidance anticipates a low-single digit decline in comparable sales for the year and adjusted EPS of $3.80 to $4.20. Clearly, given that first quarter performance exceeded our expectations, there is a higher chance that we'll finish the year in the upper end of that range. However, with most of the year still ahead of us and the prospects for continued near term headwind, we believe these expectations are still appropriate.","Before I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to thank you for your continued engagement and support. Following our financial community meeting, we\u2019ve heard from many of you and as always, we appreciate your perspective. What's most encouraging is your support of our strategy and the steps we're taking to position our business for the long-term. Just as we do, you clearly see the risks and challenges in this environment. So it's been very helpful to know that you also believe in our strategy and the long-term investments we are making in our business.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian for some final remarks.","Brian Cornell","Before we turn to questions, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. First, while we're certainly pleased that Target's first quarter performance was better than expectations, we're not due any high fives in the room here today. Our first quarter performance is not what we expect to deliver overtime, and we're investing and moving quickly to deliver stronger, more consistent results in the future.","When we look ahead, we do so with our eyes wide open, aware of the challenges we're facing. But when I interact with our team, I see a lot of energy and optimism, a desire to deliver for our guests and win in the marketplace. What's most encouraging is the team's agility and responsiveness in a rapidly changing environment. When we're talking about the development of Target Restock by our technology and operations teams; the rollout of a new ad campaign by Target Run and Done from our marketing team; or the development and launch of a new brand like Shade & Shore for our merchandising team; everyone is focused on innovating rapidly like never before. I'm continually proud and impressed by what this team can accomplish.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, John, Mark, Cathy and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. ","Paul Trussell","Wanted to just inquire about the initial guidance given this year around the $1 billion investment; you mentioned some timing factors between SG&A in 1Q and 2Q. But even looking at the guidance provided for 2Q, the first half is certainly running at a run-rate below that of $1 billion in investments. Help us just understand have there been meaningful offsets, or should we expect a spike perhaps in that investment pace in the second half?","Brian Cornell","We're very focused on executing the plan we've laid out back on February 28th. So you\u2019re going to continue to see us invest in store labor; making sure our standards continue to improve; and we saw very strong progress in the first quarter; invest in value, and continue to invest in the growth of our digital business. So over the course of the year, we're committed to executing against that plan. We'll see that continue over the second, third and fourth quarter. But the plan we've lead out back in February is the plan we're going to continue to focus on executing throughout the year.","Our overall focus is continue to see traffic patterns grow in our stores, improve and accelerate our digital performance; we want to make sure we're capturing market share as we did in the first quarter; continue to build and invest in our brands; and ultimately, improve our value proposition with the guest. So there is going to be no change to the plan we lead out in February. We're committed to executing and making those investments over the balance of the year.","Paul Trussell","Thank you for that color. And just as a quick follow up, Cathy, you gave guidance for negative low-single digit comps in 2Q. Just help us understand some more of the puts and takes from a category standpoint. How are you guys focused on improving traffic trends back into positive side -- on the positive standpoint and then also specifically if you can speak on food aiming essentials, is really what I will let to dig on how we get that positive as well? Thank you.","Cathy Smith","We are working to restore our positive traffic and more importantly preference over the long-term and I think that\u2019s everything you continue to hear us say. And so over the course of Q2, we\u2019re going to just keep doing what we said we would do, and that is we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re continuing to invest in a great experience for our guest, both online and in stores and you will see us doing that. Mark and the team has some really exciting things coming into Q2, but don\u2019t want to just miss the positives we saw around the category mix in Q1 even. So I was just going to tell you we\u2019re just in this for the longhaul, we\u2019re going to keep doing what we said we would do and restoring positive traffics high on our priority list. Mark, do you want to talk about anything in particular with regards to food and beverage?","Mark Tritton","Paul, in terms of the promotional posture and the price value equation, we\u2019ve made some rapid changes in a number of our signature categories. But probably the key areas that we\u2019re focusing on of course the food and beverage and essentials. So we\u2019ve been testing righting quickly since Q4 and then in Q1, and we\u2019ll see an evolving pattern of change and evolution on we\u2019ll roll out. But the communication to the guest and the simplification of our everyday price positioning, and you\u2019ll see that evolve more deeply in Q2 and then beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simeon Gutman","So just to follow up on the guidance for the second quarter, can you just talk about the change in momentum that you experienced in March. Do you think that was the environment improving or was it some of your actions? You mentioned, I think Victoria Beckham and I don\u2019t think these things have been material, but I know that that product line came in March. And I don\u2019t know the timing of electronics and switch. And then that compares I believe get easier or got easier in April and stay relatively easy for the quarter. Can you give us a sense, is the run rate deteriorating or is your outlook just being conservative at this point?","Brian Cornell","Simeon, let me start by really summarizing Q1 performance. And certainly, I think we saw some changes in the overall macro environment. But I also saw -- we also saw very strong execution, both from a digital standpoint where we grew the business by 22% but also meaningful changes in store. And I think our store standards and our store execution continues to improve. I also think we showed great adaptability in the marketplace. And I\u2019ll let Mark talk about some of the successes we saw in categories like apparel. But I\u2019d highlight the efforts that we put behind our swim business where we start at number one share position, but we saw changes the marketplace competitive closures, competitive exits.","And as we talked about back in February, we are absolutely focused on taking advantage of marketshare opportunities over the next two or three years. And this is a great example where Mark and his team recognized the consumer opportunity, saw changes in the competitive environment, quickly built a brand by partnering with our vendors, and introduced Shade & Shore during the first quarter, which allowed us to take even more marketshare in swim. And it\u2019s a great example of the work that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on over the next few years.","Looking at the market, recognizing where we have competitive opportunities, where we can gain share and how we use both our digital and physical channels to meet the needs of the guest. Mark, what don\u2019t you just spend a few minutes, just talking about the work you and the team did to take advantage of the opportunity in Q1 with swim?","Mark Tritton","Yes, I think it's a great example of where we're excited about our new brand launches as we've been testing, learning and constantly iterating to create new ideas and they've really resonating with our guests. So as Brian talked about, the story here is really one about agility and marketing insight. So where we're already had a strong number one unit market positioning in swim, we didn't rest on our laurels, similarly to action in Kids. And we looked at this market with declining players and saw an opportunity to win even further.","So we looked at deep guest insights, market insight and worked really clearly closely with our vendor insights to create a new brand, a new paradigm and a new service level for our guests, all in a very rapid period of time. Launching Q1 Shade & Shore gain share and half amongst of our guests has creating accelerated growth, and real confidence for us as we do build our brand portfolio. And it's important to notice, as Brian said, this was an omnichannel play. So we looked at both stores and online to meet the guest needs and get exemplary results.","Simeon Gutman","And my follow-up\u2026","Brian Cornell","More work to do as we go into Q2. And as we talked about during our prepared comments, Q1 we've remodeled 21 stores; we have got much more work to do over the balance of the year; we opened up four new small formats; we started to make very surgical investments in value; and simplify our value communication in store and amplify that with a new advertising campaign that we called Target Run and Done. So in the early stages, we're going to continue to build off of that. We want to make progress every quarter, but we recognize it's going to take time.","And we're going to stay very focused, very measured against the initiatives we've lead out. And quarter-by-quarter, we're going to strengthen our performance, continue to drive traffic to our stores, more visits to our site and capture market share as we improve our value perception and continue to build proprietary brands within our portfolio.","Simeon Gutman","And then if I could ask one follow up on investments, you mentioned you're starting to make some value investments. Can you give us any color on timeframe, on categories, is it broad based? And back to the earlier question, it looks like this quarter the decline in EBIT looked commensurate with the comp decline. It didn't look like this was a big period of investment. I think behind the scenes, there might be that we don't see. So just curious of how we should lay that out for the rest of the year?","Brian Cornell","Mark and Cathy have both discussed, we are making investments in value; very much focused on helpful essentials and food and beverage; those are going to continue over the balance of the year; and we're going to be very surgical; we're going to measure and iterate; we've already made some significant progress in simplifying our overall value and promo communication; and now we\u2019re enhancing it with additional advertising dedicated to those core household essential items that drive trips to our stores. So you\u2019re going to continue to see that focus not only over the balance of this year but overtime.","Cathy Smith","Maybe, Simeon, I'll add on just real quickly. So let\u2019s look at the SG&A line, in particular, to give you an example. We invested more hours in the store and store service and store experience, and obviously, we also invested in marketing. But it's being offset because of all of the work we're doing around in our supply chain and fulfillment, in the backrooms of our stores we're starting to see some of the benefits there. Again, we're early days of a long journey. But you are seeing some of that offset. So it doesn\u2019t show up as apparently on the SG&A. And then I\u2019d remind you to look at, clearly not where we want to be, but sales down slightly and EBIT down quite a bit more. So the investments are coming through, as we said, and it's not going to show up in any given quarter, it's going to show up over the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Edward Kelly","Could you talk about how your strategy in food may evolve with hiring of Jeff Burt from Kroger? And I guess if you were to take a step back and really think about it. What are the two or three things that you really are looking for him to accomplish here?","Brian Cornell","Let me start. First of all, Jeff has only been on board for a handful of weeks, so still in the early period of time really trying to understand our business, assimilating to the Target environment. So we want to certainly give him plenty of time to assess our business and begin to build strategies, going forward. But I think it's important to recognize he\u2019s not starting from square one. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been very focused on improving the quality of our branch assortment. And the work that our merchandizing team and our supply chain team have done, we\u2019ve made significant progress in improving freshness evolving our assortment to make sure we have more organic natural gluten free items in our assortment in each and every category where we participate in food and beverage.","As you heard us talk about time and time again over the last few quarters, we\u2019ve made significant progress in categories like adult beverages. So Jeff will build off of that work. We certainly recognize based on the work we\u2019ve done in Los Angeles with the LA 25 remodels and additional remodel activity in the Dallas, Fort Worth market that as we change the in-store environment and elevate the presentation, the guest is responding very, very well. So if we want to give Jeff plenty of time to take his own inventory, begin to build his own strategy that will enhance the work that we\u2019ve been doing over the last couple of years. And we\u2019re very confident that overtime Jeff is going to build a plan that will allow us to continue to accelerate our performance in those important food and beverage categories.","Edward Kelly","Just a follow-up related to food, on Monday, there was an article in the journal about you guys I am sure you saw. There was a mention in there about maybe your interest in sprouts last year. I am just curious as to how do you think about acquisitions generally? And are you interested, willing and thinking about out of the box alternatives through maybe like M&A to reposition this business?","Brian Cornell","Ed, we look at M&A opportunities all the time, but we look at them through a filter of what\u2019s going to really enhance our current business initiatives. So I would put out of the box on the side and really think about M&A as something is going to compliment and strengthen our core strategy, help us accelerate complement the interaction we have with the Target guests, and we\u2019ll continue to look strategically at M&A opportunities overtime.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","So, on the investments you\u2019re making this year. To what degree are you moderating and altering them based on the week-to-week and the sales trends that you're seeing? So if sales are better than expected, are you actually pulling back on some of those investments?","Brian Cornell","Michael, we are very focused on executing against the initiatives and investments we outlined earlier in the year. So we'll continue to iterate as we learn through our remodel experience, as we continue to open up new small formats. We learn every day as we develop new brands, but our focus remains the same. So you shouldn't expect to see any drastic changes. And we'll continue to mature those initiatives overtime.","Cathy Smith","And what I would say, Michael, is we're accelerating when we test and learn and validate we accelerate our investment into that area. And so that's where we're looking across the Company as only see an opportunity to accelerate something that's working along our strategy that's what we're doing.","Brian Cornell","But Michael, over the next couple of years, you should expect that to continue to focus on reimagining our existing stores; adding new small formats to bring us into urban market and on to college campuses; our continued investments in supply chain and technology; the support of our new brand that we'll be launching over the next 18 months; those commitments will not change and our focus is on execution. And I think what we saw in the first quarter is a company that's making progress; we still have a long way to go; but continuing to focus on executing each and every day, both in our physical and digital channel; and that's not going to change over the next few years.","Michael Lasser","Brian, within the grocery and essentials category, can you give us a sense where you think your pricing gap is to the market today? And where do you think it needs to be overtime?","Brian Cornell","I think that we started work here in earnest in Q4 and continuing with healthy work in Q1. We actually show our industries are actually closer than the guest gives us credit for. And that's an issue for us, because we know that's a bigger message that we need to covey.","So we're continuing to sharpen our price and our value messaging at the same time and make sure that we move to more regional based pricing, localized pricing so we\u2019re more relevant to the guest in the competitive set, which is not what we're doing during \u201916 and we're rapidly iterated on in '17. So you see more of that activity and more of that benefit as we move through 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","With regards to moving to EDLP and value messaging, I just wondered how much that move weighed on margins in Q1 and where you're seeing more success in that move. And where you think you have more work to do? And then in that same context, I think you've noted before that there is some fits and starts with how you've communicated your value message. Can you explain how and what you did during Q1 to convey that better to your customer?","Cathy Smith","So I'm happy to start, Kate. Good morning. And then Mark can amplify as well. So on the impact that we saw coming through gross margin, as Mark shared and we've shared actually for a couple of quarters. Our biggest work has got to be around making sure that the value we're delivering is really clear. And it's going to take a while for our guests to give us a credit for that. And so that's the work that we're going to continuing to do. So while we're sharpening and making it more regionalized, you'll see that come through slightly. But the bigger effort is all of the work we're doing, and like the Target Run and Done campaign that we launched this last quarter and making sure that our guests recognize the value we are delivering.","Brian Cornell","I\u2019d just add into that, Kate. Our assets, as we\u2019ve discussed, are quite surgical. So we're doing this area-by-area, classification-by-classification as an involving transfer. And we've really begun those efforts through Q1 but more in the backend as we match to the Target Run and Done campaign. So what we're seeing here is that on the handle side, we've been, clearly we\u2019ve had up to 28 different handles that we've been using to resonate value across all our classification. So rationalizing the voice and the nomenclature down is part of that. So that's why we'll come into Q2 with an evolving position and we'll assess its impact and its opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Melich","I had a couple of questions; one, Cathy, sort of a housekeeping. You mentioned there was a timing issue in SG&A. Could you quantify how much that helped SG&A or how much we should expect it to come-in in the second quarter?","Cathy Smith","As we said in our Q2 remarks and guidance, we expect couple of hundred million dollars of EBIT decrease. And we also said that the majority of that would be in SG&A, so it's pretty, I think it's pretty safe to assume that that would be how I quantify the shift from Q1 into Q2.","Greg Melich","And then a bigger picture question, you talked a lot about traffic. But I don't think we've test yet on the loyalty programs and the frequency you could drive from Red Card and Cart wheel. And it\u2019s been a lot of change in the market, whether it's Amazon Prime or Costco with their new Credit card or Walmart with free shipping thresholds lowering. How are you guys thinking about integrating those programs to really help drive traffic? And is there a time this year that we should expect to see that maybe enhance or roll out?","Brian Cornell","Greg, we'll talk more about that in the second half of the year. We're spending a lot of time right now with Rick Gomez, who's now our Chief Marketing Officer really stepping back and thinking about loyalty and importantly, as you said the integration of the Red Card into that loyalty program. And one of the other highlights from the first quarter is the continued penetration growth of our Red Card. So we recognized that the very important asset that we need to leverage going forward. And Rick and his team are working right now to think about the next phase of loyalty and how we continue to leverage the Red Card to build even stronger relationship with our guests. So you\u2019re spot on and we'll talk about that much more in the second half of the year.","Greg Melich","And on sales, just a follow ups. It sounds like sales improved in March and April, but were still negative. I just want to make sure that's right?","Brian Cornell","Greg, we don't break out monthly sales. As we've said, we saw strengthening in the latter half of February, into March and April. But obviously, our comps were still down for the quarter. So we've had work to do. We're not satisfied with where we ended up. But we certainly feel good about the progress we made in the quarter; and importantly, the market share gains that we saw in very important signature categories. So we're focused on driving traffic. We are certainly committed to restoring positive comps throughout our system. But one of the other important metrics that we're going to be looking at every single quarter is how we're performing from a market share standpoint. And I feel very good about some of the market share gains that our team achieved in Q1. We're going to continue to focus on market share opportunities throughout the year.","Operator","Our final question comes from John Zolidis with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","John Zolidis","Question on the performance of the smaller format stores, you mentioned that they had sales productivity roughly 2 times that of the larger more suburban base stores. Aside from the difference in either being an urban or suburban location. What do you attribute or what can you tell us about why the productivity of those boxes is so much better? And is there any learnings you can take from those small format stores to extend to the balance of the chain?","Brian Cornell","John, there is a lot of learnings that we're bringing forward from those small stores, not only as we expand into new markets but as we think about application to our traditional stores. I think the biggest learning is as we move into these new neighborhoods, consumers love Target and they love the brand. And the response we're seeing has been really outstanding. So we feel very good about our small format strategy as we move into new neighborhoods; we're getting better and better are curating and localizing assortment; understanding how to operate in various markets; and we're also encouraged to see the early top results as we lap some of the new small formats we opened up last year. So encouraging signs, and we're going to build off of that as we go forward.","So we feel good about the progress we made in Q1. But as a team, we're not doing high fives. We know we've got a lot of work to do. But I think it's important as we aim to recognize, as a Company, we have a very strong foundation. And if you look at our results in the first quarter, we generated $16 billion of revenue. Our operating income was almost $1.2 billion. We are able to invest $500 million of CapEx and still see a very strong return on invested capital of over 14%. And as we did that, we're able to reduce inventories by over 5%. So we know we've got a lot of additional work to do. But I think it's important to recognize; we're a fundamentally sound Company; we've had a very clear strategy in place; and now our focus over the balance of the next three years is week-to-week execution, both from a physical and digital standpoint.","So we appreciate you dial in today. We look forward to talking to you at the end of Q2. And operator, that concludes our call. Thank you."],"20451":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q1 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call May 22, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","John Hulbert - Vice President of Investor Relations","Brian Cornell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","John Mulligan - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Mark Tritton - Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer","Cathy Smith - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Sarah McCann - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett","Edward Kelly - Wells Fargo","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Michael Lasser - UBS","Kelly Bania - BMO Capital","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday May 22nd, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer, Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on our first quarter performance, our outlook and progress on our long-term strategic initiatives. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","This morning, we\u2019re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.","And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our first quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year and beyond. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John. We\u2019re really pleased with our first quarter financial performance, which reflects continued progress on the strategic initiatives we began rolling out more than 2 years ago. Since that time, we\u2019ve seen a meaningful acceleration in our business.","In fact, the first quarter marked Target\u2019s eighth consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases. In the first quarter, comparable sales growth of 4.8% was a bit ahead of our expectations. As Mark will cover in more detail, this was driven by broad strength across all our merchandising categories, particularly in Toys and Baby.","We also saw strength across channels in the first quarter. Store comparable sales were up 2.7%, while comp digital sales were up 42%, adding 2.1 percentage points to company\u2019s comp growth.","As John will cover in more detail, we\u2019re seeing a really positive guest response to our same-day digital fulfillment services, which drove well over half of our digital sales growth in the quarter. Our ability to offer these same-day services, which delivers high level of satisfaction, is a result of our strategy to put stores in the center of fulfillment.","In fact, our stores handled more than 80% of our first quarter digital volume, including all of our same-day options combined with digital orders shipped directly from stores to guests\u2019 homes.","Across both our stores and digital channels, sales growth continues to be driven primarily by traffic. Specifically in the first quarter, comp traffic was up a very healthy 4.3% on top of 3.7% a year ago.","On the bottom line, our first quarter performance was also stronger than expected. Against an expectation for a slight rate decline our operating margin rate increased about 20 basis points in the quarter.","This performance reflected the benefit of disciplined expense control combined with a favorable mix of digital fulfillment. Altogether, the first quarter earnings per share grew more than 15% at the top end of our guidance range.","At our Financial Community meeting in March, we talked about our work over the last few years to create a durable model for Target, one that will drive continued engagement and relevance with consumers and support a financial model based on growth on both the topline and the bottom line.","In the first quarter, we saw the benefit of this new model. Early in the quarter, we experienced some choppiness in daily sales results, driven by unfavorable weather conditions in different parts of the country. And towards the end of the quarter, we saw the impact of late spring weather in our Seasonal businesses.","Against this backdrop, our business performed really well benefiting from multiple drivers, including strong holiday performance in the Valentine's Day and Easter periods, along with the reliable everyday traffic in our Food, Beverage, and Essential categories.","Beyond short-term weather fluctuations, we continue to see a healthy economic backdrop for our business which is evident across multiple metrics, including employment, wage growth, consumer spending and overall sentiment. Against this backdrop, Target continues to grow traffic and sales more quickly than the market, resulting in share gains across all of our key merchandising categories.","And while the team has accomplished an incredible amount over the last few years and we\u2019re pleased with our current performance, we are not slowing down. Our stores and supply chain teams continue to roll out and scale up an interesting leading suite of digital fulfillment options.","And as John will cover in more detail, our guests are responding enthusiastically, driving rapid growth of our same-day options, including Drive-Up, in-store pickup, and Shipt. At Shipt, we continue to grow the number of marketplace participants, driving scale and relevance to the platform.","In the first quarter, both CVS and Petco launched nationwide on the Shipt marketplace. Our merchandising teams continue to deliver newness through existing brands, while adding new brands to supplement our assortment.","In the first quarter, the team launched three new owned brands, in Intimate Apparel; a new natural owned brand in Essentials; innovative national brands including Flamingo and Welly in personal care; and our new Home brand, Sun Squad to help our guests celebrate the summer season.","Our property teams continue to rapidly transform our store network. The team completed another 53 remodels across the country in the first quarter and they are on track to deliver approximately 300 remodels this year. Guests continue to respond to these projects by shopping the remodel stores more often, driving incremental traffic and sales.","And finally, our team opened seven small formats across the country in the first quarter allowing Target to serve new neighborhoods in metro areas like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington D.C. and new markets like Santa Barbara, California.","Before I turn to the outlook, let me comment briefly on the topic of tariffs. As you know, the trade situation has been fluid for some time and we\u2019ve been carefully monitoring negotiations to assess potential implications and our point of view has been consistent for some time.","As a guest focused retailer, we\u2019re concerned about tariffs because they lead to higher prices on everyday products for American families. Our team continues to monitor trade negotiations and develop contingency plans to help mitigate the impact of tariffs on our guests and on our business.","It\u2019s important to note that Target\u2019s multi-category portfolio remains a competitive advantage. When there are external impacts to one business area or category, we\u2019re able to balance the impact across our business in ways not available to a single category retailer.","And as you\u2019ve seen in our recent results, the team has been able to manage through last year\u2019s tariffs with minimal impact and we have plans in place to mitigate the impact of additional tariffs already scheduled for next month. As always, we remain focused on being priced competitively every day, delivering value for our guests, while judiciously managing our margins.","With that, let me turn briefly to our outlook and Cathy will provide more details in a few minutes. For the second quarter, we\u2019re looking to deliver a low-to-mid, single-digit increase in our comparable sales. This expectation is a bit slower than our first quarter pace, given they were about to annualize over last year\u2019s closing of Toys \"R\" Us and Babies \"R\" Us stores across the US.","On the bottom line, we expect to generate a mid-single-digit increase in operating income dollars, which will translate to even stronger growth in earnings per share. For the full year, we\u2019re maintaining our expectations for both comparable sales and earnings per share. The first quarter was a great first step in delivering our full year guidance, giving us continued confidence in our ability to deliver outstanding performance in 2019 and beyond.","So now, before I turn it over to John, I want to thank the entire Target team for their continued passion and tireless focus on delivering for our guests. It\u2019s because of their hard work that we are able to share these outstanding results with you today. Each and every day, I am energized and grateful to work with this amazing team.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to John, who will talk in more detail about our efforts to elevate the shopping experience for our guests, regardless of how they choose to shop. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Brian. As you know, for several years now, we\u2019ve been focused on building and rolling out a comprehensive set of digital fulfillment capabilities, allowing us to provide our guests a convenient fulfillment option for every shopping journey. As a result of those efforts, Target now offers more digital fulfillment options across more of the country than anyone else in retail.","Think about it, when guests are planning on being out their neighborhood, they can shop on their digital device and we hand them their order in an hour or two. We offer in-store pickup in every one of our 1,851 locations, and we walk the order out to the parking lot in more than 1,250 of them. There are no fees for either of the same-day options.","And of course, guests more than 1,500 stores across more than 250 markets can order from Target through our Shipt personal shopping service, and have their order delivered to their front door, kitchen table, even their refrigerator if they want in only an hour or two.","Shipt offers unlimited free same-day delivery from Target and more than 50 other retailers across the country for $99 annual fee. There are nearly 100,000 Shipt shoppers delivering orders across the country today and it's still growing rapidly as we welcome new marketplace partners and expand in new markets.","In dense urban areas, where we\u2019re building small format stores, we offer a service in which guests who shop in-store can ask us to hold their basket at checkout and deliver to their front door later that same day in a time window of their choosing. For this service we charge a flat fee of $7 with no annual fee and our guests love it.","Once we solve the problem of carrying the order home, it frees them up to shop more, a lot more. Average basket size on these orders is more than five times bigger than the average for these locations, and they include a very strong mix of items from our Home category.","Beyond all these same-day options, when guests need to replenish their pantry, they can order our \u00a345 shopping cart size box of essentials, and we\u2019ll deliver it the next day. For this service, we charge an industry leading delivery fee of only $2.99 with no annual fee.","And of course, guests can shop target.com on their desktop or mobile device, and we\u2019ll deliver their order to their front door in two days or less. There is no annual fee, and we don\u2019t charge a delivery fee, if you have a REDcard or meet the $35 order minimum.","To support all of these options, same day, next day, two day, our strategy puts our store teams and fiscal assets at the center of the bull\u2019s-eye. Now of course, like everyone else, a portion of Target\u2019s digital orders are and will continue to be shipped from upstream fulfillment centers. And other items will continue to be shipped directly by our vendors.","But given our strategy assortment in the way our guest like to shop, the vast majority of our digital orders are already being handled by our store teams, whether that means shipping packages out of the back of the store, delivering orders in the front of the store or in the parking lot or having a Shipt shopper bring it to their front door.","Despite the success, we\u2019re already seeing, we continue to hear questions about the long-term viability of keeping our stores at the center of fulfillment. Our answer is empathic, we are confident that this is the best long-term solution for Target.","But I also want to emphasize that this is already a highly effective strategy today. Digital accounted for more than $5 billion of Target sales last year and our stores fulfilled about two thirds of that volume.","This year, given our digital growth trajectory and the rapid adoption of our same-day services, we are on track to grow Target\u2019s digital sales by more than $1 billion in 2019 and fulfilling even higher percentages of this volume from our stores. So I want to emphasize that we\u2019re not talking about a theory. This is reality today and it\u2019s a meaningful and growing part of our Retail business.","We've said many times that using our stores as digital hubs enhances our speed and reduces cost. And importantly, moving to store fulfillment does not increase the frequency of split shipments. In fact, even though store fulfillment continues to grow rapidly, the rate of split shipments this year is running lower both in our stores and in total compared with last year.","Let me add quickly, like everyone else, we have a continued opportunity to realize cost savings by reducing the frequency of split shipments even more. That is one reason why we are focused today on developing an enhanced inventory planning and control system, which will deliver increased precision in our inventory allocation, reducing the number of occasions when a split shipment is needed.","Importantly, from a guest perspective moving fulfillment into stores has delivered high levels of satisfaction. Specifically, we are seeing stable to improving Net Promoter Scores on mature fulfillment capabilities, like pickup and shipped to home. And we\u2019re seeing unusually high Net Promoter Scores for newer same-day services like Drive-Up and Shipt.","One reason for high guest satisfaction is that store fulfillment increases our reliability. At our contact centers, which handle guest questions about their digital orders, we have seen meaningful declines in our contacts to order and contacts per unit even as we have rapidly launched new services and move the bulk of fulfillment into our stores.","In fact, contacts per unit in 2019 have been running 50% lower than we were seeing only two years ago. Given the high level of satisfaction associated with our new fulfillment options, we are also seeing a rapid change in the mix of our digital sales. Specifically, in the first quarter well over half of our digital growth was driven by same-day fulfillment options, in-store pickup, Drive-Up and Shipt.","Put another way, these three services drove more than a quarter of our total company comp growth of 4.8%. Importantly, our analysis indicates that the new services like Drive-Up and Shipt are driving incremental trips for Target rather than simply replacing other forms of shopping. Specifically, first quarter digital sales from in-store pickup increased more than 80% from a year ago even as Drive-Up and Shipt grew even faster. And let's not forget the conventional in-store shopping, which continues to account for the vast majority of our sales, continues to see increased traffic and comp sales as well.","This reflects a key aspect of our strategy, while we have quickly established ourselves as a leader in terms of convenience and digital fulfillment, we are equally focused on maintaining the leadership position of our in-store shopping experience. That\u2019s why we\u2019re remodeling 300 stores a year, keeping us on track to complete 1000 remodels by the end of next year.","These projects elevate the look and feel of the store, create more compelling displays in key categories, like Apparel, Home, Beauty and Food and Beverage and reconfigure space in operations to support all of our new digital fulfillment options.","Re-modeled stores continue to experience incremental sales in the year following completion of the remodel and we\u2019ve been measuring another incremental growth in the second year as well.","Beyond the physical environment, we are making significant changes to the operating model in our stores, finding efficiencies that reduce non-guest facing activities and allow us to build more hours to helping our guest. We are staffing our stores with category experts in areas like Apparel, Beauty, Electronics, and Food and Beverage who can move beyond task and share their expertise with guests, providing advice and perspective to help them find that the best products to meet their needs.","Some of these experts were already on our team, but this new model allows them to focus on their passion rather than serving as a general athlete across multiple categories.","In other cases, we\u2019re hiring category experts who have gained experience at other retailers and who are excited to come to our team and participate in our growth. And all these changes have been enhanced by our commitment to reach a national minimum wage of $15 an hour by the end of 2020.","Only a couple of years ago Target's national minimum was $10 an hour. That has already increased to $12 today and we announced that we are moving to turn up $13 next month.","While this decision obviously involve some cost pressure, we have successfully controlled expenses to manage the P&L impact even as we've added guest facing hours in our stores.","Looking ahead, our work on store replenishment will deliver additional cost savings as we move store backroom activities upstream into our distribution facilities. And those facilities where we realize scale efficiencies and automate a portion of those tasks. Over time, this work will enhance our inventory allocation, delivering higher in stocks, while reducing safety stock across the chain. And it will free up additional space in our stores to accommodate further growth in digital fulfillment. These replenishment efforts are still in the early stages and it will take years not quarters to roll out this new model across the chain.","We are very encouraged with the results we are seeing in our test of this new model in Minneapolis and our Perth Amboy facility. And we\u2019ll continue to test and learn as we expand this model to more of the chain over the next several years.","So before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to pause and thank our team for all the amazing results we\u2019re seeing across the business. These results were years in the making and lot of our team\u2019s efforts were behind the scenes, but those efforts were necessary to create the strong foundation that\u2019s enabling everything we\u2019re seeing today. Clearly our guests are happy with the results, which was evident in our strong performance on both the topline and bottom line in the first quarter. Mark?","Mark Tritton","Thanks, John. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are really pleased with the quality and breadth of the growth we've been seeing across our business and that is certainly true of our category performance.","For more than a year now we have been seeing broad sales strength and market share gains across multiple dimensions including both our style and frequency businesses during holiday periods and in between, across both own brands and national brands and all five of our core merchandising categories.","Across our core categories, we still have the strongest first quarter growth in our Essentials and Beauty and Apparel categories, both of which saw comp growth of more than 5%. In Essentials and Beauty, which comped more than 7%, results were led by Baby, over the counter and Beauty and Cosmetics.","In Apparel & Accessories, we saw particular strength in intimates and sleepwear, Baby and Swim. Among our other core categories, comp growth was about 3% in each of our Food and Beverage, Home and Hardlines categories.","Within Food and Beverage, we saw growth in every subcategory, but it was the strongest in adult beverages, which comped in the mid-teens this quarter. In Home, results were led by kitchenware, storage and decor. In Hardlines, results were led by double-digit growth in toys.","To build on this strong performance, we continue to invest in newness and differentiation, both in existing brands and by launching new ones across our curated assortment.","In the first quarter, we completely transformed our assortment of presentation in intimates and sleepwear and launched three new brands: Auden, Stars Above and Colsie. All of these three new brands are size inclusive and designed to make guests at any age feel confident and comfortable.","In addition to launching these brands, we redesigned both the digital and in-store shopping experience in ways designed to make shopping easier and more inspiring. The guest response to these changes has been phenomenal, and as I already mentioned, these categories delivered standout performance in the quarter.","In Essentials last month, we launched a new natural owned brand Everspring. This entire line of more than 70 items is made from plants, renewable materials and recycled paper. The packaging includes graphic icons that allowed guest to quickly understand product attributes and what ingredients are not in the formulation.","In fact, all Everspring products qualify for Target Clean, a new symbol we have designed to both simplify and indicate products, formulated without chemical ingredients that guests may want to avoid.","Everspring products were developed by our internal design team and feature carefully selected scent profiles, including citrus and basil. Prices in the assortment range from $2.99 up to $11.99 and the entire assortment on average is priced nearly 20% below comparable products in the marketplace. This new Everspring initiative complements other strong Q1 launches of exclusive to Target's natural brands, like Flamingo and Wally that Brian mentioned earlier.","In February, we announced that we are introducing toddler sizes into our Art Class brand, which we first launched in 2017. Art Class brings a versatile fashion forward aesthetic to Kids Apparel and we know that many parents are looking for a diverse range of style and aesthetics for the younger kids as well.","We\u2019re excited to feature to this new cover of assortment in more than 1100 of our stores and on target.com at a time when many competitors in this category are closing their doors. And we also recently introduced a new seasonal owned brand Sun Squad to help guests celebrate the pure joy of summer.","Again, developed by our internal design team, this assortment features more than 600 items from pool floats to larger than life sprinklers, beach totes and coolers, designed to encourage families to get outside, create lasting memories and make the most of the summer season. We priced these items to deliver amazing value with some items priced below $2.","And in Food and Beverage, following the wildly successful launch of our California Roots brand, we recently added the collection to our wine assortment. The collection brand offers high quality wine at affordable price, combined the very best of carefully harvested grapes featuring five premium varietals at $9.99 per bottle.","And last week, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re introducing men\u2019s grooming items under our Goodfellow & Co brand name. This men\u2019s brand has seen an amazing response since we launched it in the fall of 2017, driving strong market share gains at the men\u2019s apparel assortment.","Given that men are increasingly doing their own shopping for grooming at personal care items, we want to ensure the Target is there destination for those categories. The assortment here features more than 30 products priced between $3.99 to $16.99, and again positioned about 20% lower than comparable men\u2019s premium brand.","And finally, of course, we just launched our much anticipated limited time collection of products from Vineyard Vines. This collection of more than 300 items includes apparel, accessories and swim for the whole family, along with the distinctive assortment of home and outdoor items.","The style is unmistakable and the prices are amazing ranging from $2 to $120 with the majority of items priced below $35. We launched this collection last weekend on our stores and on target.com and we maximized the impact by presenting all these assortment together near the front of our stores. The response both in our stores and online exceeded our expectations and our team did a great job accommodating the surge in traffic.","Altogether, the Vineyard Vines launch is already one of the most successful in our history. When you combine that insight for the better-than-expected results we\u2019re seeing from our owned brand and exclusive brand launches you gain a deeper appreciation of how our guest respond to newness and inspiration in our assortment.","So I want to thank my team for everything they are doing to deliver the results we\u2019ve been seeing, across the whole team, design, sourcing, buying, operation and that thanks extend to all of our vendors partners too.","I'm really excited to see their alignment, their energy and their collaborative passion to inspire our guests. It's because of their work that we are so confident as we look ahead. We are ready for the upcoming holiday and seasonal events, including Memorial Day, Father\u2019s Day, the 4th of July and the beginning of Back-to-School.","But we\u2019re also focused on the categories to sustain our business in between these life events, including our Essentials and Food and Beverage categories. These categories are the focus on Target Run and Done marketing campaign and our continued work to ensure we remain priced right daily.","When we incorporate our merchandising efforts into all the other initiatives that our driving our business, re-modeling our stores, delivering convenience with new fulfillment option, elevating service in our stores, reaching new neighborhoods with our small format stores, something really special happens for our guests. Target becomes more relevant to them and they choose to shop us more often. Guest traffic is the ultimate reward for our efforts.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Cathy who will provide more detail in our first quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks, Mark. As Brian mentioned, our first quarter financial performance was ahead of our expectations on both the topline and the bottom line. Our comparable sales growth of 4.8% was on a strong end of our expectations for a low to mid single digit increase and our EPS of $1.53 was just beyond the top end of our expected range.","Store comparable sales growth of 2.7% drove just over half of the total company comp, while comparable digital growth of 42% contributed another 2.1 percentage points. Among the components of comparable sales, first quarter traffic growth of 4.3% was the primary driver combined with an increase in average ticket of one half of 1% [ph]","Our first quarter gross margin rate of 29.6% was about 20 basis points lower than last year. Among the drivers, digital fulfillment and supply chain cost accounted for about 50 basis points of pressure, which was offset by about 30 basis points of benefit for merchandising initiative implemented by Mark and his team.","Our first quarter SG&A expense rate of 20.8% was about 30 basis points better than a year ago. This rate improvement was better than expected and driven by a number of factors, including a small benefit from the timing of marketing expense compared with last year, along with cost efficiencies in our technology operations.","Overall, we saw excellent cost control across the company, which allowed us to offset continued pressure from higher wages across the country. As expected, we also saw a small leverage benefit on depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter. Altogether, our first quarter operating income margin rate was about 20 basis points better than a year ago and better than our expectation for a small rate decline.","As a result, first quarter operating income dollars were 9% higher than a year ago. Interest expense of $126 million was $5 million or 3.3% higher than last year and our effective tax rate from continuing operations was essentially flat to last year.","Diluted shares declined about 4% compared with a year ago, reflecting the continued benefit of our disciplined approach to capital deployment. Altogether, our GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.53 were 15.1% higher than a year ago, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.53 were 15.9% higher than last year.","Turning to cash flow, our operations generated more than $300 million of cash in the first quarter. This was down from a year ago as the benefit of higher profitability was more than offset by a decline in payables. This quarterly result was a timing issue related to our elevated inventory position at the beginning of the quarter.","For the year in total, we expect to maintain payables leverage at approximately the same rate as in 2018 and generate strong cash flow from operations. We deployed first quarter cash from operations, proceeds from debt issuance, and cash on hand to fund $655 million of CapEx, $330 million in dividend, and the repurchase of $277 million of our shares.","We were pleased with the results of our March debt transaction in which we issued $1 billion in 10 year debt ahead of our upcoming $1 billion maturity in June. This deal benefited from our strong credit ratings and the current momentum in our business which allowed us to price the notes very attractively.","And finally, I want to close my discussion on the first quarter with an update on our after tax return on invested capital. Excluding discrete tax benefits from Federal tax reform in both years, our trailing 12 month after tax ROIC was 14.1% in the first quarter compared with 13.5% a year ago.","We are pleased with both this absolute performance and the relative improvement from a year ago, as we continue to focus on driving long-term value through our operating and investment decisions.","Now let me turn to our guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. As Brian mentioned, we expect to deliver a low to mid single digit increase in our second quarter comparable sales. We expect this will be somewhat slower than our first quarter comp growth, given that the tailwind from Toys\u201dR\u201dUs and Babies\u201dR\u201dUs will annualize in a few weeks.","We expect a slight amount of leverage on our operating income margin rate, driven by relatively small changes in our gross margin, SG&A, MD&A expense rate. This performance would lead to a mid single digit increase in second quarter operating income dollars and EPS performance in a range centered around $1.62. At the midpoint of this guidance range, we would deliver high single digit growth in GAAP EPS from continuing operations and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS.","For the full year, we are maintaining our previous guidance for both comparable sales and EPS. The strength of our first quarter performance has reinforced our confidence that we can meet or exceed these full year expectations and we are looking forward to delivering strong performance in 2019 and beyond.","As I have mentioned before, we have made a lot of progress in the 2 years since we initiated number of important changes to our operating and financial model. We made these changes to accelerate our progress in rolling out new fulfillment options, to rapidly improve our owned brand assortment, transform more of our stores faster and perhaps most importantly accelerate investments in our team.","At that time, we told you we were confident that these were the right decisions to change the pace of our near term performance and position Target for long-term success. We also expressed confidence that an acceleration in our operating performance would translate into strong financial performance following the transition to this new model.","And today, it\u2019s great to be able to go beyond expressing confidence and actually demonstrate how this new operating model is successfully delivering relevant, growth and profitability. I'd like to thank our team for their work to enable the strong performance and to everyone on the call for continuing to follow us on this journey.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Cathy. In a moment, we\u2019ll move to your questions. But I want to spend a minute and wrap up with what we covered today. And what I hope you heard today is that we\u2019re really happy with the path we're on, a path that began well over 2 years ago. And today our business is generating strong performance across the board from traffic and sales to operating income and EPS.","To get to where we are today, we decided to make some bold changes over the last couple of years. But I want to emphasize something important about those decisions. When we made them, we explicitly focused on taking a different path than our competitors. We said, we would open stores when others were closing them. We said, we'd invest billions of dollars in our shopping experience and in our team when others were pulling back. We said we'd use our stores as digital hubs, because it delivers speed and convenience for our guests and it aligns with our digital strategy. We said we'd invest in differentiation, when others were simply looking for scale. And we said, we'd maintain our balanced multi category assortment, one that\u2019s unique in US Retail.","So when we get asked today, why aren\u2019t you doing what others are doing? The answer always starts with the fact that, we\u2019re not trying to be like everyone else. At Target, we perform best, when we\u2019re pursuing our own path, not when we\u2019re chasing someone else. And our first quarter performance is a clear example of benefit of that approach.","So with that, I want to thank you for your time today. And now we\u2019ll move to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may go ahead.","Sarah McCann","Great. Thanks. This is Sarah McCann on for Ed. Thanks for taking our question. Can we click down on where you saw the cost savings in the tech expense bucket that drop -- drove some of the SG&A leverage in the quarter? And then how would you score your ability to offset those digital fulfillment and supply chain costs going forward? Thanks.","Operator","Please standby. We are experiencing technical difficulties. You will hear silence until the conference resumes.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Again, please stand by. We are experiencing technical difficulties. You will hear silence until the conference resumes. Thank you all for standing by. The call will now resume. And our first question was coming from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead and ask your question again.","Sarah McCann","Hi. This is Sarah McCann on for Ed. Thanks for taking our question. We were just hoping to click down a little bit more on where you saw the cost savings in the tech expense bucket that drove some of the SG&A leverage in the quarter?","And then how do you score your ability to offset those digital fulfillment and supply chain costs going forward this year? Thanks.","Cathy Smith","Good morning, Sarah. I'll quickly answer that. This is Cathy. You know, as we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we did see some favorability in our tech operations. As you know, they continue to be working on just the most important things and then being really effective and efficient in their work. So that's providing some benefits.","We saw some general cost control across the entire company. We saw some marketing timing and we saw that being offset by some of the wage pressures that we were seeing. All of that said, plus 30 basis points improvement in year-over-year SG&A.","Brian Cornell","And Sarah, why don't I have John Mulligan spend a few minutes talking about the benefits that we\u2019re seeing as fulfillment moves to some of our same-day services.","John Mulligan","I think the thing we\u2019re most excited about in the Digital business, Sarah is that, guest preference as we observe it, the fastest growing thing, the fastest growing services we provide are in same-day, that's Order Pickup, Drive-Up and Shipt. Those are also our most profitable services that we provide through the digital channel.","So as they continue to grow meaningfully faster than the rest of digital, we expect our digital profitability to improve. So we\u2019re really excited because the guest preference is meeting up with exactly the capabilities we have and they happen to be the most economically feasible for us going forward.","Sarah McCann","Thanks so much.","Brian Cornell","Thank you, Sarah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. You may go ahead.","Chuck Grom","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a good quarter. Just a follow up on that John, you know, the digital fulfillment cost kind of running in roughly 50 to 70 basis points of pressure over the past few quarters. Would you expect that to begin to abate given that the penetration of the \u2013 the more profitable parts of the digital business are going to start to grow?","And then Cathy, just as a follow-up, could you just review the second quarter margin assumptions again for us? I know you are saying slight leverage on the operating margin line, but I didn't hear the exact components across gross margins, SG&A, and depreciation?","Cathy Smith","Yeah. Let me start. Good morning, Chuck. Thank you. So for second quarter, we said that we would see a slight leverage in our operating income margin, so just a little bit there, and relatively small changes in all three of their subcomponents, so think gross margin, SG&A and depreciation.","So pretty much -- just a pretty consistent quarter as we\u2019re already expecting to be supported by that topline of low-to-mid, single digit. And then, it will end up in a mid-single-digit increase in op income dollars. So pretty much consistent with what we just said.","John Mulligan","And I think Chuck, stepping back from perhaps the basis points of gross margin, I think we\u2019ve been very consistent in saying that we see great benefit in using the stores as hubs. I think that\u2019s where we see. We are able to bring great speeds to our consumers. Same-day we just talked about that. Next-day, two-day, whatever it is, we can do all of that through the stores. It\u2019s faster and it's more efficient for us from an economic perspective.","So we feel really good about the path we\u2019re on. We feel great that same-day is growing much, much faster than digital and the benefits that will bring to us economically. So, we think we\u2019ve got a really good path forward to continue to build on what we\u2019ve already built from a capabilities perspective.","Chuck Grom","Yeah.","Brian Cornell","Chuck, I\u2019d only add on. I think you should expect to see our Q1 performance really serve as a proxy for our performance over the balance of the year. Low-to-mid growth in comps, mid-single-digit improvement in operating income, and high-single-digit improvement in EPS, and I think that's going to be kind of the pattern for the balance of the year.","Cathy Smith","You know, I think to summarize there too, we just grew digital at 42%, and we grew op income dollar and rate both expanded.","Chuck Grom","Great. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Kelly","Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning and nice quarter. I just wanted to \u2013 I want to start with comps. Can you just give a little bit more color on cadence of comps throughout the quarter, especially the choppy start and the better finish? What you're seeing so far in Q2? ","And then I wanted to ask about second quarter guidance, and how you are thinking about this comparison, you know, low to mid singles is an acceleration even at the low end and you left the possibility of the high end open, which is I guess remarkable to know. Can you just maybe talk about the optimism behind that as well? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Yeah. And I'll start. I know we saw very consistent performance throughout the quarter. Actually we talked about in our prepared comments, some strength that we saw from a digital standpoint as we exited the quarter. But, across our entire portfolio, we saw market share gains very consistent to comp performance, both in-store and from a digital standpoint, and we expect that to continue in Q2 that we did during - as we talked about guidance. We are now going to lap the closures of TRU in the second quarter, so we'll see some moderation in the growth that we've experienced in Toys and Baby.","But I think we have a very clear plan for the balance of the year, going into the second quarter and we're very confident that we\u2019re going to continue to see market share gains in a consistent rhythm of comp increases, operating income improvement, and that\u2019s going to flow through the EPS. So a very consistent set of performance drivers throughout the quarter that will expand into Q2.","Edward Kelly","And just one follow-up on Chuck's question about the gross margin. If we think about the impact of fulfillment on the margin, relative to the dollar growth that you are seeing in digital, that relationship I guess seems to be improving.","And I guess could you maybe just talk about the underlying efficiency in terms of what\u2019s happening with orders that are sort of filled year-over-year, as well as how the mix is impacting that line item, and how we should sort of think about the opportunity for improvement going forward there?","Brian Cornell","Well, I'll go back to some of the points that John made during our March Investor Conference. As we move digital fulfillment from upstream DCs to stores, we see a significant reduction in expense and we talked about a 40% reduction.","When we go from an upstream DC to some of our same-day fulfillment offerings, like Order Pickup and Drive Up, we see a 90% reduction in costs. And as John talked about those were the fastest growing parts of our digital fulfillment during the quarter and we expect that to continue.","It\u2019s clearly where we're seeing the guest preference. We saw a tremendous amount of growth in Order Pickup, despite the fact that we\u2019ve been offering that for almost 5 years now. We\u2019re seeing dramatic acceleration in the Drive Up offering and very strong performance from Shipt.","So those were much more favorable from a expense standpoint and they are preferred by the guests. So as that continues to mature and grow, we're going to see some of the benefits flow through our P&L.","Edward Kelly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. You may go ahead.","Robby Ohmes","Hey. Good morning and great quarter. I\u2019m actually going to ask two questions. One was just a follow-up, you know, Brian on your answer there, I get this question all the time, as you keep shifting digital fulfillment to the stores, how are you - how is the store SG&A not exploding or offsetting, you know, just maybe a little more color on how you are getting those dramatic savings, the 40% and 90% reductions?","And then I\u2019ll just tell you, the second question is on the second quarter, I\u2019m just curious how you are - let me say it this way, some of your competitors are not doing as well as you might have done and they might have a lot of excess inventory in things like apparel. And I'm just curious what you think the environment is going to look like with a lot of your - some of your large competitors not in great positions right now?","Brian Cornell","So why don't I let John start by talking about some of the process improvements we\u2019ve made in-store and the way we\u2019re leveraging technology and systems to drive even greater efficiency as we fulfill those orders and then I\u2019ll come back and talk about the competitive environment.","John Mulligan","Yeah, Robby. I think the first thing I\u2019d say is, we are investing payroll in the stores to take care of the fulfillment that is going on. The one thing we don't want to do and we have been clear about this is pull payroll off the sales floor to take care of what's going on in the backroom. So we have put additional payroll in the backroom. And, of course, that payroll gets re-classed to gross margins because it is part of our fulfillment expense.","But to Brian\u2019s point, I think the other thing, the stores team has done an outstanding job of discontinuing to refine their processes and introduce new tools that allow our teams to get more efficient, particularly in backroom operations, logistics of the store. So we\u2019re able to pull hours out of there either let them fall to the bottom line or more importantly we have reinvested a significant amount of those hours back into the sales floor to create a better service environment.","And we\u2019ll continue to work on that. The stores have great plan. They continue to do that, as we do more upstream and supply chain, we will continue to pull those back office, backroom, logistics kinds of hours out to the store, either centralize them upstream and make them more efficient or process optimize them, bring better tools from our technology partners to the stores, so that they get better and better. And that\u2019s a loop we've been on for quite some time. So the store\u2019[s teams, the technology teams have done an outstanding job of continuing to manage our overall store expense.","Brian Cornell","And Robby, if we turn to the overall retail environment, we\u2019re seeing a very consistent and healthy environment across the US. I think what we\u2019re seeing right now is the bifurcation of winners and losers. And I think our performance now speaks for itself.","We're on eighth consecutive quarters of growing comps. We\u2019ve seen consistent market share gains across all of our categories and we\u2019re performing both from a store standpoint and digital standpoint.","So we feel really good about the progress Mark and his team made from a merchandising standpoint. The reaction we\u2019re seeing to our own brands and the execution that we\u2019re seeing in-store. So we think we\u2019re well positioned to continue to grow share in this environment.","And I think what you are just seeing is you\u2019re seeing the emergence of winners who have been investing in their business, that are adapting to this new omni-channel environment. And unfortunately those that are ceding share that have not been able to invest and evolved to the new consumer environment.","Robert Ohmes","Great. Thanks so much.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. You may go ahead.","Joe Feldman","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask as you guys start to lap the Toy business, Toys 'R' Us in last year, the other - I know it has the comp impact, but it also - if I recall correctly had a gross margin impact negatively when it happened just because Toys are lower margin. How should we think about that sort of benefit so to speak as you start to cycle that this year, as it relates to the gross margin?","Brian Cornell","Mark?","Mark Tritton","Yeah. Look I mean, it does provide a high level of stability going to second and more in third and fourth quarter. I mean, we\u2019ve been buoyant across the board because of that healthy mix and the strength of our own brand margins, so that\u2019s helping contribute to the overall mix. This will be a further stabilization point.","But the one real benefit that we can utilize and continue to build on is the traffic that we've been building, which has gained market share for us in critical businesses like Baby, Kids and Toys and the halo effect of that well it begin last year and it's continued all the way through into this strong quarter.","Joe Feldman","That's great. Thanks. And if I could follow up maybe on some of the newer initiatives you guys have in place, and if you could you know, like to circle loyalty program test that's going on and the new e-commerce marketplace and just things like that - that you're working on maybe just an update on how those performed during the quarter?","Brian Cornell","Joe, still again in the early stages we\u2019ve expanded our Target Circle program to a number of new markets. We are very pleased with the way the guests are reacting and we certainly think that it\u2019s something we're going to expand over time.","Our Target Plus program off to again to a very good start, great response from vendors. But we\u2019re in the early stages. We want to make sure we stay focused on curating the right assortment by category for our guests. So more to come going forward, but both initiatives being well received, and we\u2019ll continue to look at expanding those over time.","Joe Feldman","Great. Thanks. Good luck this quarter, guys.","Brian Cornell","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Two questions. One, how have you factored in the move to 25% tariff on the current lift into your guidance? And how will your guidance change if we go to 25% tariff on higher set of products that are imported from China?","And then my second question is given all this traffic that you're seeing from in-store fulfillment and same-day pickup and Shipt, how are you converting more items into the basket for those guests that are coming into your stores to pickup orders? And what can you do to improve that conversion? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","So Michael, I'll start with the topic of tariffs, and as I said in our prepared remarks, obviously, we have been monitoring this very carefully. It has been a fluid situation for quite some time now. You know, our point of view hasn't changed. And as we think about tariffs we reflect on the impact it could have and will have on American families that are going to be paying higher prices.","But I think our teams have done a very good job of trying to mitigate the impact in the short term. And as I think about where we sit going forward. One, I\u2019ll start with our multi-category portfolio is a huge advantage in this environment. And our ability to flex our focus from category to category is something that\u2019s somewhat unique to Target versus single category retailers.","We also have Michael a very experienced and talented sourcing team that works in over a dozen offices around the world, that focuses on this each and every day. They work with some very sophisticated vendor partners that for years now had been working to diversify their manufacturing base. And those are big advantages for us going forward.","I'm going to let Mark and John talk about the fact they were actually with those vendor partners just last week making sure that we're constantly looking at the evolving our plan to anticipate some of the changes in the environment.","So we\u2019re watching this very closely. But we have the advantage of multi-category portfolio, a very talented and experienced sourcing team that operates around the world and sophisticated vendor partners that have been looking at ways to diversify their manufacturing footprint for years now. Mark, you were there last weak as was John, any feedback from those meetings?","Mark Tritton","Yeah, Michael I'll just share with you, John and I and others were in Asia last week meeting with our global vendors not just China or Asia based vendors and clearly tariffs was a point of discussion. Our current actions are not reactive, they are responsive and we\u2019ve been planning these for some time, looking at the level of potential change and working with our deep vendor base we have trusted partnership and leveraging our current strength of performance to build opportunities to diversify, to work through price changes, and again as Brian said a very sophisticated and elevated team who have been anticipating change. And I think when you look at our Q1 results where we\u2019re able to effectively mitigate those risks from prior announcements, I think it bodes well for how we look to manage these moving forward.","Cathy Smith","Michael, this is Cathy. Maybe I'll just answer to be clear that the anticipated 25% increase that will go in place in June is contemplated in our guidance, so to be clear there. And then you would ask a question and Brian and John should answer too, but on converting our basket or converting those same-day services and as we shared we\u2019re seeing a lot of incrementality in those same-day services.","And as kind of the fact that\u2019s pretty amazing is the 80% increase in order pickup, while we're well into that journey, that just shows that we're deepening our relationship and being more relevant for our guest so that they're choosing Target more often, as we provide convenience and ease.","John Mulligan","I think, Cathy hit right on Michael, that certainly when people come in for pickup in-store, price traffic a percentage of them go on and buy something else in the store. But our focus really is on being true to the mission that they have and it is Drive Up, we give their bag and they are on their way. We\u2019re not going to bother them with a sales pitch.","A pickup they want to get in and out, that's great too and then when they come to store and they get their Starbucks and they work the whole racetrack, we'll provide a great set of experiences there. So we want to meet them wherever they are and to Cathy's point continue to drive that engagement with Target.","Brian Cornell","Finally, it gets back to our focus on being America's easiest place to shop. To John's point, we want to make sure we meet the guests on their terms, make it really easy and convenient for them to shop with us, and we know some days they're going to be pulling in our parking lot and hoping to be out of there in minutes.","Other days, they're going to come in, grab that cup of Starbucks and enjoy walking the racetrack and seeing what's new and exciting this weak at Target. So we got to make sure, we\u2019re playing on the guest terms and I think our strategy right now is meeting the guest right where they want to be.","Michael Lasser","They are really helpful. Thank you very much.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. You may go ahead.","Kelly Bania","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a quick one on the guidance for the year, just given the strong start, how much of maintaining that, just has to do with conservatism as Q1 tariffs or maybe any other factors you\u2019re seeing in the business?","Brian Cornell","Kelly, I think, again we were really clear back in March that we felt very good about 2019. I think our first quarter validates our guidance for the full year. And we feel very confident about the fact that we\u2019ve got guidance that's realistic. We're going to continue to focus on execution each and every quarter.","So no change in our guidance. We've got confidence that we're going to deliver as we said, low to mid single digit comps, mid single digit expansion of operating income throughout the year and that's going to flow through to high single digit EPS with very strong return on invested capital.","So we feel really confident about our outlook for the second quarter and the full year, recognizing it's still early. We're sitting here in May. But we're off to a very good start. The guest is responding incredibly well to our merchandising offerings, our own brands, over fulfillment options. And we're going to continue to stay very focused on execution each and every week of the year.","Kelly Bania","Okay. Thanks. If I could just add one follow-up, just on your ship to home model, obviously, a lot of competitors in the market moving more towards the next-day ship to home model. And obviously Target having a lot of success with the same day and pickup and Drive Up.","But just curious and I guess you have seen next day with restock, but do you feel like you need to match for this service more broadly on a wider assortment? And can this be done if so from your stores? Or does this need to be done from an FC down the road?","Brian Cornell","Kelly, I'll go back to some of the point that John Mulligan has made. Clearly as we talk to the consumer, we talk to the guest, we know how important convenience and speed is and that's why several years ago, we made the decision to put our stores at the center of our fulfillment strategy, and you're seeing that pay off right now.","Obviously, we're seeing a growing desire for our guest to take advantage of some of the same-day services and very strong growth with order online pickup in store, Drive Up, take advantage of over a hundred thousand Shipt shoppers that can bring their order to your home within hours.","But as we look at the benefits of shipping from our stores, even today on any given day upwards of 50% of our orders are delivered next day and it's using our stores and their proximity as that advantage in our overall strategy.","So, we think we're very well positioned today. We're leveraging the fact that we're so, so close to the guest with our 1851 locations and ease and convenience as a big part of our strategy.","So John, I don't know if there's anything else you'd add. But, I think our decision years ago to put our stores at the center of our fulfillment strategy is paying off with accelerated growth, up over 42%, tremendous growth in order online pickup in stores and dramatic acceleration in areas like drive up.","All right. Operator, we've got time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Seth Sigman","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of points. I guess first just looking at the comp trends, transactions growth very strong. Over the last couple of quarters your ticket growth has been less of a contributor to comps. And you have a number of initiatives you talked about throughout the call that and theory should be supporting bigger baskets. And I think some others in the industry have also talked about a little bit inflation coming through.","So just curious how you guys are thinking about the drivers of ticket and how we should be thinking about that? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","As we sit here today, we\u2019re very, very pleased with the overall basket performance. But what\u2019s happening is we're seeing acceleration in traffic. The guests are simply shopping us more frequently, and we\u2019re meeting more their needs each and every day.","So, I think the most important barometer is we\u2019re putting great traffic growth on top of strong traffic growth from last year. I think that two year stack on traffic is 8% and we're seeing the guest engaged in more categories, shopping more often. And we're really pleased with the composition of our overall results.","So we're going to continue to build off of that. Guests are responding well to the offerings that we're bringing each and every week. And we're driving more footsteps to our stores and business to our sites, and we're going to continue to leverage that in the second quarter and beyond.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thanks for that. And just if I could just follow-up on tariffs, I'm thinking specifically about the flow of inventory. If I go back to third quarter, I think you have some challenges maybe related to the ports, and you also talked about some incremental cost at that point.","What are you seeing today? And do you feel like you\u2019re more prepared to avoid some of the margin pressure you experienced back then? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","So, going back to last year, we made some very specific surgical decisions to invest in inventory, specifically in categories like Toys and Baby and holidays as we're preparing for the season. So we didn't incur some of those challenges you just talked about. It was very strategic, very specific to categories, and we feel like we're in the very strong position from an inventory standpoint as we go into the second quarter and the balance of the year.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Brian Cornell","Operator, with that\u2026","Operator","Thank you\u2026","Brian Cornell","We're going to close our first quarter earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you later in the year."],"20489":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call November 19, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","John Hulbert - Senior Director, Investor Communications","Brian Cornell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Kathee Tesija - Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer","John Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer","","Analysts","Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital","Greg Melich - Evercore ISI","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Michael Lasser - UBS","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 19, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Senior Director, Investor Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.","This morning, Brian will discuss our third quarter performance and our priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond. Then Kathee will provide more detail on recent performance and outline our plans for the fourth quarter including the holiday season. And finally john will provide more detail on our financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning\u2019s press release posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his comments on the third quarter and our priorities going forward. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John. And good morning to all of you. We are pleased with Target's third quarter financial performance which we announced earlier this morning.","Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 was better than our guidance of $0.40 to $0.50. Driven by US segment comp sales growth of 1.2% which is also better than our expectations.","Importantly the US segments saw positive comps in all three months of the quarter. And we are encouraged that the pace of US traffic continues to recover for a very challenging trend earlier in the year. While US traffic still declined slightly in the third quarter, performance was more than a full percentage point stronger than traffic trends through the first half of the year.","As we mentioned in our second quarter earning call, we saw a strong start to back-to-school and to the back-to-college season and that strength continued in September. Like many others, our sales slowed as we entered October, but recovered nicely towards the end of the month as we approached Halloween.","While our Canadian segment continues to see robust year-over-year growth, third quarter sales in Canada fell short of our expectations. As Kathee outlined in our last earnings call, the team in Canada has been working diligently to make improvements to operations, assortment, and pricing, in preparation for the fourth quarter.","With these changes we believe we are better positioned to serve our guests at a time of the year when traffic will naturally be higher. The guest response to these changes both in their shopping behavior and overall sentiment towards Target will inform our perspective as we continue to assess our longer-term potential in Canada.","As I visited stores across the US and Canada, and worked with the Target team, I have been continually impressed with the level of their talent and passion to perform.","As the leadership team has begun, our work to develop Target's longer term goals, we have aligned around five key operating principles. First, we will provide strategic clarity to the team. Second, we will articulate what Target stands for in today's retail marketplace. Third, we will thoughtfully prioritize what we do applying discipline to ensure we are focused on work that adds the most long-term value. Fourth, we will invest resources, and build capabilities to support our priorities so the team is equipped to deliver on these goals. And finally we will foster a culture of accountability at all levels of the organization.","While our work to define Target's longer-term vision is not yet complete, we've made significant progress in defining the short and longer term priorities for our business. First, omni-channel and flexible fulfillment capabilities are key to our long-term success.","Target's digital sales are growing much faster than the industry and they have been accelerating all year and we are planning for even faster growth in the fourth quarter. But our omni-channel journey is just beginning. As we plan for the future, we will take a channel-agnostic view of our growth allowing our guests to interact with us where and when they want, online, in stores and on their mobile device. And because an increasing number of Target visits begin on a digital platform, we will continue to push ourselves to innovate and build capabilities and features into our digital experience that will inspire guests while removing friction from their daily lives.","Second, we are defining how we will strategically segment our categories and increase our focus on signature categories we can and should be known for. Categories like baby, kids, wellness and style.","Over time we will work to grow these areas more quickly by investing a higher share of our resources including capital, marketing and product development. Importantly this view of segmentation doesn't mean we are abandoning our other categories. Let me restate this. It does not mean we are abandoning our other categories. But we will have different expectation for those categories compared to the ones in which we are investing to outperform.","For example, we believe we should continue to present a meaningful food offering in our stores and online. But we need to ensure that our food offering is uniquely Target and clearly differentiated from our competitors.","Looking ahead, we know our identity and food will continue to involve a combination of national brands and our own and exclusive brands with increased emphasis on natural and better-for-you products.","Third, we know that localization and personalization will be a key focus going forward. Fifteen years ago, all Target stores were virtually identical, and were focused on providing consistent assortment, and experience across the country. In today's world we need to continue to maintain our brand standards across every store. But our guests expect each of our stores to reflect the local communities in which they operate.","In the past we have taken some initial steps to localize our store environment and assortment. But we have only scratched the surface to this opportunity. Similarly, Target's digital experience will become increasingly personalized for every guest.","This year we have developed and rolled out a new personalization engine which is currently generating product recommendations for guests on our digital platforms. Even though this new engine is in the beta rollout stage, conversion rate from its recommendations are already exceeding what we were previously seeing with the third party product.","As we continue to make changes based on initial learning, we expect conversion rates will expand further overtime. Looking ahead we expect to leverage this engine's capability to provide customized experiences across our digital platforms.","As we contemplate potential store growth, we believe that smaller formats present an exiting opportunity for Target, because urban consumers have such a high affinity for our brand. If we can reach more of these guests with small flexible formats like City Target and Target Express we can offer urban consumers greater convenience, unique merchandise and an outstanding value with extended assortment available at target.com.","And finally as we plan for the future, we must focus on ways to responsibly control cost to help fuel investments in our growth. The team has made solid progress in expense optimization effort over the last few years, but we believe we must continue to find cost saving opportunities in the years to come.","In the coming months, the leadership team will continue our work to fully math out longer-term aspiration for Target and we will communicate those plans to you early next year. In the near-term we are focused on strong execution our fourth quarter plans both the US and Canada. These plans are designed to embrace the core of our expect more, pay less brand promise inspiring our guest with unique products and experiences while providing unbeatable value to our low prices. Kathee will provide more detail in a few minutes.","In Canada we are expecting much better fourth quarter performance than we experienced last year. But we know that to succeed in Canada we will need a major step change in performance. The fact is, given where we are performing today, we need to see improved financial performance from every Target store in Canada overtime. The team has worked hard to prepare for the Canadian operations for the fourth quarter. And we will be watching to see how those improvements connect with our guests during the holiday season.","While there is much more work to be done, I am very pleased with the momentum we are seeing in the US business, and the changes we have implemented to better position our Canadian segment.","My confidence in the potential of this company and this brand have only been reinforced in the last three months as I gain deeper knowledge of Target to my work with the team. I am committed to realize in the potential of this great American brand to the benefit of our guests, team, shareholders, and communities. And I believe we are taking the right first steps in that journey.","Now I will turn the call over to Kathee for a recap of the third quarter performance and our plans for the holiday season. Kathee?","Kathee Tesija","","Thanks, Brian. On our last conference call, we outlined that we had already seen a strong start to the third quarter driven by initial results in the back-to-school and back-to-college season. A key question at the time was whether this early strength would prove to be temporary resulting in a pullback later in the quarter. With the quarter now behind us, I am happy to report that we continue to outperform our US forecast throughout the quarter and saw positive US comps all three months. ","As Brian mentioned earlier, third quarter US traffic was down slightly from a year ago but we are encouraged that our traffic trend has improved meaningfully every quarter this year. Consistent with year-to-date trends, average ticket increased 1.6% in the third quarter driven by growth in average retail per item, particularly partially offset by a decline in items per basket.","At a category level in the US, third quarter comparable sales performance was strongest in healthcare and beauty led by beauty which continues to benefit from this year's store fixture innovations, and the introduction of new brands. Third quarter comps in home were up in the low single digits with particular strength in seasonal categories, benefiting from back-to-school, back-to-college sales early in the quarter and late quarter strength in Halloween.","Third quarter comp sales in grocery were up in the low single digits, and hard lines was up slightly led by toys which saw a high single digit increase on strength in licenses like Frozen and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.","Comp sales in apparel were down slightly as strength in baby and kids was offset by softness in jewelry accessories and intimates. From a mixed perspective it's worth noting that our combined home or combined comp in home and apparel was the strongest we have seen in two years.","In October and early November, we completed the rollout of our new apparel fixtures and layout to an additional 600 stores bringing the total to about 650 locations featuring this enhanced presentation.","Consistent with our expectations, the US third quarter gross margin rate was about 50 basis points lower than last year, about half the decline we saw in the second quarter. This reflects continued moderation of our promotional intensity which we intentionally moved higher in the wake of last December's data breach.","Digital sales were up more than 30% in the third quarter and contributed about 60 basis points our US comparable sales growth. Consistent with the rest of the industry, all of our digital traffic growth is on our mobile platforms where third quarter traffic grew more than 50%. Conversion this quarter was up strongly on both the conventional site and on mobile compounding the benefit from the traffic growth.","Following the success of our second quarter decision to offer free shipping on all target.com orders over $50, in October we announced that we are offering our guests free shipping on all orders this holiday season.","Since this announcement, our guests have responded enthusiastically. We've seen a meaningful increase in both orders and conversion compared with trends prior to the announcement. Of course I would be remised if I didn't point out that REDcard holders continue to receive free shipping on all orders year round.","In Canada, third quarter sales were up 44% from a year ago moderately below our expectations. Our third quarter gross margin rate of 19.5% was consistent with our expectations as we continue to clear excess inventory from earlier in the year.","As Brian mentioned the team in Canada has been working diligently to improve operations, assortment and pricing and our internal measures show that we are making progress.","However we are also measuring the impact these changes are having on Canadian consumer sentiment and that data is more mixed. We will continue to measure guest sentiment in the fourth quarter when all of our recent improvements will be fully in place and traffic will be naturally higher.","As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and the holiday shopping season, we are excited about our plans to inspire our guests with unique products, outstanding deals and increased convenience provided by our flexible fulfillment efforts. On our digital platforms, we are coming into this holiday season with many more capabilities than we had a year ago. In fact it was about a year ago that we rolled out in-store pickup across all of our US stores. So far this year store pickup orders have averaged about 15% of digital traffic with more than 80% of orders ready within an hour.","Based on last year's results, we expect in-store pickup orders will become a much higher share of digital traffic in the days leading up to Christmas as consumers increasingly value the certainty this service provides compared with the potential risk posed by weather related shipping delays. And we continue to explore potential enhancements to flexible fulfillment like our curbside test, pickup test in 10 San Francisco Bay Area stores and our same-day delivery test in Minneapolis, Boston and Miami.","The Target app and Cartwheel are both top 10 retail apps, and we continue to innovate to maintain our leadership position in this space.","In the third quarter we re-launched our mobile and tablet apps making it easier for guests to locate and purchase what they are looking for with interactive store maps and shopping lists, streamline checkout and the addition of Apple Pay for the iPhone app.","Our new list function automatically notifies guests when an item is on sale or eligible for an offer on Cartwheel, and our new interactive store maps show item locations throughout each store. For our in-store Black Friday guests this year, special interactive maps will show door buster locations throughout each store.","We completed a successful national-wide rollout of ship-from-store capability in October. With the rollout we are now shipping about 60,000 eligible products from 136 stores in 38 markets covering more than 90% of the US population. The ability to access stores inventory to fulfill online orders improves our digital in-stocks and drives incremental sales in situations where we are out of stock in our fulfillment centers. And while shipping from stores significantly lower shipping costs, most importantly it allows us to get items into guests' hands more quickly. This change is already being noticed.","In the third quarter Internet Retailer reported a survey showing that we were leading our competitors with the fastest delivery having been near the back of the pack earlier in the year.","We recently rolled out and improved omni-channel experience for our registries with new web-enabled smart scanners and a matching target.com user experience. The new smart scanners allow guests to add items more quickly to a registry and new features like collections and check lists provide inspiration and help guests build registries more quickly.","Guests can add online-only items like specific colors or models right from the device in the store without having to edit online at home later. And companion and related products are suggested immediately when a guest adds an item to their registry. And when gift givers access a registry on our new in-store iPad kiosks, they can send gift list to their smart phones via SMS with saving time, reducing costs and eliminating waste from paper printouts.","As we enter the holiday shopping season, we are featuring a dazzling array of unique and exclusive products and of course outstanding deals. In September we announced that Target would be partnering with TOMS on a limited edition holiday collection of home goods, apparel, accessories and shoes for women, men and children.","Similar to TOMS' one-for-one giving model, for each item purchased, a donation will be made with the potential to provide more than 11 million meals, blankets and shoes to those in need. The collection rolled out at all Target stores in the US and Canada and on target.com on November 16th.","We also recently announced our holiday collaboration with Faribault Woolen Mill. Founded in 1865 and located on the banks of the Cannon River in Faribault, Minnesota. This mill is part of American history having provided woolen blankets for pioneers headed west and for American troops in two world wars.","On November 2nd, we rolled out a variety of American made giftable items from this iconic company featuring 100% wool scarves, throws, tote bags and tech accessories in four patterns available exclusively on target.com. If there's one thing we have learnt from our partnerships with Taylor Swift is that our guests can't get enough of Taylor and her music. Even though gifting season is yet to come, our Target exclusive deluxe edition of Taylor CD titled 1989 featuring three exclusive songs and voice memos that gives fans unique insight into her song writing process has already become our best-selling album of all time.","Disney's Frozen has been huge for us all year, and is positioned to be one of the most popular licensed brands at Target this holiday season with 600 frozen products, 60 exclusive to Target across 20 categories.","For the holidays we are partnering with Ren\u00e9e Ehrlich Kalfus, costume designer for the contemporized Annie film to offer guests a limited edition collection of kids' apparel and accessories inspired by the film. Annie for Target will be available through December 26th or while supplies last at all US Target stores and on target.com. The film debuts in theaters nationwide on December 19th.","In beauty we continue to experience strong growth in natural products and we are constantly on the lookout for new lines that we appeal to our guests. We have already launched 7 premium skincare brands this year and we are thrilled to announce that two more super-luxe lines are on the way available now on target.com and in select stores. In March 2015 Target is adding S.W. Basics of Brooklyn and Nuxe to its lineup of premium skincare products.","All new in beauty, Skinfix, experts in steroid-free skin healing solutions for the whole family debuted its incredibly effective product exclusively at all US Target stores and online at target.com. Skinfix products are based on an original formula created over 150 years ago by pharmacist Thomas Dickson in Yorkshire, England.","And in hair care we are seeing continued momentum in natural with our Made to Matter products and we are excited about recently added salon products like Proganix from Vogue and exclusives like Procter and Gamble's hair food and L'Oreal's Dessange.","In healthcare, we announced earlier this week that Target and Kaiser Permanente are teaming up to launch four Target clinics in Southern California. For the first time at Target, guests will have access to expanded services not typically available in retail clinics, including pediatric and adolescent care, well woman care, family planning and management of chronic conditions like diabetes, and high blood pressure.","And coming in 2015, our new pharmacy app, Target Healthful, will allow guest to organize and transfer prescriptions, check prescription status, and order refills.","And finally of course, we are designing our marketing plans to bring the entire holiday season together from amazing products to outstanding deals. Our holiday marketing campaign is designed to encourage people of all ages to let loose, get into the spirit and feel the unmistakable joy of the holiday season.","The advertising will boldly embrace the iconic elements that make Target, Target. Lots of red, white and our lovable mascot Bullseye. The campaign will include broadcast, radio, out of home and catalogues and we are increasing digital media support by 50% over last year.","Target stores will be transformed with fun and whimsical in-store decor created in partnership with David Stark, one of the top event planners. This year we are partnering with innovative New York retailer STORY which brings an editorial lens to retail and reinvents itself every four to eight weeks from merchandise and store design to floor plans and fixtures, bringing to life a new theme or trend. From Target's design partnerships to its everyday collections, STORY has curated its favorite holiday treasures from Target alongside its other must-have items for the season.","We just launched our kids Wish List app on October 31st, a modern and digital take on the classic tradition of creating holiday wish lists for parents and kids. Kids can add must-have items to their list, while parents can share the list with friends and family, plus guests can save 10% on their wish lists on one day of their choosing before November 26th.","Through the holiday shopping season, Cartwheel, Target's industry leading savings app will offer daily deals for its more than 11 million users. And from November 2nd to December 24th, it will feature 50% off, a different joy everyday. The app will have new features for the holidays including special deals for top users, personalized recommendations, and a select number of popular offers that don't expire. As always REDcard holders get 5% off nearly all purchases, free shipping at target.com and an extra 30 days for returns. Since 5% REDcard rewards rolled out in 2010, Target has saved guests more than $2 billion and we will thank guests for their loyalty with perks throughout the holiday season.","We know our guests are pulled in a million different directions as the holidays get underway, so we are helping them save time and money by offering more access to Black Friday deals. Whether shopping online, on their phone or in our stores, Target guests will find Black Friday deals on top guests throughout November. We already offered early access to Black Friday deals for one-day only on November 10th. We've announced a presale on Wednesday, November 26th, and Cartwheel will feature access to additional Black Friday deals between November 23rd and November 29th.","On Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday deals will be available first in the morning on target.com, then at 6 pm, Target stores will open for Black Friday shoppers and the first several 100 guests will receive a Christmas cracker, gift synonymous with the holidays in many parts of the world which will include a Target gift card or coupon.","On Black Friday, from 6 am to noon, guest can purchase up to $300 in Target gift cards at a 10% off at Target stores and target.com, the first time Target has ever offered a discount on Target gift card purchases. The following day additional Saturday only deals will be available in Target stores and at target.com.","And finally beginning Monday December 1st, guests will find new deals everyday at target.com as part of Target's largest ever cyber week sale with more than 100,000 items on sales throughout the week. The offers will include category-wide sales in key gifting areas and steep discount on apparel, toys and housewares. More information and deals will be available at the end of November.","As we look back at an eventful year, we are pleased with the steps we have taken to improve our performance in both the US and Canada, and our financial results show that we are making meaningful progress. While there is much more work to be done, we are confident in our plans for the upcoming holiday shopping season, and pleased with our progress in -- charting a longer-term course for the Target of the future.","Now I will turn it over to John, who will share his insights on our third quarter financial performance and our fourth quarter outlook. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks Kathee. Our third quarter financial performance was better than expected driven by stronger than expected sales and operating margin performance in our US segment. Adjusted EPS of $0.54 was $0.02 or 2.9% below last year reflecting a decline in US segment profit partially offset by the benefit of reduced losses in our Canadian segment.","GAAP EPS of $0.55 was $0.01 or 2.7% higher than last year benefiting from the resolution of tax matters in the quarter. Our third quarter US comparable sales increase of 1.2% matches our best performance in the last two years.","Digital sales in the US including flexible fulfillment grew more than 30% contributing about 60 basis points to our US comparable sales. With ship-from-store capabilities now fully in place, we expect digital sales growth to accelerate to nearly 40% in the fourth quarter.","Our third quarter US segment EBITDA margin rate of 8.5% was ahead of our expectations driven by a better than expected SG&A expense rate of 21% which is about 20 basis points lower than last year. This performance was the result of our expense optimization efforts, better leverage on stronger than expected sales, and retiming of some expenses into the fourth quarter.","US REDcard penetration was 21% in the third quarter, up about 110 basis points from last year driven by growth in both credit and debit penetration. As we described last quarter, applications for new REDcard debit cards are running below last year causing penetration growth to decelerate from last year's pace. We believe this trend will continue in the fourth quarter when we expect US REDcard penetration will be flat or up slightly compared with last year.","With the success of recent initiatives designed to increase REDcard applications, we expect the fourth quarter will mark the low point in year-over-year penetration growth after which we should see a reacceleration in 2015.","In our Canadian segment, third quarter sales were below our expectations growing 44% above last year reflecting sales from new stores and a comparable sales increase of 1.6%. As I mentioned last quarter, the comparable sales metric in Canada will be noisy until we fully annualize the rapid pace of last year's store rollout. Given the sustained grand opening surges we experienced in those stores and the densification around early cycle stores that occurred later in 2013.","REDcard penetration continues to grow in the Canadian segment reaching 4.2% in the third quarter compared with 2.9% last year. As expected third quarter Canadian segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates improved somewhat from last year, and EBIT dollar losses were about 18% lower than a year ago. While this improvement is encouraging, financial results in this segment remain unacceptable. And as Brian mentioned earlier we need to see a significant step change in Canadian segment financial performance.","Outside of operating results in the US and Canada, our third quarter GAAP EPS of $0.55 reflects a few items not included in adjusted EPS. Specifically, $0.05 of accretion related to the resolution of income tax matters and $0.04 of offsetting dilution from data breach related costs, reduction in beneficial interest asset and impairment losses.","Moving to consolidated metrics, third quarter interest expense was flat to last year, and we paid $330 million in dividends in the quarter, and increase of 21% over last year. As expected we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter. And given current performance and our goal to maintain our single 'A' debt ratings, we don't anticipate any share repurchase in the fourth quarter as well. Of course the timing and magnitude of any future share repurchase activity will depend on the pace of improved financial performance in both the US and Canada.","Before I move to our outlook, I want to first address our inventory, which at quarter end was about 7% above last year. This increase was entirely driven by our US segment and was the result of two factors. While a third of this increase relates to our recent efforts to reduce out-of-stocks on commodity products, while the remainder reflects receipt timing including the impact of our efforts to manage around slowdown at West Coast ports. Bottomline, we feel very good about our current US inventory level. ","Now let's move to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As we consider the broader environment, we see some encouraging signs including lower gas prices than we've seen in some time. However consumer spending patterns remain quite volatile, and we expect the competitive environment will remain highly promotional this holiday season.","Based on this backdrop and the Q3 to Q4 expense retirement I covered earlier we are continuing to plan cautiously and maintaining our prior full-year guidance despite stronger than expected third quarter performance.","In the US we are expecting a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of about 2%. So far in November, we are running ahead of our forecast but I will quickly remind everyone that the bulk of the season remains ahead of us.","We expect our fourth quarter US gross margin rate will improve somewhat from a year ago. Last year in the US, we faced unexpected gross margin headwinds because of the data breach including the pre-Christmas weekend in which we gave our guests 10% off every transaction along with incremental clearance markdowns resulting from softer sales.","So while we expect the typical year-over-year gross margin pressure from an intensely promotional and highly competitive fourth quarter, we believe that pressure will be more than offset by the benefit from annualizing last year's breach related markdowns.","We expect our US segment SG&A expense rate to be flat to down slightly from last year as the benefit from expense optimization and better leverage on a 2% comp is expected to be offset by the timing of expenses which moved from the third to the fourth quarter. Altogether, our outlook is for the US segment EBITDA margin rate to improve 50 to 60 basis points compared with last year.","In Canada, we expect a high single digit increase in total sales driven by a mid-to-high single digit increase in comparable sales. We expect the gross margin rate of around 20% much better than last year's 4% rate which resulted from extreme clearance activity and reserves taken on excess inventory.","With an expected SG&A expense rate of between 35% and 40%, we anticipate fourth quarter Canadian segment EBITDA losses of about $100 million, an improvement of about $160 million compared with last year.","Turning to consolidated metrics, we expect a small increase in fourth quarter interest expense compared with last year. And for the first time this year, we expect our tax expense to be higher than last year in light of the expected improvement in profitability.","Altogether these expectations will lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.13 to $1.23 well above the $0.90 we earned last year. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS is expected to include $0.02 of dilution from the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any future data breach expenses which are not expected to be material.","For the full year, the center of our adjusted EPS expectation remains at $3.20. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 lower than adjusted EPS reflecting a variety of adjustments including debt retirement and breach related expenses.","Fourth quarter will mark a notable inflexion point as we annualize the data breach and expect to see the first year-over-year increase in operating profit this year. This would provide clear financial evidence of the healing process we've been engaged in throughout the year, and we look forward to entering next year with an energized team and positive momentum in our financial performance.","With that we will conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sean Naughton from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sean Naughton","","Good morning, and thank for taking the question. So John, you mentioned there has been a lot of talk about gas prices and the potential positive benefit on the consumer. But just curious if you could speak to the potential benefit you may receive on the P&L from a distribution standpoint? And if those are savings that are there, how would you guys look to use those additional distribution savings between flowing through to earnings and potentially reinvesting to drive traffic?","John Mulligan","Yeah, I think a couple of things. Certainly there would likely be some benefits if we continue to see fuel prices come down, but we haven't reached the threshold where fuel surcharges begin to come out of our contracts and I think importantly given the great work the team has done to manage some of the port issues out west, we are working around that and moving some freight further, expediting some freight, flying some freight, and I think net-net, that will probably be more of a drag than any fuel savings we will see.","Sean Naughton","","So \u2013 and then I just guess just the second question on the overall basket, the UPT continues to be -- to decline and actually looks like it'll decelerate a little bit on a two-year basis. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color around that particular dynamic either at the store level perspective given the higher food concentration I would be expecting that to improve but maybe this is being offset by online? And I guess the follow-up would be is how do you improve that dynamic moving forward? Thanks.","Kathee Tesija","Yeah, Sean, this is Kathee. It's predominantly a mix story for us. So we have higher ticket items like all the Apple products including the launch of the iPhone 6 in the quarter. We've got video game consoles that are higher, we have a lot of trade-up strategies both in inessentials like you talked about like in grocery with organics, but also in areas like skin care which I described a little bit earlier. So this is really a mix story.","Sean Naughton","","So it's less about the shift between online and store at this [point in time] [ph].","Kathee Tesija","Correct. Yeah.","Sean Naughton","","Thank you, and best of luck for the holiday.","John Mulligan","Thank you, Sean.","Operator","You next question comes from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo.","Matt Nemer","Good morning and congrats on improved US results. My first question is on expenses in the US. They've basically been running flat on a dollar basis this year, down a little bit per foot. I am wondering if you can get into a little more detail on what's driving the cost savings, and then in terms of the outlook, is this a line that you think you can run flat to up in dollars, up slightly in dollars over the next year or so or should we expect it to grow a little faster than that.","John Mulligan","Hi Matt. Yeah, I think the expense savings I would tell you, we've talked about the expense optimization efforts all year, been very focused on that and has been across the entire enterprise and we've seen good news in SG&A and also in the cost of goods. There are a couple of areas I would point out the stores performance has been outstanding driving productivity increases while still continuing to remain very strong guest service scores, frankly our guest service scores historically, so we have seen great performance there. And then it's just really many other areas. There's been great work done in marketing around the circular. There's been great work done in our transportation and how we optimize our network of transportation. So really across the enterprise. I think importantly to your question about [Indiscernible], we believe there continues to be significant opportunity for us to continue to take expense out and so for the foreseeable future we would expect to continue to see expenses very well controlled and to lever expenses at really -- relatively modest increases in sales.","Brian Cornell","And it's Brian. And to build on John's point, and as I discussed in my prepared comments, as we move forward, we recognize that we are going to continue to need to focus on expense management to fuel the investments we are going to make to drive continued growth across our store base and our digital platform.","So as we come back to you in the spring and we talk more specifically about our strategy, you should expect us to continue to talk about cost optimization efforts and how we will use those efforts to reinvest in the fuel that's going to drive our growth.","Matt Nemer","Okay, that's great. And then secondly on target.com, I wanted to ask a question about the free shipping program. Does the incremental volume offset the incremental shipping expense? Is it profit accretive? And do you think that the customers that are utilizing this offer are high life time value customers?","Kathee Tesija","Yeah, it's not accretive. I will tell you we do ship even prior to the holiday free shipping. We do free ship a lot more than perhaps you would think and certainly more than some of our competitors given REDcard and the fact that that ships free all year round.","So we have seen -- we know it's the number one frustration with our guests and the number one reason for abandoned cards. And so it was important for us this holiday season to be able to take that friction away and we have seen meaningful move in orders and conversion because of it. So we are very pleased with the result so far.","John Mulligan","Yeah, Matt, the only thing I\u2019d add while not accretive -- the only thing I would add is it\u2019s not material either to our results in the fourth quarter.","Matt Nemer","Okay, very helpful. Best of luck this holiday.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Thank you, and congrats. Regarding the -- the great idea regarding signature categories and where you are focusing there, how would you help us just prioritize which categories have the most opportunities in terms of lead time and revenue mix and timing of impact? And is the extrapolation there that traffic will be the biggest kind of comp upside driver as you do focus on these categories? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Yeah, Oliver I think as we go forward, and as Kathee and the team really elevate our focus around those signature categories, categories like baby and kids, wellness and style, you should expect to see additional focus in store. You should see additional innovation, partnerships. But really ensuring that we are leading with trend, we are anticipating what our guest is looking for in those categories, and those are categories that Target becomes famous for. And we are certainly going to double down our efforts in those categories because our guest has asked us to. There are categories that are very important to our guest. They are synonymous with the Target experience the guest is expecting. And you will see signs of that as we move into 2015 and beyond. Certainly some of the work that Kathee and her team have done in preparation for the fourth quarter are already bringing our efforts to life in apparel. Some of the things that we have done in home, the partnerships that Kathee talked about in her prepared comments, our continued focus on baby and kids and we know how important toys are during the holiday season. So we are already making progress in those spaces.","But I also want to make sure it's really clear that does not mean we are walking away from other categories in our stores. They just play a different role in our future strategy and there'll continue to be areas where we are going to look to improve our execution and performance. But from a prioritization standpoint we think those signature categories that we\u2019ve talked about are key to the guests. The guest has told us those are critically important to them and Kathee and her team are working rapidly to ensure that we continue to build our position, enhance our assortment, and bring great newness and innovation to those key categories.","Kathee Tesija","So a couple of things I would add to that you will already see in stores right now. Brian talked about those four areas, baby, kids, wellness and style. So in baby, about 200 stores have a new presentation where we have invested in labor in the stores to help guests create registry and gift givers find the perfect gift.","We have added mannequins and things that help the presentation. I also chaired today the registry that we have redone completely - the whole experience from the in-store hardware to the software that we use and how that helps guests create registries much easier. We are already seeing the benefit of that.","Wellness, we have talked a lot about Made to Matter, and better for you products. So you see that already this year. And then in style just to touch on that for a minute, we now have about 650 stores that have our new presentation in apparel including mannequins. So already some progress and we will continue to push forward in those areas and you will see more and more as the months and year goes on.","Brian Cornell","Oliver, the final point I'd add, as we think about style. Certainly apparel and home are critically important in that space but so is beauty. And as John and Kathee have referenced, we use one of our standout categories in the third quarter and we expect continued strong performance as we exit the year.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. And just as a follow-up that's related. There seems to be a lot of energized agility Brian regarding -- thinking about what Target stands for from a bigger picture perspective. What are some of the initial thoughts on where you see that opportunity as you work to further differentiate and innovate yourself?","Brian Cornell","Oliver, I think, we are making progress across a number of different areas. Certainly we talked about omni-channel, and really making sure that we are a significant player in this space. We are seeing very strong performance up over 30% in the third quarter. John talked about that that we expect that performance to accelerate in Q4. We clearly took away the pain point of shipping by announcing free ship in the fourth quarter and we think that's another way for the [indiscernible] to declare we are significantly committed to this space.","We are seeing a great response to Cartwheel and have 11 million users today, and we are going to use that to make sure that we use digital as the front door to connect to the target brand going forward.","We talked about some of the progress that's being made in merchandising and we've got 35,000 new items in stores for the holiday. And we are going to continue to test and partner as we continue to make sure we are bringing the right solutions to our guests.","If you haven't seen some of the holiday creative, I think it's some of the best Target\u2019s delivered in years and I am getting emails and comments from guests and friends and people I know everyday talking about their reaction to the holiday creative and how the curative campaign it's uniquely Target. And we are certainly upping our game both in-store. But we are also going to spend significantly more in digital this year to touch our guests no matter how they are connecting with the brand.","In-store we have made significant progress in a very short period of time going from testing, ship-from-store, to now we are in 38 markets, 136 stores where our stores are acting like flexible fulfillment centers. You can shop there, you can pick up there, but they are also shipping to -- directly to our guests. And allows us to cover 90% of our marketplace in a very short period of time. Takes the pain away from that last mile.","So I think you are going to continue to see us make these points and that's a sneak peak of Target in the future. And I think that is creating positive energy in the organization.","Kathee and I are hearing really positive things from our vendors. Our organization knows we got to be more -- we got to show more agility, we got to be responsive, we got to make sure we are externally focused in following the guest. I think you are seeing some of those things take shape today.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Thank you very much. Best regards for the holidays.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","You next question comes from Wayne Hood from BMO Capital.","Wayne Hood","Yeah Kathee, I have questions, maybe a little bit longer terms in places of the context of how you evolve a company and that is related to where you see AUR trending because you are talking about more of this is in kids and baby which typically is lower ticket and maybe pulling back on promotions and electronics because that's not cooler. I am just wondering where you think you are AUR might land over the next few years in light of kind of 2% to 3% growth you've been experiencing under the existing strategy. And then if you could talk about -- John, if you could talk about the growth in inventory next year and its impact on working capital as you think about being better in stock on the ad merchandise and the like? Thank you.","Kathee Tesija","We haven't modeled exactly what that will be yet. But I would tell you I think it will be moving up for a couple of reasons. So you heard Brian talk about those areas that we are going to focus on and really being famous for them in delighting our guests. And when we are at our best we offer both expect more pay less together in all of these categories and that means a really thoughtful balance of good better best having clear features and benefits as we move up that ladder allowing guests to be able to buy whatever is important to them but importantly offering really good trade-up opportunities. So you are seeing some of that right now in some categories. But I think as we move forward, and we become famous again for some of these categories, there will be a lot of trade up opportunities.","So I would say overall, seeing it moving up.","Brian Cornell","And Wayne, your second question, inventory, I think, the one thing I would say if you look at our number this quarter, 6% to 7%, all the US, really only about a third of that do we view as temporary. The vast majority of that was receipt timing. But that curve we expect to stay around; we started that in second quarter this year. We will cycle it again next year in second quarter somewhere around 2% to 3% increase for the first half and next year. But offsetting that ultimately as we start to get back to positive comp sales, we should see faster turn and that should ultimately lead to better payables leverage.","So not a meaningful impact overall once we get past fourth quarter here on our working capital.","Wayne Hood","Right. Thank you.","Operator","You next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Thanks. I have two questions that are maybe a little bit linked. John if we start on dotcom which if my [indiscernible] writes around 2.5% of sales in the quarter. What does that do to the margin going forward? I know you mentioned it sort of immaterial for the fourth quarter but tell us what it did in the third quarter and how we should think about it? I mean it's probably dilutive of some effect and whether it's more in gross margin or SG&A? And then I had a follow-up.","John Mulligan","On margin, it's definitely dilutive, Greg, if for no other reason in the shipping expense. And I think as it continues to grow, that will put margin pressure on the P&L and we've talked a little bit about this. There are lots of puts and takes in gross margin as we think about it going forward that we're working through today. As that business grows, it will be margin dilutive. But as we increase penetration of ship-from-store and pickup in-store that significantly not only improves our guest experience, but significantly improves the P&L.","We're also balancing how we look at pricing right now and balancing inventories across the network as we ship from store. So some of those are up, some of those are down. And we're working through right now where ultimately gross margin will land.","Greg Melich","And then the follow-up, and maybe Brian, you -- in your comments, you talked about making sure in the five-key operating principles, that invest to build capabilities. I love your perspective on -- this year CapEx is down a lot and we're running I guess a little over $2 billion as the run rate. What do you think is the CapEx need sort of going forward to invest in what Target really needs to do to be the best it can be?","Brian Cornell","Greg, we're assessing that right now as we think about 2015 and beyond. But you should expect us to be investing in the capability to continue to build out our digital experience, to continue to enhance our in-store experience, to make sure we have the analytical tools to properly manage expenses and margin even more surgically going forward. And I talked about -- while certainly in the early stages, we're going to continue to look at smaller formats and how we use smaller formats to penetrate urban markets, allow our guest a chance to interact with the Target brand both in-store, but also continue to build out the opportunity for them to purchase online.","So we're in the early stages of assessing our long-term capital needs, but you should expect us to be investing in the right capabilities and tool to provide long-term shareholder value and allow us to continue to fuel our growth and enhance both margins and continue to manage operating expenses effectively.","Greg Melich","Would that mean CapEx would be above D&A at some point in the future or do you think you can stay below that?","John Mulligan","Greg, we think -- at least Brian said I think with the caveat that we're working through this right now, we think we're probably in about the right range right now. The spend may move around a little bit. I think the one wild card is the point Brian made about small formats. But I would note that obviously the investment there is significantly below what a prototypical Target would look like. So it would take a lot of those to meaningfully move our CapEx number. So like we've talked about something in for the US in that $2 billion -- $2.5 billion range still makes sense, but we're doing the work right now.","Greg Melich","That's great. Thanks a lot. Good luck for holiday.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","","Thanks a lot and good morning. I know there's a lot of big picture questions to discuss, but actually I have two quantitative ones related to the quarter. First of all, John, can you talk about the expense, the magnitude of the expense dollars that shifted from the third quarter to the fourth and talk about perhaps functionally speaking what they're related to?","John Mulligan","Yeah, most of it is marketing moved around. And the magnitude, if you think about us beating by somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.09, is a little bit less than half the beat. So somewhere in that $30 million to $40 million moved between the quarters.","Matthew Fassler","","Got it. Thanks for that. And then secondly, you talked about running ahead of the fourth quarter plan. Just as we think about the cadence of that plan, obviously you had a tough January as did many retailers particularly given the breach. So when you say running ahead, is that running ahead of the 2% number as we speak or running ahead of a plan that's maybe a bit more nuanced than that as we think about where we are in the progression of the quarter and your compares a year ago?","John Mulligan","Well, I wouldn't want to get into that level of detail. Clearly, last year pre-breach was stronger than post-breach, and we took that into account as we thought about the calendarization of the plan, and right now we're running ahead of that and we feel good about where we're at, not only relative to the plan, but on an absolute basis is what I'd say. But there is a lot of business left to be done before we get to the end of January.","Matthew Fassler","","Got it. Thank you for both of those, appreciate it.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Your final question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's on the food category. And recognizing you're not going to deemphasize it, you're just going to streamline it, how are you thinking about the return profile of that space within the store? And then could there be any differences in amongst how space is allocated, could that area get less over time?","Brian Cornell","Yeah, and let's drop back and make sure we clarify our point on the food category. We have no intentions today to streamline those categories. But Kathee and the team are certainly stepping back, listening to the guests, really understanding what the Target guest is looking for in food. From an assortment standpoint, from a newness standpoint, we talked about the fact that as we go forward, you should expect to see more natural and organic offerings. We've seen a terrific response from the guests, it's something that we call Made to Matter, a collection of items that are on trend for our Target guest, feature a number of exclusive items that Target from manufacturers that are in the organic and natural space, that can bring great innovation, gluten-free, on-trend products to our guests. And we certainly recognize that we have an opportunity to connect with the guests in a different way when it comes to food. But you shouldn't expect us to deemphasize those categories. That's not the point. We're not streamlining our food offering, but we are stepping back and really listening to the guest, making sure we curate on their behalf the right items that are uniquely Target that meet the needs of our guests in the food categories.","So a lot more to come as we talk about this in the first quarter, but to make sure we're really clear, we're not streamlining food. We're not de-emphasizing food, we're not walking away from food. But we certainly want to make sure we put our mark on the food category with items that are uniquely Target, that are right for our guests, that are on trend, and you should certainly expect to see more natural, organic offerings in that space because the Target guest has asked for them.","Michael Lasser","Okay, that's very helpful. And you think you can manage the return profile on that space to certainly meet the hurdle lights that you expect from it?","Brian Cornell","We would certainly expect to see that, and Kathee talked about some of the changes we're seeing in mix. And certainly when we talk about natural organic, when we talk about some of these unique items, they tend to have a higher average unit rank.","So you should expect to see some mix changes, but importantly, food is an important part of our future. We're not going to deemphasize the category, we're not looking to take away space. We want it to be more impactful, more on trend, and we want to fill it with items that the Target guest is looking for.","Michael Lasser","Okay, that's very helpful. And good luck with the rest of the holiday.","Brian Cornell","Thank you, appreciate it.","John Hulbert","That concludes Target's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on Target\u2019s second quarter performance and our plans and priorities going forward. Following their remarks, we will open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and return on invested capital, which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS from continuing operations and to our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning\u2019s press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our second quarter performance and our priorities going forward. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which gives us increased confidence that we are focused on the right long-term strategy. Our team is energized and remains on track to deliver the ambitious agenda we laid out for the year, including the physical transformation more than 100 stores in 2017. On the way to transforming, more than 600 stores over a 3-year period, nearly doubling the number of small format stores are shared in support of our goal to open more than 100 new stores in dense urban, suburban and college campus neighborhoods over a 3-year period.","Development and rollout of digital capabilities that will continue to drive Target\u2019s digial sales growth in excess of the industry, completely transforming our supply chain from end-to-end creating a smart network of stores and distribution facilities that will allow fast reliable fulfillment regardless of how our guests use the shop, rejuvenating our own brand portfolio by launching 12 brands over a 2-year period, replacing brands that represent more than $10 billion of our current sales volume, investing in systems, training and additional labor hours in our source enabling our team to provide an even better experience for our guests and enhancing our value perception among consumers by reducing promotions and highlighting the right everyday pricing in key categories. Later in the call, John, Mark and Cathy will provide more details on our efforts to advance each of these priorities.","On our last conference call, I mentioned that beyond our focus on advancing our long-term priorities, we need to have equal focus on strong execution in every channel, everyday. That\u2019s why we are really proud of the execution by our team in the second quarter as they delivered better-than-expected performance in a continuing challenging environment. In particular, second quarter traffic, which was up more than 2% was much stronger than our expectations and better than recent trends and the strength was broad-based across the country, across categories and across channels. And while the consumer and competitive environment remains choppy better-than-expected performance occurred throughout the quarter and wasn\u2019t limited to a short period within the quarter, with better second quarter traffic, we saw improved performance across each of our 5 broad merchandising categories: apparel, home, food and beverage, essentials and hardlines. 4 of those 5 saw comp increases in the second quarter, while comp sales in food and beverage were flat. However, given continued competitive and deflationary pressure in food, we are pleased that we are seeing early signs of progress. Specifically, we saw really strong positive comps in adult beverages and produce in the second quarter, both categories in which we have identified opportunities and focused on improvement. The positive response from our guests demonstrates that we are making progress and we are taking additional steps to build on that momentum over time.","I also want to call out our progress on pricing and promotions. As we mentioned in the last call, we undertook this effort with a long-term view knowing that we might create some headwinds in the near term. Specifically, as we move towards a stronger everyday price proposition in our business and pullback on excess promotions, we can expect an adjustment period before value perception proves and consumers respond. While we continue to face the risk in future quarters as we expand the scope of this work, it\u2019s notable that in the second quarter we saw a meaningful increase in the percent of our business done at regular price and a meaningful decline in the percent on promotion. This demonstrates the progress we have already made and gives us confidence we are on the right track.","I also want to call out the team\u2019s progress on Target\u2019s digital capabilities which continue to show up in our results. Target\u2019s digital sales grew much faster than industry in the second quarter, up 32% on top of 16% growth last year. If you do the compounding of these two growth rates, you will see that this represents more than a 50% growth rate compared with 2 years ago. And importantly as a result of our comprehensive effort by our team to reduce friction and increase the reliability of our digital operations, we have seen meaningful declines in guest contact center activity related to digital. This is a tangible reflection of our work to create a stable digital platform and successful collaboration between our digital operations and merchandising teams to create a more cohesive experience for our guests.","To build on this success the team is rapidly testing and rolling out additional fulfillment options for our guests. This includes Target Restock, our next day delivery option for everyday essentials that we recently rolled out the Twin City Red Card holders. It includes same day delivery which we began testing in our Tribeca store in the second quarter. It includes an early test of curbside fulfillment which we recently began testing with Twin City team members and which will expand to again facing tests in the third quarter. And of course our efforts include the expansion of ship and store locations, in-store pickup capabilities and our work with third-party providers to speed up ship times from our stores and distribution facilities. In each of these efforts the team is moving quickly, more quickly than ever before to rollout, test and iterate and expand where we see positive results. We are really excited to see the engagement of our team and the collaboration occurring across our operations which allows these tests to move quickly and we intend to continue moving quickly in the months ahead.","Another area where we have increased our speed is the development and rollout of new exclusive brands with last year\u2019s rollout of Pillowfort and Cat & Jack in kids we demonstrated the power of reinvention in categories that were already performing well. Specifically both of these new brands grow double digit comps following their launch last year. Regarding the Cat & Jack brand, we have long said that it was on pace to exceed $1 billion in sales in its first year. The performance has actually exceeded those expectations. Cat & Jack just crossed the $2 billion mark only slightly more than a year after its launch. Based on the success of those brands, our team took on the ambitious goal of launching 12 additional new brands before the end of next year and those plans are coming to life.","At the end of May we launched Cloud Island, an infant brand which we developed in partnership with our guests. And like last year\u2019s new brands Cloud Island has generated double digit comp increases in the period since the launch. In July we launched a new maternity brand Isabel Maternity and announced plans to launch four more brands in the third quarter crossing women\u2019s apparel, men\u2019s apparel and home. I also want to comment on our recently announced decision to partner with Casper in advance of the back to college season. I spent some time with the leadership team at Casper and I have been really impressed with how they think long-term and focus on outstanding execution on behalf of their customers. Their brand and products are a great fit with the Target brands and we are proud to be featuring their products online and in our stores, including a couple of exclusive items they have developed only for Target. This relationship is the most recent example of our ability to differentiate our assortment while helping outstanding brands to extend their reach.","During this period of rapid transformation in retail in which many others are shrinking, we will continue to look for ways to partner and deliver incremental growth for high quality brands while delivering differentiation and value for our guests. As we look ahead, we are committed to continued progress against our long-term goals. And we expect the environment will continue to be challenging. The pace of change in the consumer and competitive environment doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down. And we are well positioned to emerge as one of the winners in retail. It starts with the underlying health of our business, a business that generated profits of nearly $700 million in the second quarter. Our business is backed by amazing assets including our team, our network of stores and distribution centers, our unique merchandise assortment and a deeper relationship with our guest. Beyond those assets we have a very strong balance sheet and operations that generate a lot of cash providing us the flexibly to undertake the ambitious 3-year transformation we first laid out at our analyst meeting in February. And we continue to look for ways to move faster.","In February, we announced our plans to complete 250 store transformations in 2018 on top of the 100 plus we are on track to complete this year. However, based on our success so far and the hard work of our real estate and construction teams to grow our capabilities quickly, we now believe we can accomplish more than 300 store remodels next year. While the scope of our transformation is large we remain focused on what has made Target an outstanding retailer over the long-term, all the way back to our first store in 1962. The key for us is embracing the power of ant which makes us unique among our competitive set. When we are at our best our model delivers the best of both mass and specialty retail. We deliver inspiration and convenience and we invite our guest to expect more and pay less. Because we delivered on all of those dimensions over time, we have developed a unique emotional relationship with our guests and we believe that relationship is positioned to thrive in the new era of retail.","If we continue to offer our guests inspiration and aspiration, differentiate merchandise and experiences and deliver convenience, reliability and great everyday prices we will continue to stand out and succeed in a crowded retail environment. One way to see how the best the Target comes together is a visit one of our exciting new small format stores we have been opening across the country. I visited our new store that recently opened on the USC campus and despite my loyalty as a proud UCLA graduate I couldn\u2019t help being excited by what I saw. The store is already quite busy even though most of the students have yet to return from summer break duty, baby, food and beverage are all selling well. And the store team is quickly evolving their assortment based on feedback from a diverse set of guests, it\u2019s truly inspiring to see the team interact with our new guests and an exciting new shopping environment and I am proud of what they do every day.","So now I would like to turn the call over to the team who will provide additional detail on our strategic plans and recent performance. First John will provide detail on our work and supply chain and our stores to enhance our fulfillment capabilities and provide a more reliable and inspirational experience for our guests. Then Mark will cover category performance and provide more detail on our recent and upcoming brand launches. Finally, Cathy will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and expectations for the rest of the year.","So with that I will turn the call over to John for his comments. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks Brian. Across all the operations team, we are focused on modernizing Target\u2019s network to create a complete seamless efficient and reliable menu of fulfillment options for our guests. And while we are still in the early stages of a multi-year journey, the team continues to move with unprecedented speed developing skills and processes that allow us to develop, test and iterate much more quickly than we have in the past. Some of our fulfillment capabilities are already well developed and in those cases the team is focused on finding ways to increase our speed, reliability and reach. At the other end of the spectrum, we are in the early stages of testing completely new fulfillment options for our guests. In those situations the work is fully focused on learning from our guests and vendor partners, understanding what is most important to our guests and beginning to evaluate reliable, repeatable processes that will allow Target to fulfill guests rapidly evolving needs and expectations.","Among our more developed fulfillment capabilities, we have offered in-store pickup of digital orders across all of our locations for years, but we continue to find opportunities to improve execution and we are seeing and continued momentum. Specifically through the first half of the year store pickup volume has grown more than 30% above last year and in July we saw more than 40% growth. As more and more of our guests respond to the convenience of order pickup, we are investing in system enhancements and store labor hours to continue to elevate the guest experience. These investments will be especially important in the fourth quarter holiday season when guests are particularly time pressured and rely on this fulfillment option even more frequently.","Another way we can enhance the pickup experience is to offer a drive up option, so guests don\u2019t need to leave their cars. And in second quarter we launched the new test of the service, unlike the past when we partnered with third-party to offer this service this new test is being implemented with our own team members and internally developed technology. The offer applies to approximately 180,000 shelf stable items currently eligible for in-store pickup. And in the early stages, we are offering it only to team members in a handful of Twin City stores. However, based on our early results from the test, we expect to move to a guest facing pilot and select Twin Cities locations later in the fall.","While the capability for our stores to ship digital orders directly to guest homes was also launched 2 years ago, we are seeing even more rapid growth in this fulfillment mode. For the first half of the year ship from store sales are only about twice as high as last year, accounted for more than 40% of digital units shipped. Since the rollout of this capability we have added new ship from store locations every year. In this fall we plan to roll it out to another 350 stores in advance of the holiday season. This will bring the total number of ship from store locations to more than 1,400 stores. In addition, we are creating additional capacity by ramping up the order volume running through our mature ship from store locations. Because so many of our stores can now ship directly to guests, we have been able to increase delivery speed while still controlling costs and that in turn has allowed us to offer new fulfillment options like Target Restock.","This service allows guest to order a shopping cart size box filled with items chosen from an assortment of more than 15,000 essential items like coffee and paper towels and have it shipped to their house for a fixed $4.99 delivery fee. Because these orders are fulfilled from a nearby store location, we can promise that any restock order placed before 2 PM will arrive at a guest home on the following weekday. You will recall that we rapidly developed this capability the team member test in the first quarter and we moved to the next stage of the test in the second quarter rolling out to Twin Cities Red Card holders in late June. Operationally, this guest facing test has gone well and as a result we just rolled out restock to the Dallas and Denver markets and we plan to expand into another seven markets before the holidays. With restock available in these 10 markets we will already be reaching one quarter of the U.S. market less than six months from the day we launched the test.","Beyond geographic expansion, we began offering restock to non-Red Card holders in all three test markets. We will be extending the delivery window by adding Saturday delivery and will move the cut off for next day delivery later beyond the current 2 PM cutoff. And given the strong store execution we have seen so far, we will begin ramping up communication and marketing efforts in restock markets which will increase awareness in order volume providing visibility into the capacity of our store team to reliably process higher order volumes. Beyond our internal fulfillment capabilities, our team is also working with transportation partners to improve the speed and cost efficiency of last mile delivery.","To supplement these efforts, this week we announced our decision to acquire Grand Junction, a San Francisco based transportation technology company. Grand Junction has developed proprietary technology tools and has relationships with more than 700 carriers, allowing retailers to choose the most efficient option for last mile delivery on an individual order. While this acquisition is not expected to have a material direct impact on our financial results, we are excited to bring Grand Junction into the Target team and believe their model will help accelerate our progress in delivering speed, efficiency and a high level of service to Target\u2019s last mile fulfillment. We worked with the Grand Junction team on the test of same day delivery in our Tribeca store which we launched in the second quarter. In this test, guests who check out can choose to have their purchased items delivered to their home on the same day in a delivery window of their choice.","We have been pleased with the results of the test and have gained some useful insights from the guest response to the offer. For example, the value of the average basket for these same day delivery orders is more than 6x the store average at the Tribeca store and contains nearly 4x the units compared with the stores typical basket. Also notable home is the most common category in same day delivery transactions, ahead of essentials and food and beverage. And importantly net promoter scores for the same day delivery service have been higher than for the Tribeca store overall demonstrating the quality of execution so far. Based on these encouraging initial results, we plan to expand the same day delivery test to several other New York City locations in the fall.","Of course the most common mode of shopping is still overwhelmingly in our stores. So while we are investing in new ways to leverage our stores for digital fulfillment, we are also investing to bring our great store shopping experience to guests across the country. This includes our remodel program in which we plan to transform the look and feel of more than 600 stores over a 3-year period. In support of this plan, we are on track to deliver more than 100 remodels in 2017. In the second quarter we completed 42 remodels, bringing us to a total of 63 so far this year. And while we are obviously seeing a range of outcomes on an individual store level, we are continuing to see average sales lists in line with our plan to deliver a 2% to 4% sales lift in remodel stores. And as Brian highlighted, the team is doing a great job of scaling up our capacity, which will enable a faster pace of remodels in 2018 than we previously expected. Beyond remodels, our team is delivering our plan to rollout more than 100 small format stores to dense urban, suburban and college campus environments over a 3-year period. For 2017, we are still on track to deliver our plan to add nearly 30 new small format stores. In July, we opened 9 new small stores across the country on top of the 4 we opened in the first quarter. While we have only been open a few weeks, our July openers have been particularly strong out of the gate.","And as Brian highlighted, the guest response had been phenomenal. For the 7 small format stores, they have been open for more than a year, we are continuing to see sales productivity more than double the company average and these stores have been delivering high single-digit comp increases so far in 2017. So, clearly, our team has been busy transforming our assets and developing new and more efficient ways to fulfill guest demand. But as Brian mentioned, we also need to focus on execution everyday. Even though strong execution may not always grab the headlines, it has a real impact on our performance. An outstanding example is our work to improve the fundamentals of our digital business, which has dramatically reduced the number of guest center contacts related to digital transactions.","Specifically in 2017, guest contacts per digital order are running 30% lower than last year. This dramatic reduction is the result of concerted effort by our team who looked end-to-end at the digital guest experience, all the way from our site and our apps to ordering, purchasing and fulfillment. Based on this foundational work, the team has worked methodically to reduce friction and pain points and you are seeing the benefit both in our contact statistics and in our digital traffic and sales.","Another example is our partnership with CVS. As we outlined last year, the conversion of pharmacies created some inevitable friction for our guests driving an initial decline in script count in our stores. Since the conversions began, we have been working closely with the CVS team to minimize the guest impact and build awareness of the benefits CVS can provide. As a result of our joint efforts, guest experience scores in our pharmacies have been climbing since the CVS conversion and are now running well ahead of our pre-conversion levels and we have been seeing the impact in our business.","In the second quarter, comparable pharmacy script counts turned positive for the first time in more than a year. While this is encouraging, we know we have more opportunities to build on this momentum and we are working with CVS on marketing and guest engagement plans for the fall season. Execution in our stores has been a big focus this year and we are investing in hours training and technology to our large store team members to elevate the shop experience. Depending on the stores volume and buying patterns, we are adding hours to enhance the order pickup experience. In our visual merchandising teams in apparel and home, in beauty and in food and beverage and given all the brand launches that Mark\u2019s team is planning for the fall, we have invested in training and materials to help our store team is best present and sell these new lines to our guests. Across all of our stores, we are asking the team to increase their engagement with guests and ensured they are finding all the items on their list. To support this effort, we are rolling out a new tool that will help our store teams locate items, colors and sizes not available in their store and allow them to sell those items directly to guests right on the sales floor. We are in the very early stages of rolling out this new capability and guest awareness is still low, but we are already getting some initial insights. Not surprisingly over half the activity on these devices has been related to apparel where the ability to find additional sizes and colors creates particular value for our guests.","So now before I close I want to give a nod to the team. I am incredibly proud of what they have already accomplished and I am energized by their passion to transform our operations in our business on behalf of our guests. And while I know I keep saying that we are just getting started it\u2019s also amazing to look back and realize how much we have already accomplished.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark who will provide more detail on our performance and plans and merchandising. Mark?","Mark Tritton","Thanks, John. As you have been hearing from many of the industry peers, this continues to be a challenging competitive and consumer environment. That\u2019s why we are particularly pleased by the ongoing progress we saw in the second quarter when we gained further momentum in the areas that we are already performing well and so improvement in the areas where performance needed more focus and our aggressive has come from both stores and digital channels, wherever our guests wants to shop us. From market share perspective, we saw broad-based market share gains across all ad discretionary categories. In hardlines, comparable sales grew between 3% and 4% in the second quarter, the strongest performance we have seen in 10 years. Growth in this area was broad-based including double-digit growth in both videogames driven by Nintendo switch and Apple within electronics. Toys grew more than 3% with board games continuing to be a strong highlight. This is an area where we already enjoy a leading market share position, but continue to grow and take further share due to our focus on innovation and differentiation within our assortment.","Our apparel and home categories both grew sales and market share in these tough markets. In apparel, growth was widespread across subcategories as guests responded to fashion and newness all underpinned by value through great price right daily items. We were particularly pleased with the ongoing positive performance in kids, which continues to benefit from last year\u2019s launch of Cat & Jack and is now achieving strong year-on-year sales growth and in our strong swim business. Like a performance in board games, we came to the year with the number one market share in swim and have extended that lead to become the clear destination for swim in the U.S.","In home, digital was an important growth driver and we saw particularly strong performance from our threshold brand. We are also very pleased with the performance of our seasonal businesses from greeting cards to outdoor furniture. Within the seasonal event moments, our 4th of July holiday was strong as we quickly leverage guest and business insights from Memorial Day. In essentials, comp sales were up almost 1% benefiting from the launch of our Target Run and Done campaign that began in the first quarter. We are pleased with the response from our guests specifically with awareness and return on ad spend for this campaign, where results are higher than average. The top two messages guests recall from the campaign are that Target is convenient and I can fulfill all of my need to Target, which were our cool campaign goals. Essentials are also seeing the early benefit from our work to improve our value perception. Specifically, when we are price right daily on key audit and essentials, we are seeing increased traffic and unit sales trends.","As Brian mentioned earlier, comp sales in the food and beverage category have stabilized and were flat in the second quarter. We are seeing improvement based on our work to improve freshness and reliability as well as the work on value perception. In produce, we saw high single-digit comp increases in the second quarter driven by even stronger growth in organics. And in adult beverage, we saw ongoing double-digit comp growth driven by assortment and display enhancements we have been rolling out across the country. Importantly, we continue to build food and beverage expertise on our team. Following the hiring of Jeff Burt to lead food and beverage in merchandising at the end of the first quarter, we announced that we have hired two new members of his team earlier this week. Looking ahead, Japanese total team, are focused on building on recent momentum. We know we need to enhance our assortment of convenient options for our guests through this ready to eat, ready to heat or ready to cook and save families time and money. In addition, we are focused on enhancing our exclusive brand assortment in food and beverage, while ensuring we are priced-right daily on key opening price point items.","While overall we have much more to accomplish in the third quarter, our work to improve value perception across all of our assortment is already beginning to have an impact. Specifically, surveys are showing that consumers are noticing Target\u2019s investment in price and value and we saw a much stronger mix of regular price selling in the second quarter as we sort to simplify our promotions, clarify our voice and bring great price right daily items into focus. And it\u2019s working. In fact, our second quarter balance of regular and promotional sales was consistent with levels we haven\u2019t seen since 2012, well before our credit card data breach that changed our promotional cadence and stance.","Also encouraging was the fact that our unit share in key categories grew more quickly in dollar share, which is a key leading indicator of the impact of this work. At a high level, our second quarter average ticket also reflects the impact of this work. At first glance, reporting a slight decline in average ticket might not sound like good news, but when it\u2019s more than offset by an increase in traffic, the picture is more positive. As we dig into the drivers, the change in basket reflected two key factors. The first was a reduction in general incentive offers, which were replaced with better daily value pricing and more category focused discounts. The second was a meaningful increase in the number of quick trips and fill-in trips we saw from our guests.","As we mentioned last year, we saw an opportunity to more appropriately balance between stock-up trips and these quicker, smaller trips. So, we are pleased to see our strategy taking hold and generating both trips and conversion. This work on value perception is about ensuring we are price-right daily on key items while delivering more thoughtful and effective promotions throughout our assortments. In many categories, this means we are reducing our everyday pricing and communicating with much more clarity building confidence among our guests. We will expand the scope of this work in the third quarter and we will continue to measure and iterate based on the response.","Another aspect of our business where we are pleased with our progress is in our inventory position. We reduced out total inventory to last year by more than 4%, while improving the quality of our inventory by bringing unproductive inventory levels down to historical lows. The savings in markdowns through better sell through rates and lower inventory levels has created the capacity for us to invest in what\u2019s new and what\u2019s working which will position us well in the back half of the year. And we do have a lot of newness planned for the rest of the year, perhaps most notable of the new brands that either just launched or will rollout in the next few months.","In addition to Cloud Island which launched in May and it\u2019s already comping double digits, we launched Isabel Maternity in July. This new brand features the 120 key pieces designed to make every stage of maternity easy, comfortable, stylish and affordable with a focus on fit, function and fashion. And this new brand is already posting strong growth. And as we move into September, we are rolling out two new exclusive apparel brands. In women\u2019s we are launching A New Day, an apparel and accessories brand featuring a strong feminine aesthetic through modern prints and patterns with a focus on building confidence through stylish seasonal and basic items and stories that provide the ultimate wardrobe versatility.","And in men\u2019s we are launching Goodfellow & Company, which brings the new modern interpretation of classic books, focus on the strong foundation of core items based on insights our guests tell us they want, great quality, fit and fabric, but there is more in-store. In September we will also launch Project 62, a new home brand based on modern design that is thoughtful and approachable. We also built this brand from guest insights to capture their growing demand for modern design with a focus on solving the challenges of urban living including the need for easy mobility based on potential frequent moves. Items incorporate efficiency, simplicity and great design that make urban environments both highly beautiful and functional. Shortly after in October, we are excited to launch Joy Lab, a new women\u2019s athletic fashion apparel brand. Items were designed based on emerging street style that inspires fitness through fashion and building a community based on style and wellness taking you from crunches to brunches. Given the investment in developing this portfolio of new brands, we plan to support these launches with meaningful 360 degree investments in the way only Target can in marketing and digital on social media, in-store experiences with fixturing, mannequins and signage and in training for our store and digital teams.","It will be hard to miss the amount of newness you will see during the third quarter and we expect our guests will be excited to discover that there is indeed more in the store. Our product design and development, manufacturing, merchandising and marketing teams have been incredibly agile. Having begun their work on these new brands less than 10 months ago, it\u2019s amazing what they been able to accomplish together in this time by keeping truly aligned to our strategic choices. It adds up to a vast body of work and we can\u2019t wait to see all of these new items in our stores and online.","Our success last year in Pillowfort and Cat & Jack provided the proof of concept and gave us the confidence to begin work on these new brands. Both of those new kids brands were double digit comps in the year following their launch and they are both still growing in the second year while building trips category growth and store basket. And as Brian shared Cat & Jack is now a $2 billion brand based on sales volume in the last 12 months through July of this year, exceeding our initial expectations. Of course we haven\u2019t forgotten the back-to-school and back-to-college key seasons which play a huge role in our third quarter results.","In back-to-school comps and market share have grown for 10 years straight. And we are focused on extending that record. We continue to invest in digital to support back-to-school including our school list assist site to provide guests a convenient way to access their child supply list and easily order any or all those items to be delivered to their home. More than a million lists are already available on the site, well ahead of last year and sell through the list site have been running 4x higher than a year ago. When students go back to college mom plays a huge role in making everything happen. So we have made sure this year\u2019s marketing speaks to moms as well as students. Hence those campuses that aren\u2019t lucky enough to have one of the use small format stores with pondering with Barnes & Noble College which operates nearly 800 college schools around the country to offer the Target assortment more than 5 million students.","And finally, given up our success, our team is really excited about the upcoming release in the Star Wars series. To get things started, we are launching our latest Star Wars assortments on September 1, which is being dubbed Force Friday. And to celebrate, we will be opening at midnight in 500 stores across the country. So okay, that\u2019s a lot of newness. I hope you see why we are so excited at Target about all of our strategies and plans coming to life. All of that work supports our long-term vision which is to build on the strengths that have made us such unique retailer for decades.","As Brian shared, we have build a brand from ends, a brand that offers the best of both mass and specialty. And we have the unique multi-category offering that allows us to drive traffic by leaning into core items and trends. And our brand is known for featuring new exclusive and truly differentiated items comprised own brands like Cat & Jack and national brands like Apple and Casper, because we are so unique, how to put in a box and we like that. We are at our best when we connect with our DNA, unleash the potential of our brand promise to expect more and to pay less, leverage our team and let Target be [indiscernible].","With that I will turn it over to Kathy who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks Mark. In the second quarter our traffic sales and financial performance were all better than expected. Notably, the upside to our expectations was broad based across the country, across channels and in all three months of the quarter. Second quarter comparable sales increased 1.3% driven by a traffic increase of 2.1%. We are particularly pleased to see this growth in traffic which reflects strong execution by our team and the early benefit of the work we are doing to transform our business. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.23 was flat to last year. GAAP EPS was $0.01 lower than adjusted EPS reflecting some small unfavorable tax items not related to our current operations.","Both the GAAP and adjusted EPS lines reflect about $0.07 of favorability resulting from the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations. This favorability was included in the adjusted EPS calculation, because it reflects a structural benefit to our tax rate resulting from our operations. The amount recorded in the second quarter reflects the year-to-date benefit of our global operations on our tax rate and we expect to recognize an ongoing benefit in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 in both the third and fourth quarters as well. Our second quarter gross margin rate was down about 40 basis points to last year, driven by increased fulfillment costs and the impact of our efforts to improve pricing and promotions. Merchandise mix had a slightly positive impact on our gross margin rate in the quarter reflecting healthy performance in our signature businesses balanced by broad based strength in hardlines.","One note, beginning this quarter in our financial reporting we have reclassified depreciation expenses associated with our supply chain moving them into the cost of goods line on our P&L. This elective reclassification which resulted from an internal review of how we classify depreciation expense and discussions with the SEC during one of their routine reviews of our filings is reflected in our second quarter 2017 reporting. And we have reclassified prior year results as well. Obviously, this reclassification has no impact on our sales, EBIT, net earnings or EPS but result in equal and offsetting reductions to both our gross margin rate and depreciation and amortization expense rate.","To provide greater clarity, this morning we posted a document on our Investor Relations website that shows the impact of this reclassification on our quarterly gross margins and D&A rate over the last 3 years. That document shows that the reclassification impact has been either 30 basis points or 40 basis points reduction in our quarterly gross margin and D&A rate throughout that entire 3 year period. And one final note, with this reclassification we will no longer include EBITDA metrics in our segment table.","On the SG&A expense line we saw a year-over-year increase of about 50 basis points in the second quarter. This increase was driven by compensation costs reflecting the store labor investments that John highlighted earlier as well as higher bonus expense along with impairments related to anticipated store closures and our work to transform our supply chain. These costs were partially offset by the benefit of continued cost discipline throughout the organization. As I mentioned in one of our calls in 2016 for the last couple of years we have been working to create a culture of thoughtful cost discipline. And I am really pleased to see the ongoing benefit of that effort. I want to pause and thank the team both for their passion to transform our company and for their thoughtful cost management, which is helping to fund our investments in this transformation. At the end of the second quarter, our inventory was more than 4% lower than last year. This is vivid confirmation of the benefit of the work of both the operations and merchandising teams to reduce unproductive inventory and speed up our supply chain. These efforts are driving continued strong in stocks and sales growth on a smaller base of inventory.","Compounding that benefit, we are also beginning to see the impact of our work with vendors to ensure that Target\u2019s payment terms are in line with industry norms, which drove an increase in our payables in the second quarter. The combined benefit of these two factors was an increase in our inventory leverage of more than 10 percentage points compared to last year. The working capital benefit of this leverage improvement is substantial and will provide additional cash to support our transformation. In fact, we are now forecasting 2017 cash flow from operations will be higher than last year despite the operating income reduction we have planed for the year.","So now, as always I want to pause and reiterate our capital deployment priorities which have remained consistent for decades. We first invest capital into our business on projects that support our strategic and financial objectives. Second, we support our dividend and look to extend our record of raising the dividend annually since 1971. And finally, we repurchased our shares within the limits of our current single A credit ratings. In the second quarter, we devoted more than $700 million to capital investment, paid dividends in excess of $300 million and repurchased just under $300 million of our shares. For the year, we continued to expect that our CapEx will be in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range. However, with the increase in 2018 remodels Brian mentioned earlier, we now expect next year\u2019s CapEx will be $3 billion or more somewhat higher than our previous expectations. This highlights our continued discipline regarding investment deployment. We will increase investment where we have seen solid returns to accelerate our transformation and long-term growth.","Our second quarter ROIC performance also highlights the benefit of disciplined capital management. Specifically in the 12 months through the second quarter, we generated a very healthy after-tax ROIC of 13.8%. This is about 10 basis points stronger than we reported in the second quarter a year ago if you exclude the gain from the sale of our pharmacy business. So even on lower operating income we have seen an improvement in ROIC, because we taken working capital out of our business.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our expectations for the third quarter and full year. As we look ahead, we will continue to move with urgency, but plan prudently. Of course, we are facing a tougher prior year comparison in the third quarter and we continue to expand the scope of our pricing and promotional work, which may create additional headwinds for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter comps will be within the range we established across the first two quarters of the year. For the full year, we expect that our comp will be in a range around plan plus or minus 1%. In the third quarter, we are planning for a declining event of approximately $230 million. More than half of this decline will be driven by D&A as we recognized accelerated depreciation related to the anticipated remodels we are planning for 2018. The remaining EBIT pressure will reflect this year\u2019s operating margin investments to support our transformation. Altogether, we are expecting GAAP and adjusted EPS in the $0.75 to $0.95 range in the third quarter.","Based on our better-than-expected performance in the first half of the year, we are now raising our full year GAAP EPS expectation to the range of $4.35 to $4.55 representing an increase of about 11% from our prior guidance range. Adjusted EPS is expected to be about $0.01 lower than GAAP EPS. Reflecting the tax matters excluded from adjusted EPS in the first half of the year.","Before I turn the call back over to Brian, I wanted to step back and look at the underlying strength of our business and how it is enabling our transformation through the first half of the year on sales of just over $32 billion, Target\u2019s operations have generated EBIT of more than $2 billion and nearly $3 billion of cash. We have deployed that cash to fund capital investment of more than $1.2 billion. We returned nearly $1.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we have retired about $600 million of our long-term debt. As I said in our financial community meeting at the beginning of the year, we are so fortunate to have such a strong business and balance sheet, which allow us to invest while many of our peers are pulling back. Not only do we have a plan to create a company that will thrive in this new era in retail, we have the financial strength to get us there.","So with that I will turn the call back over to Brian for some final remarks.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Cathy. Before we move to questions I want to thank you for your engagement and reiterate our commitment to moving quickly, thoughtfully investing in our long-term growth and strong execution every day. While we expect that the near-term environment will remain choppy, we are confident in our 3-year plan to build an even better Target. And our second quarter progress reinforces that confidence. That concludes our prepared remarks.","Now John, Mark, Cathy and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Brian Cornell","Operator, before we start taking questions I just want to make a couple of points. I recognized that our prepared comments today were rather lengthy, but we thought it would be important to give you a sense for the rest of the work taking place at Target today, an update on our progress and I hope we provided clarity around the key areas of focus over the balance of year and as we go into 2018. So with that we would love to open it up for your questions today.","Operator","Our first question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Fassler","Thanks so much and the detail of your comments is very much appreciated. I have two brief questions for I think for Cathy, the first relates to the implied fourth quarter guidance which seems quite subdued relative to a tough fourth quarter a year ago despite the fact that I believe you have an extra week in the quarter and correct me on that if I am wrong. And then the follow-up to that is just you mentioned D&A moving higher, so if you could just give us some color on the magnitude of the move you would expect to off the restated D&A numbers? Thank you so much.","Cathy Smith","Good morning Matt. With regards to both third quarter, fourth quarter and full year we made our guidance as we said we will continue to move with urgency but plan prudently. And I think that\u2019s what you should expect from us. We are finding \u2013 every time we see results coming from our investments we are choosing to continue to invest to accelerate our transformation. And so that\u2019s how I would think about the backside of full year. With regards to the reclassification we did on the supply chain depreciation expense, we posted a great schedule. John and the team posted today to the IR website gives you three full years by quarter. You can see but bottom line is 30 basis points to 40 basis points a quarter change. And you would see that shift from D&A to gross margins.","Matt Fassler","We have that, but just in terms of the \u2013 I think you said you expected D&A to be increasing at a faster rate as you accelerated depreciation associated with upcoming remodels, can you try to contextualize the expected increase, how much the pace of G&A growth will change?","Cathy Smith","Yes. So it is what\u2019s related \u2013 it\u2019s related to our increasing store remodels as we accelerate some of the depreciation there. And for the full year, I was just quickly looking here where you will see a little bit of continued pressure coming through. So it will pick up. We will follow-up with some specifics if you need it.","Matt Fassler","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning, you had a very strong electronics quarter that the switch which has been a huge hit double digit comps in that and in Apple iPad sounding like they are bouncing back, so it seems like there was a material contributor to same-store sales, how do you think about the sustainability of this benefit presumably the switch moderates but if you think the Apple benefits on tablet compares and the new phone and what are the categories do you think could come in and pick up for what the switch is provided?","Brian Cornell","Mark why don\u2019t you provide some insights into our view on electronics?","Mark Tritton","Yes. Thanks Chris. I think firstly just on the Apple comments, they weren\u2019t just driven by tablet, they are driven across the board in categories. And we had really strong showing in Q2 on the iWatch which we worked with Apple on clearly. And we have a lot in our plans for Q3 and Q4 with potential new launches as I have outlined. So we think there is still room for growth and continuing the trend. In terms of Nintendo Switch, we worked really closely with those guys as well to develop not only a product but a marketing campaign that the guests really responded to. And so we have been able to secure inventory and a plan all through the fourth quarter, so feeling positive about sustaining a trend there.","Brian Cornell","And Chris I think it\u2019s consistent with our focus on bringing newness to the guest. Not only in electronics but through our assortment, I think Mark and his team have done a terrific job working with our vendors and also building own brands that bring excitement and newness to our guests each and every day.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then on the working capital, CapEx side you are seeing some very nice benefits here on working capital this year, how do you think about this year inventory outlook at the end of the year and the working capital benefit and you raised CapEx a bit next year, do you think that increased CapEx is largely offset by continued ongoing benefits in the working capital area?","Cathy Smith","So Chris as we have said, we know that we have got a multi-year journey around the supply chain transmission which will help that working capital continue to come through the business. And we wanted to make sure we will keep making that progress through time, so not going to commit longer term just yet as we \u2013 it\u2019s really going to be associated with the a lot of the supply chain transformation. On the increase in CapEx next year again, we are not giving all of next year guidance, but thought important to signal where we are going with our CapEx.","Chris Horvers","Understood, have great back half.","Brian Cornell","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Schick with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","David Schick","Hi good morning and thanks for all the details. Really wanted to simplify into one question all these different tests and get at one issue whether it\u2019s the world, the tests of curbside and same day whether it\u2019s the rollout of in-store, all the work you are doing, could you talk about all the new initiatives and is it \u2013 does it have more traction with existing customers, anything you can share existing customers capturing back more of their wallet or is it new customers that are new to Target as you go through these new initiatives?","Brian Cornell","David, I would tell you it\u2019s the combination of both. And overall, we are very focused on improving the guest experience whether they are shopping in-store or online, making sure that we deepen the relationship with existing and new guests. And we are very pleased with the traffic increases we saw during the quarter. We are honestly very excited about the work that Mark and his team are doing around bringing new brands to our guests. And we have recognized that to move forward and to continue to execute, we have got to continue to make sure we are providing fulfillment options that our guests are looking for today. So as John talked about during our prepared comments, we are very focused right now on testing and expanding different fulfillment options. We have seen some very positive responses to think like Target Restock and we are going to continue to ensure that we can meet the needs of our guests no matter how they want to shop at Target.","David Schick","Thanks. Just as a sort of an add-on to that, one other things over the last decade that some retailers run into with all these attempts to reengage of a lot of which are very exciting is either overdoing it or over complicating it, how are you guarding against at the store level the associates not being overwhelmed by these initiatives and managing through that?","Brian Cornell","It is a very important question and I am going to turn it over to John here to build on that. But we are trying to make sure we are very, very focused right now. And we have the guests in mind first that the initiatives that we are bringing forward are guest centered, but importantly that we have the right focus on execution each and every day. And I think what we saw in the second quarter is a byproduct of our focus on execution each and every day in our stores, online, in our supply chain and I think you are starting to see that focus really connect with the guests.","John Mulligan","Dave, I think the other thing I would add, you are 100% right about the focus. I think the key challenge there for us is to continue to take work that is not guests facing out of the store and guest facing work there like we study investments we are making in food and beverage and beauty, in visual merchandising, that includes things like order pickup and shipping from the store. But there are opportunities everywhere else to pull work out of the store and I think the stores teams have done a great job optimizing within the box. We need to continue to optimize upstream to help them take work out and that\u2019s a lot of testing we are doing today. I didn\u2019t talk a lot about it, but we have tests going on in multiple parts of the country, focused on taking work out of the store, so they can be focused on the guests.","David Schick","Thanks so much.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Robby Ohmes","Good morning. Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian the \u2013 you guys have been mentioning the environment challenges and we are seeing very aggressive promotions out there in categories like apparel, your store traffic improved a lot this quarter, I am just curious are there \u2013 can you give us any color \u2013 are you picking up more share from competitor store closings than you would have thought? And then also as you shift more to EDLP while others are getting maybe more promotional, any insights from what you have seen so far in August that you can share with us on how all this is working out? And sorry just to add on this also and I don\u2019t know whether John Mulligan or Mark want to jump in on this, but as you pulled back up almost more you shift more to EDLP, can you remind us where things like cartwheel fit into that as you move forward and also how you see Red Card penetration playing out in your strategy? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","So, Robby, there is 4 or 5 different questions there and we will try to un-bundle each of them. But as Mark talked about during his prepared comments during the second quarter, we saw very strong market share growth across a number of categories. We continue to see share growth in apparel, in home, in hardline and one of the things that I think we felt best about in the quarter and it\u2019s a byproduct of the work we have done from a promo standpoint as we continue to see our business in essentials shift back to regular price sales and the impact of our new marketing and advertising campaign, the Target Run and Done campaign, which has driven really positive reaction from the guests and accelerated our business in essentials. So, that was a real big highlight for us in the second quarter. And we have talked about this before. We are at our best when we balanced both style and household essentials and you are seeing that balance come to play in the second quarter and we certainly are going to continue that over the balance of the year and into 2018. So, it was a period of time where we felt good about the progress we are making as we pickup market share in many of our signature and style categories. We have seen growth in our essential businesses and we will build off of that as we go into the balance of 2017 and \u201818.","Cathy Smith","Sorry, Robby, around Cartwheel. So, Cartwheel remains a really viable promotional vehicle and gets engaging the tool for us. And what we are doing though in the simplification of our pricing messaging and creating great price right daily items is we are using Cartwheel, but we are reducing the amount of stock that\u2019s coming in and that\u2019s really helping us to clarify and simplify our message to the guests about what true everyday value is as well as what\u2019s an exceptional promotion. So, the re-scoping of that has been tremendous thus far and we are really \u2013 our regular business is shining and our promotional business risk out in a great way.","Robby Ohmes","And any chance we can get you guys to comment on August?","Brian Cornell","Obviously, not.","Robby Ohmes","Great job, Brian. Thanks so much.","Brian Cornell","Thank you. Appreciate it, Robby.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Summers with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Bob Summers","Hey, good morning, guys.","Brian Cornell","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Summers","Just two questions, you have had some recent hires in sort of the food umbrella, I am just curious as to how the new individual fit into the current strategy and whether this is a catalyst for shift and maybe something more into the prepared food sort of side of the equation? And then secondly, if you are willing to comment, I would love to know what the trends look like, the business trends look like in and around Prime Day?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Why don\u2019t we turn it over to Mark to talk about both food and what we saw during that Prime period?","Mark Tritton","Thanks Bob. I think that we outlined in our Q1 comments around the emergence of our strategy that we are going to be on the journey of implementation as Jeff joined us in the business. And Jeff has already come in and begun start testing and iterating new ideas and concepts on top of our strategies that are creating growth vehicles. So, we are excited about that, the new people entering our business and just creating new strength against the strategic intent. So, firstly, Liz Nordlie will add value to own brand growth potential there and strengthen our efforts there as well as Mark Kenny, really with his expertise in general grocery but specifically in the convenient meal area and in bakery etcetera. I mean, that is part of our ongoing strategic intent to strengthen and focus there. So, these are key investments in our strategy and in our team balancing them against existing talent. In regards to your query around Prime, we were really happy to see ongoing trends maintain during Prime and we had positive comps and a really strong growth in regular price business continuing through those days but on in-store and online.","Bob Summers","Okay, great. Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Bob, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Peter Benedict","Alright, guys. Thanks. And Mark, I just was hoping you could expand maybe a little bit on some of the merchandising assortment changes that you are making in the consumable side of the business to food area, particularly in pet food, what\u2019s going on there and anything to note there from a remodel prospective?","Mark Tritton","Yes, thanks Peter. So, let me just start with pet. I mean, we announced this month the addition of Blue Buffalo to our assortment, which is the number one brand in the U.S. and a really core assortment to get. So excited to add that into our mix and we already have a lot of data from our guests is just that they wanted to see that at Target. We also embarked on an agreement with BarkBox. So, really refocusing our accessory and our total assortment of doing business inside pet, so an exciting uptick there, because that brings further guests trips and conversion. Around the food and beverage area in terms of general assortment, we are still working on there and more to follow.","Peter Benedict","That\u2019s helpful. And then just leveraging on that, when you think about the private brand introductions, I mean, good color on what\u2019s coming this year, but when we think about next year, is it continue to be in kind of the signature categories or should we expect some private brand introductions to start to emerge on the consumable side of the store? Thank you.","Mark Tritton","I think that we have talked openly about a roster of more than 12 brands that we will be bringing to life over a period of time. We have begun that journey. That continues into 2018. It highlights definitely the signature areas, but the strength at providing differentiation exclusivity and therefore preference for Target through these is applicable to many different areas. So, we are looking at all areas and opportunities and we have some plans in place.","Peter Benedict","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Brandon Fletcher","Hey, guys. Fantastic quarter. Congratulations. The only question I have essentially just on the pick for store concept, I just want to share a comment we had from an industrial engineer that was working for mew a long time ago that it\u2019s about as efficient as a driver who takes three rides to take a left. There is massive cost when you have people walk the store instead of being your customers and walk it back out on a simulated basis. I get incrementally. I get that you don\u2019t have to have the checkout cost and that offsets a little bit. Is there something that\u2019s coming that you guys are confident on the operational side that will make you pick from store the way you guys are doing it better than lots of other folks, so that we don\u2019t face as much of efficiency? And similarly, will the remodels make those operational changes you think less difficult or more efficient in terms of cost structure?","Brian Cornell","Yes, hi Brandon. I think anytime you focus on just one slice of the total fulfillment, you lose picture for the whole thing right, we are trying to optimize the total economics for Target and those economics include investments, capital investments we might otherwise have to make if we don\u2019t utilize the existing assets. So, I think we can point to any one slice and say this was going to be better or worse, but again we are optimizing total economic picture and I\u2019d have you think about that. I think the remodels where they will really help us and it\u2019s in conjunction with us taking inventory out of the backroom is our ability to optimize that backroom more efficiently to drive more productivity as we shift from the store. And so that\u2019s the real opportunity as we go through the remodel cycle.","Brandon Fletcher","That\u2019s the micro fulfillment in the backrooms would be one of the benefit to remodels?","Brian Cornell","For sure. And in conjunction with operating changes to reduce inventory like I was talking about earlier and taking work out of that \u2013 other work out of the store.","Brandon Fletcher","It sounds great. Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you quantify how much of the $1 billion of operating profit investment you plan to make has already been deployed thus far this year?","Cathy Smith","Good morning, Michael. As you saw in the quarter, we are seeing the continued investment in both the SG&A as well as gross margin. We also though are working really hard to make sure that we can offset with efficiencies throughout the organization where appropriate. And so you are seeing that you saw it come through in SG&A and in gross margin this second quarter, you saw it in the first quarter as well. We continue to do that. So, where we see the investments give the return that we expect and the results we expect we are investing faster and heavier to accelerate the transformation. So, I would say we are on path to what we said we would do and you are seeing it come through in both Q1 and Q2.","Brian Cornell","Operator, we have got time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question is from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just ask about promotions a little bit more if you don\u2019t mind. I know management promotions are fluid, but how much more work do you need to do in moving your categories in products to EDLP and what \u2013 where are these changes impacting the second half outlook and I know you have mentioned that there has been challenges in the past in terms of conveying value to your guests and I just wondered how this messaging has changed?","Mark Tritton","Yes. Hi Kate, I will take that one. So our promotional efforts are really rolled through the quarter even. And we began them in first quarter in April and a second round of taking key items that comprise our guest basket and focusing on priced right daily items really took hold and then second wave in \u2013 by the end of July. The next round of that is through October and that\u2019s when we will be coming together to have a more concise in-store marketing campaign and regular cadence of new ways [ph] to the guest to communicate value. So we think at that point that we have a strong base to maintain and this is why in half two we have been prudent in how we forecasted our sales and margin based on also unit growth initially. We see trip growth initially and we need to see that dollar growth balanced out over time. But we know that we have been patient with that, hence some of that earlier discussions at the start of the year about investing ahead of.","Brian Cornell","I think promotions along with many of the other things we talked about are still obviously in the early stages. We are excited about the results that we have seen with remodels, but we have hundreds of stores in front of us. We have seen great response to some of our small format but again we will open up dozens of additional stores over the next couple of years. The brands that we have launched have been well received, but we are really just getting into in the heart of the brand launches as we go in the back half of \u201817 and \u201818 as well as the pricing and promo work. So we are very pleased with the progress. We know we have got much more work in front us, but we thought today would be a great chance to give you a progress report and give you a sense for the amount of work and the scope of work that\u2019s taking place within Target. So that concludes our second quarter 2017 earnings call. I really appreciate all of you participating. So thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your attendance. You may disconnect your lines."],"20329":["Target (NYSE:TGT) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February 23, 2012 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregg W.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, February 23, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2011 Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Mulligan, Senior Vice President, Treasury and Accounting, who as we announced last month, will succeed Doug as EVP and CFO beginning April 1.","This morning, I'll provide a high-level summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, along with our strategic priorities in 2012, and Kathy will discuss category results, guest insights and upcoming initiatives. Doug will provide detail on our fourth quarter financial performance and progress toward our long-term financial goals. And finally, John Mulligan will provide our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012. Following John's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening today to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert, Doug and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.","Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","We are pleased with Target's full year financial results, which reflect the ability of our teams to manage our businesses in an up and down environment. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share, which we report as a measure of the performance of our U.S. businesses, were $1.49 per share this year, up 8.3% from 2010. For the year in total, our adjusted earnings per share were $4.41, up 14.3% from a year ago.","For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales increased 2.2%, more than a percentage point below our expectation as we entered the quarter. This shortfall was concentrated in the peak of the holiday season as promotional activity throughout Retail was exceptionally intense, and we chose to maintain an appropriate balance between driving sales and profitability. Post-holiday, the pace of our sales returned to the much stronger pre-holiday pace, and we've seen sales momentum build, particularly in discretionary categories. Against that backdrop, our teams did an outstanding job maintaining the business, controlling fourth quarter inventory and maintaining our operating margin rates at healthy levels.","For the full year, we grew our comparable store sales by 3%, our best annual performance since 2007. This growth reflects investments made in our remodel program and 5% Rewards loyalty program, both of which continue to drive incremental traffic and sales. These strategies make Target a more desirable shopping destination and enhance guest loyalty, both of which are critical for our long-term success.","As you all know, last year's macroeconomic environment was less than robust due to slow GDP growth, persistent high unemployment, housing weakness and stagnant incomes, particularly for lower and middle class consumers. Both our PFresh remodels and 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program were particularly valuable in this environment, allowing us to maintain positive traffic and growing our comparable store sales in line with our long-term financial goals.","For the year, our teams did a great job of managing the profitability of our Retail sales, largely offsetting the gross margin pressure from our sales driving initiatives through expense leverage. This discipline kept our operating margins in line with our goal and past performance, while maintaining strong service levels in our stores.","And for both the quarter and the year, the Credit Card team did an outstanding job managing our receivables portfolio, generating outstanding profitability on a planned decline in the asset base. Of course, beyond the profits directly measured in our Credit Card segment, our credit and debit cards serve as the platform for our 5% Rewards and REDcard Free Shipping loyalty programs.","In our Canadian segment, we reached the halfway point between the commitment to expand into Canada and our expected store openings in spring 2013, and I'm very pleased with our progress. We have a strong executive team in place at our new headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario, and we continue to hire talented team members who will help bring the Target brand to life for our Canadian guests.","In addition, we're building 3 distribution centers across Canada, and we recently hosted our first all-day joint planning session with the Canadian vendor community to familiarize them with the Target brand and our expectations and begin developing the foundation for our joint business planning process.","While it has certainly been a volatile year for both the economy and our businesses, our teams have stayed rock solid, with consistent execution and a passionate commitment to our brand and our guests. Our team is the foundation of our ability to generate strong financial performance and a world-class brand.","Looking ahead, we believe the pace of economic recovery will continue to be slow and uncertain. We've been encouraged by recent improvements in some key economic measures, and we're pleased with the pace of our sales since the holiday season. Yet we expect we'll continue to see mixed signals in the economy going forward. We're continuing to plan our business appropriately, maintaining flexibility to chase business if we see more robust improvement in jobs, housing and household income. Yet, even our base case assumption of a continued slow and uneven recovery would allow us to stay on track to achieve our long-term financial goals of $100 billion or more in sales and $8 or more in earnings per share by 2017.","As we look ahead to 2012, we expect to open 20 to 25 stores, adding 15 to 20 locations, net of relocations and closures. Including in this new store plan are 5 CityTarget stores which will begin opening in July. While these slightly smaller urban stores will incorporate the Target brand and store experience, we'll tailor our assortment to meet the needs of the trade area and adapt our operating routines to work in smaller spaces with higher traffic.","Our initial group of pilot locations will allow us to further optimize assortments and refine processes, enabling these stores to operate at peak efficiency. We plan to take time to learn from these stores before we determine the appropriate pace of investment and number of additional CityTarget stores we'll open over the next few years. In addition, we'll apply what we learn in these pilot stores across the chain in our larger U.S. stores and in Canada.","In 2012, we'll continue to remodel existing general merchandise locations, adding perishable food along with a deeper assortment of dry, dairy and frozen items and enhanced store layout and presentation in areas including apparel, home, beauty, shoes and baby. Our teams performed a record number of these remodel projects in 2011, completing nearly 400 and bringing us to a total of nearly 900 general merchandise stores. This year, we expect to complete approximately 230 more general merchandise remodels in the U.S., bringing us to more than 1,100 stores by the end of the year.","Additionally, we'll continue to selectively remodel a number of Super Target locations and expect to complete approximately 10 of those projects this year.","In 2012, we'll also continue to enhance guest loyalty with programs like 5% Rewards and REDcard Free Shipping. Penetration of sales on our debit and credit cards continue to run well ahead of the year ago and has now reached a level beyond any point in our history. Penetration in the Kansas City market, which launched 5% Rewards a year ahead of the rest of the country, is still growing and well ahead of the rest of the chain, giving us a high degree of confidence that this program will continue to be a meaningful growth driver in 2012 and beyond.","Beyond these large initiatives, Kathy and her team are focused on driving excitement for our assortments, turning well-designed merchandise from partners like Jason Wu and Missoni, with a guest experience that's unique in Retail. We know that we need to continue to stay fresh and innovative, becoming even stronger as a destination for great style and design. Kathy will provide more specifics in a few minutes.","And of course, we continue to devote meaningful resources to our multichannel efforts. Our teams continue to work diligently, implementing hundreds of fixes to target.com to address issues that have emerged since the launch of our new platform last fall. As a result of these efforts, performance metrics for the site have already meaningfully improved.","We're planning multiple additional releases this spring to continue enhancing the website, and I can assure you that there is no higher priority for this management team than to bring a great experience to our guests of target.com, just as we put the highest priority on the guest experience in our stores.","Finally, selling our Credit Card receivables portfolio to the right partner at the right time on appropriate terms continues to be one of our top priorities. Our announcement in January that we're taking a pause in our efforts did not reflect a change in our desired outcome, but only in our thinking around the timing of a potential transaction.","John Mulligan, Terry Scully and our finance and Credit Card teams expect to once again engage with potential partners later this year, with the goal of concluding an agreement with a partner by a year from now. In addition, Doug will be available as a resource in these discussions until his part-time engagement with us ends in early November.","Before I turn the call over to Kathy, I want to thank Doug Scovanner for his tireless work on behalf of Target and our shareholders. Doug and I have worked closely for 18 years now, and he has been a trusted colleague throughout that time. Doug has always maintained that it's his desire to retire young, and despite my efforts to try and talk him out of it, he has stayed true to that goal. Both Doug and his contributions will be missed, but he has developed a talented finance team and an outstanding successor in John Mulligan, and I am highly confident John will uphold this company's tradition of having a superior CFO who is a strategic thinker and trusted partner to the CEO and broader leadership team.  Additionally, Target's commitment to financial discipline and shareholder value creation remains as steadfast as ever.","Now Kathy will provide more detail on fourth quarter results, share recent guest insights and outline initiatives for 2012 and beyond. Kathy?","Kathryn A. Tesija","Thanks, Gregg. As you know, competitive intensity reached an all-time high during the holiday season. Research indicates that across retail, 2 out of 3 holiday season purchases in gift-giving categories were on some sort of promotion, and these promotional discounts were significant, ranging from 25% in some categories to more than 50% in others.","Against that backdrop, I'm very pleased that we came into the season with a conservative position, allowing Target to offer compelling value without the need to desperately participate in an unprofitable race to unload excess inventory. We ended the season clean, and we're pleased that our sales trends reverted to a more normal pattern following the holiday.","The margin mix of our fourth quarter sales was solid and in line with the rest of the year. Among need-based categories, Grocery continues to lead the way with double-digit comps as we continue to add square footage in our remodeled stores, and our general merchandise guests increasingly associate Target with food.","Beauty and apparel led our discretionary categories in both the fourth quarter and the year. In apparel, we've seen particular strength in boys and girls and Performance Activewear, both signature businesses for Target. Home was down slightly for the quarter, consistent with third quarter results, with stronger results in Housewares and seasonal categories. Hardlines comps were the most challenging in both the fourth quarter and the full year. These industries are experiencing soft secular trends overall, and fourth quarter promotional intensity was the most severe in these categories.","Our sales throughout 2011 reflected the impact of cost inflation, primarily in apparel, soft, home and food. As expected, we've been able to generally maintain gross margin rates within these categories by managing costs, and when necessary, raising retail prices. Also as expected, guests have maintained their dollar spending by purchasing fewer units in categories that saw retail price increases. Recently, costs have begun to level off, and as we look ahead to 2012, we believe our guests will continue to achieve a balance between units and price, maintaining their dollar spending within their household budgets.","As we look at the impact of our 2 large growth initiatives in 2011, it's clear that we are successfully leading our existing guests to become increasingly loyal and engaged. Even prior to the launch of 5% Rewards, our REDcard guests were among our better and best guests, shopping more often, spending more at Target and shopping a greater number of categories each trip. Since the launch of this new loyalty program, each of these metrics has improved, making REDcard guests even more valuable.","With our store remodels, we create a more relevant assortment which invites our guests to make more of their shopping trips with us, and they've responded, adding trips and sustaining that higher frequency over time. Initially, these extra trips tend to focus more on food and commodity categories, but over time, these trips expand to more of the store.","Programs like these, which deepen the relationship with our guests, continue to sustain our sales performance in an environment where moderate income households are cutting trips and spending. Data from 2011 indicates that we held or gained wallet share across multiple guest segments, but we gained the most wallet share from our already better and best guests, demonstrating the power of these programs.","As we look to 2012, we'll continue to drive growth with existing programs and look for new ways to drive loyalty like our REDcard Free Shipping program, which we launched in the fourth quarter. In 2012, we're expanding our Pharmacy Rewards program beyond REDcard members in an effort to build greater loyalty among our current pharmacy guests. Like 5% Rewards, Pharmacy Rewards is a powerful tool for generating additional trips and sales across our assortments. By expanding this incentive program to non-cardholders, we expect to bring millions more guests to the program, generating incremental traffic and sales.","Beyond loyalty programs, our merchant teams are constantly striving to bring guests the right assortment of trusted national brands, high-quality own brands and a steady stream of surprises with Target exclusives and limited time-only partnerships. Over time, we've engaged in more than 80 unique design partnerships, elevating our brand while creating a sense of urgency and excitement for our guests.","Following up on our Missoni for Target collection last fall, we've been very pleased with the results of our collection with acclaimed designer, Jason Wu. The guest response was incredibly strong as they lined up outside of Target stores across the country the morning of the launch.","We're also giving guests in Canada a chance to shop this amazing collection. As we announced last week, today, Target opened a one-day only Jason Wu for Target pop-up store in Toronto. The event, which includes a private, media and influencer gathering and consumer shopping experience is Target's first brand activation in Canada.","Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Mini for Target collection has proven a big success in both generating buzz and driving sales. We launched this collection of affordable Apparel & Accesories for infants, toddlers and tweens in November and added more content at the end of December. Additional collections will be made available throughout the year.","World-renowned actress, singer and best-selling children's author, Julie Andrews, in collaboration with Target and The Walt Disney Company, is launching the first National Princess Week beginning April 22 in Target stores and online at target.com. We'll feature an array of Disney Princess merchandise, including apparel, toys, books, CDs, movies, personal care items and stationary, many of which are exclusive and will highlight beloved princess characters such as Ariel, Cinderella and Snow White.","In music, we partnered with Grammy award winner Adele to re-release her album 21 with 4 exclusive tracks. Target launched a new spot for the re-release immediately following Adele's performance at the Grammy Awards, and the guest response shows that both the ad and the album have been wildly successful.","To usher in the spring season, we are launching a campaign to show our guests that color changes everything. This campaign supports our discretionary apparel, Home and Beauty categories with a simple upbeat theme. We're supporting this campaign with bold in-store signing, along with print, broadcast and social media marketing. We launched the campaign with a 60-second spot during the Grammy Awards that continues to generate an amazing amount of buzz.","And finally, we're very excited about The Shops At Target, which we announced last month. Beginning May 6, we will create a sense of discovery with surprising designs across a variety of departments. Flight one will include collections from 5 very different, very unique shops from around the country, offering unique products in beauty, apparel, pets, home and candy. The collection will be available for a limited time and we'll launch other flights later in the year. Beyond this new strategy, we'll continue to work with designers and brands to create Target exclusive collections. The Shops At Target is simply our latest innovation in our effort to make great design accessible at amazing prices.","I'm quite pleased with our plans for 2012 and our sales momentum coming out of the holiday season. We're constantly listening to our guests and developing new ways to give them what they want and need. This year, we will continue to focus on providing unbeatable value, while inspiring our guests every time they shop with us, deepening their loyalty to Target.","Now Doug and John will cover fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Doug?","Douglas A. Scovanner","Thanks, Kathy. This morning, I'll provide additional detail on Target's 2011's financial performance, and I'll benchmark that performance against the long-term financial plan we discussed with you in detail last August at our Financial Community Meeting. Then I'll turn it over to John Mulligan who will provide insight into our plans for 2012 and beyond.","Our 2011 performance reinforces our belief that we remain right on track to achieve $100 billion or more in sales in North America and $8 or more in earnings per share by 2017. To summarize, we expect to achieve this sales performance 5 years from now through a combination of achieving 3% average annual growth in our U.S. comparable store sales and by generating $6 billion or more in annual sales in Canada by 2017.","And we expect to translate this sales performance to $8 or more in consolidated EPS by maintaining our current U.S. Retail EBITDA margin rate of about 10% and by deploying excess cash flow to retire 3% to 4% of our shares annually throughout that period.","In 5 years, this recipe would result in about $7.20 in earnings per share on $94 billion-plus in U.S. sales and about $0.80 a share on $6 billion-plus in Canadian sales. This performance would also enable us to grow our dividends to $3 or more per share by the end of that period, representing a compound growth rate of about 20% per year, matching our dividend growth rate actually achieved over the last 5 years.","As you know, we recently began reporting an adjusted EPS metric to allow all of us to measure Target's progress against our goal to grow this measure from $3.86 in 2010 to our objective of $7.20 or more by 2017. In order to remain precisely on track, you can calculate that we would be expected to generate adjusted EPS of about $4.20 in 2011, $4.60 in 2012, $5 in 2013, $5.50 in 2014 and so on. These are simply the calculated figures that define the precise and smooth path from $3.86 in 2010 to the $7.20 U.S. component of our expected 2017 performance. As such, they represent the benchmarks against which our results and our future guidance should be judged.","So let's review our 2011 U.S. performance in this light. We generated annual comparable store sales growth of 3.0%, spot on our long-term objective, driven in part by adding 340 basis points of sales penetration on our branded, credit and debit card products. We achieved a 10.0% EBITDA margin rate in our U.S. Retail segment, again spot on our long-term objective on this critical metric.","We had an outstanding year in our U.S. Credit Card segment, and we retired more than 5% of our shares during the year. Altogether, we earned adjusted EPS of $4.41 in 2011, well above the relevant $4.20 benchmark, with Credit Card allowance reductions driving the favorable variance. Even if we ignore the reality of this 2011 income from allowance reductions resulting [ph] from reduced risk, we still slightly exceeded the relevant adjusted EPS benchmark. In other words, in 2011, we delivered performance in the U.S., fully consistent with the performance levels required over time to meet our objectives, and we retired a greater percentage of our outstanding shares than necessary to keep up the pace.","Importantly, we achieved all of this while laying a very strong investment foundation for a bright future for Target in Canada. Viewed from another prospective, one year ago, we outlined how we plan to grow EPS 10% or more in 2011 from the adjusted EPS of $3.86 achieved in 2010, and our 2011 results well exceeded that growth rate although with several notable variances.","On the one hand, we fell short of achieving our earlier more robust forecast for U.S. sales growth. In our Canadian segment, EPS dilution ended up a little higher than we expected. By the way, this higher dilution was due in part to faster and more substantial share repurchase execution and a lower Canadian tax rate, both of which will create substantial shareholder value over time. In EPS terms, these factors were more than offset by the much stronger-than-expected performance of our U.S. Credit Card segment and by the larger-than-expected EPS benefit, driven by buying back more shares and buying them sooner than expected.","I'll leave you with one final thought regarding our valuation. Many of you directly incorporate our near-term Canadian -- reported Canadian losses into a PE analysis of Target. To be clear, this makes no sense to us. Even if our future Canadian profitability were to fall short of our expectations, it's almost certain that we'll enjoy some amount of income once preopening expenses are behind us late next year. Our view is that a valuation analysis of Target today should begin with an assessment of the value of our U.S. business segments, which we estimate will earn between $4.55 and $4.75 in 2012 and which we believe are likely to grow on average 9% to 10% per year for many years to come, inclusive of the benefit of significant and growing ongoing share repurchase.","On top of that U.S. valuation, one should add the amount you believe Canada is worth. Our view is that Canada is worth several dollars per outstanding Target share as of today and very likely much more over time. Even if you elect to severely discount our view, it's impossible for us to understand why you would elect to subtract anything instead of adding something for the substantial profits and cash flow we'll generate in Canada beginning very soon.","With that, I'd like to introduce John Mulligan, who will provide more detail on our outlook for the first quarter, full year 2012 and beyond. John and I have worked together for many years, and I am confident he will take us to the next level. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Doug. I'm excited to be here with you today to cover our plans for 2012 and beyond, and I'm also looking forward to meeting and getting to know all of you in the coming months. As Doug just highlighted, our 2011 performance keeps us right on track to deliver our long-run financial goals. Today, I'm going to highlight how our plans for 2012 keep us on track to meet those goals, even while we face some unique dynamics created by investments in our Canadian market launch.","In the U.S. Retail segment in 2012, we're planning comparable store sales of 3% or a little more for the full year. This performance is expected in an environment of continued sluggish economic growth, supplemented by the impact of our remodel program, which continues to meet or exceed our traffic and sales goals, combined with growth driven by 5% Rewards.","Based on our experience with this loyalty program in Kansas City, which has exceeded our expectations, we now expect the penetration of sales on our cards across the country will grow another 300 basis points or more in 2012, moving us beyond 12% penetration for the year.","In 2012, we expect these traffic and sales driving strategies will drive a small gross margin rate decline for the full year. And we'll rely on teams throughout the company, but most notably our store teams, to continue this strong record of disciplined expense control, allowing us to offset gross margin rate declines along with expense pressure related to our multichannel investments.","In total, these expectations would sustain our EBITDA margin rate at around 10% in 2012, consistent with our long-range financial plan and our actual results in 2011. This also means that expected leverage in depreciation and amortization would achieve a Retail EBIT rate of 7% or more in 2012, also consistent with our long-range plan.","In our Credit Card segment, we expect outstanding profitability to continue. And as you saw on our fourth quarter results, we're now cycling against a period of meaningful reserve reductions, which will continue through the third quarter of this year. We expect the size of the portfolio to continue to decline, although at a slower rate as our newer, higher-quality accounts have a much lower tendency to revolve, while still driving significant incremental sales for Target. As of today, this means we expect 2012 average receivables will decline another $0.5 billion or more from 2011.","Given these expectations, we expect to generate a spread to LIBOR in the range of 7%, reflective of a very healthy portfolio, corresponding to fewer segment profit dollars in 2012 than we experienced in 2011 for the reasons I've outlined. As we discuss this segment in 2012, spread to LIBOR will become a more important metric because pretax ROIC has become less useful analytically with the retirement of the Chase financing at the end of 2011. As you know, we funded this repayment with low-cost unsecured debt, and therefore, the interest cost associated with this new funding will not be recorded in the Credit Card segment.","In Canada, we'll continue our work to open 125 to 135 stores in former Zellers locations, with the first wave set to open in spring 2013. In total, we believe the expense associated with these activities will drive around $0.50 of EPS dilution in 2012, at the high end of the range we laid out at our Analyst Day last August. As Doug noted earlier, if we end up with a lower-than-expected Canadian tax rate or faster-than-expected share repurchase in 2012, we might end up with slightly more than $0.50 of Canadian dilution. In fact, these 2 factors are the reason our dilution expectations have moved to the high end of the range we outlined last August.","Of course, that's good news, because both of those events are key value creators in the long run. Among the components of 2012 expenses driven by our Canadian investments, fourth quarter 2011 Canadian D&A and interest expenses were close to the run rates you'll see in each of the 4 quarters of 2012. On the Canadian SG&A line, we expect to see quarterly increases throughout 2012. As the team there continues to grow as planned, we'll begin to incur dead rent on Zellers locations around midyear, and we buildout our Canadian distribution and IT solutions.","Now let's turn to our expectations for our capital structure and deployment of cash in 2012. We expect about $3.3 billion of capital expenditures in 2012, reflecting approximately $2.5 billion in U.S. Retail segment, essentially flat to 2011, as we continue to make investments in our substantial ongoing remodel program, new stores, distribution, multichannel and other IT projects.","We expect 2012 capital expenditures of approximately $800 million in Canada, down from just under $2 billion in 2011. We expect to continue our uninterrupted record of quarterly dividend payments, and we believe our board is likely to increase the annual dividend later in the year as well. Beyond these investments, we believe our debt ratings will continue to accommodate meaningful share repurchase, allowing for $1.5 billion or more in 2012. At current share prices, this would allow us to retire more than 4% of our shares in 2012.","If a Credit Card receivable sale were to occur later in the year, we'd be able to dedicate a portion of the proceeds to share repurchase, increasing our 2012 capacity beyond this level.","So let's put this all together. In our U.S. businesses, we expect to generate adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.75 in 2012, putting us right on the growth curve Doug highlighted earlier. Adding our expectations for Canadian dilution would result in 2012 GAAP earnings per share in the range of $4.05 to $4.25. Given our outlook for 2012, we believe we'll stay firmly on track to achieve the benchmark EPS Doug laid out of about $5 or more in 2013 adjusted earnings per share. In Canada, we believe we'll experience less dilution than we did in 2012, and we'll provide a more precise estimate as our plans develop. We continue to expect that the Canadian segment to become accretive in the fourth quarter of 2013, something we first outlined for you last August.","Finally, I'll cover our expectations for the first quarter of 2012. As we look at our business today, we feel very good about where we are headed. Our current comparable store sales forecast for the quarter is roughly 4%. And for what it's worth, our February comps have been running well ahead of that pace. But as we all know, we shouldn't get too excited about single-month trends. We expect to deliver first quarter Retail EBIT margins in line with last year's performance.","In the Credit Card segment, we expect to generate a spread to LIBOR in the 7% range. However, we'll face our toughest comparison during the year as we annualize $125 million in reserve reductions from a year ago. Altogether, our current forecast is for Target to earn $0.97 to $1.07 of adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2012, with GAAP EPS reflecting about $0.09 of dilution from the Canadian expenses.","Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","We're very pleased with our 2011 financial results and our sales trends coming out of the holiday season. Our plans for 2012 support our long-term financial goals, while we invest in new stores both domestically and in Canada, deepen our multichannel capabilities and continue our ambitious remodel program. On top of investments in our core business, we expect to continue returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in 2012 and beyond.","That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now Kathy, Doug, John and I will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess my main question is on the quarter, how sales progressed. You mentioned, Gregg, in your prepared comments how the holiday period was promotional, you guys successfully avoided it. But it was also when your comp was weakest and the traffic was weakest. How much of that do you think was driven by online, particularly for the mid-December period where shoppers seem to just be going more and more online? And how do you expect to address that especially given your .com launches and some of the challenges you had back in September?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Yes, .com did contribute a portion of that, but it was a combination of .com and really those first 3 weeks in December that were the softest in terms of that holiday timeframe. And as I mentioned, we were down about 1%, and in that timeframe, we were strong leading in, we were strong coming out. So we're highly confident that the core fundamentals of our business are really, really solid. And as we move into this year, we're going to continue to work really hard over the next 6 months to prepare and get our multichannel program together so that when we hit fall, we are really ready to go, and we expect then for that growth rate to exceed the company's growth rate, and it will be a positive contributor to our same-store sales increase instead of the other way around last quarter.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And just to be clear, .com hurt the comps in the quarter or did it still help, just not as much as you hoped?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, it hurt. It hurt the comp in the quarter, and the primary timeframe where it hurt the most was really in the November, first couple of weeks of December timeframe. And as we have added fixes to the website and maintained the stability and worked on things like site navigation, speed, page loading, waiting and the overall experience, we have seen our business on the .com site continue to get better. Our traffic on the site continues to be very, very good. So we're very encouraged about the fact that the guests still love coming to the website. What we were disappointing in was the experience once they got there, and so our conversion rates were not to where they had been in the past, and that aspect is what we've seen an improvement on over the last 6 or 8 weeks.","Douglas A. Scovanner","Excluding the super important 6- or 7-week period that we all focus on for the right reasons, excluding that for a moment, we've been running pretty consistent, 4%-plus same-store sales performance since the second quarter last year, while obviously our results don't exclude that period, and so we're working diligently to address that in 2012 and beyond.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. If I could, you talked about commodity inflation, how you guys managed that successfully. What do you think that aided the comp by if you were to take that average ticket growth for the year? I know at the year end, you guys usually have some sort of estimate summary.","Douglas A. Scovanner","We'll end up reflecting in our 10-K that inflation contributed a very immaterial amount aggregate to the picture in 2011. Now obviously, that picture was quite different by category, with much higher rates of inflation in some categories, think of anything involving cotton and most anything you eat, with continued deflation in lots of other categories mixing out to a trivial net figure.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","I'd also add that the peak quarters were really, second half of second quarter, all of third quarter, first half of second quarter and then we started seeing that inflationary pressure abate as we cycled through December, and now we're back to more reasonable traditional levels.","Douglas A. Scovanner","Importantly, despite all of the fears 6, 9, 12 months ago, that whole picture had no impact that we can see or measure on gross margin rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is on the PFresh remodels. And I'm just wondering if you take a look at the class of 2011 versus the class of 2010, I'm wondering if you could compare the performances for us?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","I would say that the performance, both of those class of stores were relatively consistent, give or take. They both met or exceeded our expectations. They were some of our larger stores in more of our denser suburban, urban trade areas. We continue to see very, very good results in year one conversion, year 2 are meeting our expectations. We're now having some stores that are just starting to cycle in year 3. As we move into year 2, we're starting to see the sales expand beyond just the Food categories into some, more of the other crossover and commodity categories. And as we move through year 2 and into 3 -- year 3, we're starting to see the increase in the discretionary categories that we had planned for over time as well. So we're on track and feel -- continue to feel really good about where we are with PFresh.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is that flow-through consistent with like the first batch of stores you did, like the, particularly the Philadelphia market?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Philadelphia was a little bit of an anomaly in that when we did Philadelphia, it was primarily about Food. We did not incorporate all of the other signature elements, the broader elements of the remodel that we incorporated in subsequent cycles. So we did far more on the visual elements in the store, carpeting, apparel fixtures, the shoe area, the beauty, home. None of those were added into or part of that Philadelphia test market. So as we go back and we will add that back over time in the Philadelphia market. So it really is not a clear indication of what the comprehensive PFresh performance was all about.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just if I missed this, how many remodels are you doing in '12?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","In '12, the number is in the neighborhood of 230.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick question.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","So down about 150 from last year.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And why are you decelerating the remodels?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, we have a -- we started with our suburban, urban, higher volume stores. And as over time, as we completed and we fill back into those market, we just believe that this cadence is a more appropriate cadence as we go forward, as we go into our -- some of our mid and lower volume stores. And secondly, we're working on a lower cost investment on some of these. And so we're just looking at just extending out the program a little bit. And we never were really all that specific in terms how long it was going to take to complete this program. We just feel, with everything else that's going on, it's the appropriate number for 2012.","Douglas A. Scovanner","Well, at a big picture level, for heaven sakes, we've already completed 60% of the stores.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Yes.","Douglas A. Scovanner","So 60% of our stores, excluding Super Target stores of course, that aren't relevant to this discussion. So even this year's program will convert 1\/3 of the remaining stores.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick question on credit. Your bad debt provision was up almost 2x from the third quarter, just wondering why. And then, looking ahead to '12, what would you expect that allowance as a percentage of period end receivables to become a year from now?","Douglas A. Scovanner","The expense -- I'll handle the 2011 question, I'll let John take care of the 2012. The expense was up for the precise reasons we laid out in this conference call at the beginning of the quarter. We have achieved a form of equilibrium of sorts, where our write-off rates are more or less in line with our allowance rates, and that's why you saw bad debt expense and write-offs right on top of each other during the quarter. We tried diligently to communicate this as clearly as we could at the beginning of the quarter. So behind us are the days where allowance reductions will add meaningfully to our results. For the 2012 comment, John?","John Mulligan","So for 2012, we expect -- we finished 2011 at about 6.5% or so allowance rate. And for 2012, we expect the year to finish pretty much right on that. So the only meaningful change in the reserve dollars will be due to the actual reserve balances coming back. But as Doug said, we feel like we've hit just about equilibrium here on net write-offs in delinquencies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Carroll with UBS.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know you talked about some sentiment issues around REDcard, how it continues to do well, penetration is there. Are there any additional, I guess, some of the numbers you can put around that in terms of the contribution to the comp? I mean, if you're still seeing kind of the sizable uptick in new card placements coming in?","Douglas A. Scovanner","There's a little bit of a different answer, debit versus credit. And one of the curious things that you'll see in our disclosed figures is that the year-over-year growth is now, give or take, 3\/4 in the debit card program and 1\/4 in the credit card program that is looking at penetration increases. But by the time you blend those together, certainly, there remains a very material percentage of the sales reflected in that penetration increase that are incremental sales. Maybe that's trailing off to 1\/3 given the mix, where it was once in the 40% to 50% range, but it's still a very important feature of our results.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I mean, if we were to do the math on that, to try and, I guess, just look at the contribution to the full quarter comp, do you guys have that number?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","We're not breaking out that specifically anymore because that is so integrated with PFresh, and it's really part of the core business sales driving tactics that we had. And because we have now gone through over 60% of our general merchandise stores, it's impossible to really break those out anymore in any meaningful way. So it's really one integrated strategy. Those are frequency driving strategies, and going forward, we're not going to be really talking about them in anything other than part of the core business driving sales programs that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A few questions. Gregg or I guess it's John, you mentioned that February, it sounds as if you're tracking well ahead of the 4% comp plan for the quarter. Maybe if you could give us what's driving that? Where are you seeing the strength come from, consumables versus discretionary, any color?","Kathryn A. Tesija","Yes, I can take that, Adrianne. It's really been across-the-board. We've seen, as Gregg mentioned, our discretionary businesses bounce back both in January and continuing on in February, as well as continued strength in our Grocery business, Beauty, the product areas where you've seen strength in the past. So it's really been across-the-board.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And a combination of traffic and ticket, it sounds like.","Kathryn A. Tesija","Correct.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","We'll give you the full details end of next week as well, but we're really pleased with where we are at this point in time in February. But as we noted in the comments, it's one month, we don't want to get too excited or too disappointed. And we're doing a lot of things right. We have a lot of really good sales driving initiatives. We're off to a good start. We finished the year with very clean in inventory. So our stores have been reset, and they are fashion fresh forward with our color campaign. Our stores are doing an awesome job of delivering a great guest experience. We hate to use weather a little bit, but it's been milder this year compared to some of the issues we had [indiscernible].","Douglas A. Scovanner","It's okay to confess once in a while that weather's favorable. Seriously, we won't know for several months how much of the apparel strength in February is pulling forward sales that otherwise might have occurred in March or April versus a little gift that we should all expect every once in a while.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my...","Gregg W. Steinhafel","But it's across the store. It's really solid.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Terrific. And then my other question relates to the competitive environment. Gregg, you characterized the holiday as intensely promotional. It obviously took its toll on your sales. It sounds as if we could look forward to ongoing pressure, besides Wal-Mart, obviously big changes from JCPenney. We just heard from Kohl's, some pretty significant price investment planned for their opening price point. It sounds as if you're planning a small gross margin decline for 2012. I'm wondering is that largely because of the mix shift -- ongoing mix shift that you expect. But having to think about merchandise margins in a world that continues to sound as if we're going to get increasingly competitive.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Well, I would separate the 6 weeks out of holiday compared to the other 46-plus weeks out of the year. It is just a period in and of itself. And so everybody makes price investment and is aggressive throughout the year. We saw that throughout 2011. But it goes to such a heightened sense during the holiday, and then it typically backs down to a more normal cadence, still aggressive but still more normal. That pattern is what we have consistently seen. That's the period that we're in. All of our retail competitors make investment in price on an ongoing basis. That's really nothing new. We do the same thing. We invest billions of dollars a year in our promotional markdown and delivering great value day in and out and that's going to continue. So most of the rate decline that you were talking about going forward in 2012 is it relates to the mix issues associated with our traffic driving strategies and not any significant change in the promotional environment.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So following on that, Gregg, does it sound as if the 3% comp for the year, we should expect it to be a bit more front-end loaded and perhaps rethink of the cadence of sales for the holiday period?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Yes, I think that's a fair way to look at it. I think that our internal expectation is, let's really get ahead, let's really try and deliver in excess of that number. And then I think that when we get in the holiday, first of all, it's the peak sales month, and it's very difficult to repeat that same kind of sales momentum consistently in the largest month of the year. And the dynamics are such that so much is around that Thanksgiving weekend, and then it goes into a lull and then there's that big finish at the end, the last 7 or 8 days, and it's just -- we just don't think it's reasonable for us to be planning our business at the same kinds of sales trend that we've experienced up and to that. So we're going to take a more modest approach during that timeframe. We're still going to try and capture as much share as we possibly can. But we're going to continue to do like we did this year and prior years, and that's making sure that we are not just driving sales at any cost, that we are appropriately trying to gain market share profitably and being disciplined in our approach to the marketplace. And if that means slightly softer comps during that timeframe, we think that's a good trade-off to make because we are not going to get into this race to the bottom and give it away at all cost and to try and capture sales, lumping significantly below cost with the whole store on sale and things like that. That's just not our strategy. We don't think it's healthy over the long term, and so we are really trying to find that right balance between driving sales and maintaining the current high level, strong levels of profitability in our EBITDA and EBIT margin rates.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my last question relates to the management team. It sounds as if we're all looking forward to meeting John, I guess, next week. But any updates in terms of the marketing role, when we can expect that role to be filled?","Gregg W. Steinhafel","No, there's really nothing that I can really share. This is in progress, and we're being very disciplined and thorough in our approach, as you would expect us to. And as soon as I have something or we have something to share, we'll communicate that broadly to everybody.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First question on gross margin. Just in the fourth quarter, can you help us out a little bit on -- it sounded like the underlying gross margin x the impacts from PFresh and REDcard was up. Obviously, it was a disciplined promotional stance. But can you give us any quantification of what the underlying margins did and how you were looking at the impact from the collective RED-Fresh initiatives?","Douglas A. Scovanner","The measured impact as best we can measure them is that PFresh and 5% Rewards combined drove a gross margin rate decline a little higher, slightly higher than the aggregate reported results. And excluding those impacts, there was a slight amount of mix deterioration and a larger benefit from rate improvement within categories. But by any measure, the lion's share of our gross margin rate change on a net basis was driven by the impacts of those strategies.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then a couple of questions for Kathy. Firstly, I guess in the near term, with the improvement in sales momentum you've seen since the holidays, is there anything changing in the characterization in terms of your price points, good, better, best? It sounds like your best -- your greatest share gain was from your best customers. Are you seeing any improvement as you can tell in terms of merchandise assortment or guest improvement?","Kathryn A. Tesija","In the discretionary side of our business, we have seen some improvement in our better and best price points. And so you'll see that in fashion with some of our more fashionable collections as well as the must-have items. You'll also see it in Home in some of our better brands, Fieldcrest, for example, Smith & Hawken, which I've talked about before, C9 and Activewear. So we are definitely starting to see some movement, and that's one of our key objectives for 2012. We've had very strong results throughout the recession in our good price point and better, but we'd like to see increasing strength in better and best, and we have started to see that movement.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then longer term, the consumer electronics category and the larger media category has obviously been a significant and persistent drag. Can you just talk about any strategies you have that you think might be able to alleviate that, and obviously, there's some structural secular issues at work there.","Kathryn A. Tesija","Yes, there is a lot going on in those industries, and in particular, some that we are very strong on given our family orientation, like video games for example. So you have seen us over the past year make some changes there with space, adding in cellphones, expanding that section, going deeper into Apple product, which performs very well with our guests, with the iPods and iPad, iPhone, et cetera. And you also saw us work through a reinvention on the entertainment side, decreasing some of the space, devoting more to children, which is our strength, and we've seen some improved results in both of those areas because of that. But clearly, as you stated, there's issues across the industry. And we need to continue to work on staying ahead of that as best we can, going after the things that are working and in entertainment working on exclusives and products that our guests -- really resonate with our guests. Like for example, you saw our exclusive with Adele, and that came out a year ago with her 21 album and we were able to re-release it with the award ceremony this year and have had terrific results. So I think we need to continue to stay on that and do more of it.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, and then finally and then I'll get off here. Just in the Home category, would you expect to comp positive in 2012 in that category?","Kathryn A. Tesija","Well, I don't know that we're prepared to state a number for Home, but it has been improving and I would say at least flat, if not up, here coming in the next year. We've made a lot of improvements already, and we've seen, as I said earlier, some stronger results in our Housewares business as well as our seasonal business, so we're very pleased with that and we're going to continue to capitalize on that, particularly with the strength in the kitchen side of the business with our PFresh remodels. And what we're working on now is getting the more discretionary side, domestic, .com up to better numbers. And part of that, as I talked about a minute ago, is increasing the value in our home brand which are better price points and continuing the success we see [ph] in our best price points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.","Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Doug, I just had a question for you on credit and then Kathy, I have a follow-up question around the fourth quarter. Doug, some of the discussions we have with some of the potential buyers of Credit Card portfolios were talking about the changes in the regs would potentially require a retail partner to have some type of liability in the future in the event a retail portfolio cards became unprofitable. And so my question is, are you hearing that and was that a stumbling block in trying to get a deal done? And if so, how you get past that? Or can you give us some idea of why you think maybe later this year, you can get a deal done? And then again, I've got a question for Kathy.","Douglas A. Scovanner","That really isn't driven by the regs. It's certainly a fact that some other retailers have structured deals in a way that compensates them higher in the short run in exchange for incurring a potentially meaningful amount of risk in the event that portfolios melt down. That isn't driven by the regs, it's driven by deal structures willingly entered into by others. So we could do one of those deals, we could do some other form of deal, but that's not really a factor one way or the other in getting a deal done.","Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, so you -- that's ultimate for a potential liability wouldn't prevent you from getting a deal done. Is that the way I should take what you're saying?","Douglas A. Scovanner","What you should take away I'm saying is, we have the option of structuring a deal either way. And some retailers have structured deals in one fashion and some have structured it in the other fashion, obviously in exchange for incurring a downside risk. I would assume that the retailers who have that risk are getting a much larger ongoing payment stream. It's a form of insurance, if you will. But it has nothing to do with whether or not we can get a deal done. We could easily structure a deal either way if we elected to.","Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Kathy, I was just -- as you think about December or that 6-week period there, is there an opportunity for you to move more of the new launches into that period, particularly in the early part of December so that you're not just competing on price, more about innovation and maybe more full price selling around those new launches as opposed to where they've lined up in the past?","Kathryn A. Tesija","Wayne, we're looking at that, but I would tell you a little bit more broadly, we're looking at just gifting in general and how we've gone to market, particularly in Home but somewhat in apparel. So I don't -- I can't tell you at this point what our design partnerships will look like for the back half, but we are definitely considering appropriate things that our guests would be interested in for that December timeframe where we think we can pick up some more business in the gift-giving categories.","Gregg W. Steinhafel","Okay. That concludes Target's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for your participation.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 18, 2016.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Brian will discuss our first quarter performance including results across our merchandise categories. Then John will provide an update on our efforts to improve in-stocks and build our supply-chain capabilities, and finally Cathy will offer more detail on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also, in these remarks we refer to adjusted earnings per share which is a non-GAAP financial measure. And return on invested capital which is a ratio based on GAAP information with the exception of adjustments made to capitalized operating leases. Reconciliations to our GAAP EPS and our GAAP total rent expense are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the first quarter and our priorities going forward. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I start with the prepared remarks, let me set up the structure for our call this morning. We\u2019ve to make sure we spend significant time talking about our first quarter results and Cathy and John and I will cover both our first quarter performance and also talk about the second quarter outlook. But we are going to make sure we leave significant time for Q&A. I\u2019m going to make sure we have time today to address your questions provide additional insights into our first quarter performance and the factors that are guiding our outlook for Q2.","Let me start with the first quarter. Our team delivered outstanding first quarter financial results in a very challenging consumer environment which became softer and more volatile as the quarter progressed. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was well beyond the high end of the guidance for the quarter, and more than 16% ahead of the $1.10 last year. These results demonstrate the value of our strategy in the face of more challenging consumer landscape.","First quarter comparable sales growth was driven by an increase in both traffic and average ticket as traffic grew in both our stores and digital channels. Comparable digital sales grew 23% in the first quarter on top of 38% a year ago. We generated very healthy profit margins on our sales in the quarter, as our team did a great job managing the business in the face of a number of headwinds, particularly following the Easter holiday.","As planned, our first quarter gross margin rate reflected the benefit for the sale of our pharmacy business, favorable merchandising mix and our cost savings initiatives. These benefits allowed us to offset markdown pressure in a very promotional environment. The team also delivered on the expense line, which benefitted from the pharmacy sale and cost initiatives offsetting pressure from investments we\u2019ve made in our business including our team. Cathy will provide more detail in a few minutes.","Sales in the quarter came in lighter than expected and daily and regional shopping patterns were more volatile than the entire periods. While guests generally maintain their pattern of larger, pantry stocking visits, we thought slowdown in growth of smaller convenient trips. Against that background our results show that our strategy continues to resonate with our guests as comparable sales in our signature categories: style, baby, kids and wellness grew more than three times as fast as the company average.","Given the concentration of signature categories in home and apparel, comparable sales in both categories outperformed the company, driving market share gains in both areas. Comps in home grew nearly 4% led by strength in domestics, d\u00e9cor and seasonal areas. Highlights included our kids home assortment which saw comp sales in the mid-teens, driven by the successful launch of our new Pillowfort brand.","We were also pleased with the results from our partnership with Marimekko which attracted guests to explore our assortment in stores and digital, driving sales in both home and apparel. Overall, comps and apparel grew between 2% and 3%, led by sales in Baby, Kids and women\u2019s ready-to-wear. Rapid growth and ready-to-wear is especially notable, given the tough comparison from last year specifically two-year stack of the first quarter comp sales in ready-to-wear is more than 16% higher than two years ago.","First quarter comps in food were down slightly as an increase in perishable was offset by a decline in center store grocery. While results were impacted by deflation in some categories, they also reflected a meaningful disruption from the reset of our center store grocery area, which was executed in stores across the country in April. Despite the disruption, this effort better positions us for success over the longer term, as we\u2019ve implemented changes to assortment, presentation and category adjacencies.","Specifically, we\u2019ve updated assortment and segmentation to align with local demographics and showcase wellness. And we integrated nutrition bars into the center store floor pad creating an industry leading destination for these items. In total, we added about a 1000 new items with this reset, including 55 new better-for-you brands across 25 categories and we\u2019ve incorporated our simply balanced brand into an additional 30 categories. This represents an important step in the reinvention of our grocery business. Following the reset we received very positive guest feedback and the subsequent results have been better than expected.","Within hardlines, we saw a high single digit increase in the first quarter of comparable sales and toys, even as we comped over high single digit growth last year. Offsetting the growth in toys we saw declines in electronics and entertainment reflecting the secular challenges these categories continue to face. These declines put about 70 basis points of pressure on our first quarter comparable sales growth.","I want to pause and welcome Mark Tritton, who will be joining our team as the EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer, overseeing our enterprise buying, sourcing, product design, development and merchandising operations. We have conducted an exhaustive search for a new CMO and I\u2019m confident Mark is the right leader for our merchandizing team. Mark comes to us with a wealth of retail and merchandizing experience, including positions at Nike, Timberland and Nordstrom where Mark doubled their private label business. Mark is a bold, decisive and visionary retail leader and we are excited to have him on our Target team. ","Once again this quarter, we were able to return a compelling amount of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Altogether, we returned more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, up from just under $900 million a year ago. In addition, given our strong financial position this quarter we are able to refinance some high cost debt by issuing new debt at very attractive rates. Cathy will provide more detail in a few minutes.","As we look ahead, we are approaching our business with appropriate caution as sales trends at Target and many of our key competitors weakened and became more volatile in the first quarter. In addition, many of our competitors were sitting on meaningful excess inventory which we expect will extend a very intense promotional environment into the months ahead.","Despite our near term caution we\u2019ll continue to execute the long term strategy vision that we laid out 18 months ago, the vision which has been shaping our results ever since. We are very excited about the launch of our new kid\u2019s apparel brand, Cat & Jack which will roll out in the second quarter and we\u2019ll continue to invest in quality through our own and exclusive brand assortment with a particular emphasis on signature categories.","We\u2019ll continue to work to enhance our food offering to become more fresh and local with more natural and clean label offerings and we\u2019ll continue to partner with our colleagues at CVS to complete the rebranding of our pharmacies within our stores. Following the rebranding effort, we\u2019ll collaborate with CVS on an awareness campaign to ensure that both our guests and members of their PBM businesses are aware of the change within our stores.","As John will describe in a few minutes, we\u2019re also investing in store experience and flexible fulfillment capabilities, while modernizing our supply chain to become more agile in the way we serve our guests. We\u2019re very excited to be near completion of our LA 25 remodels, which began more - before the holiday season and we are eager to gain guest feedbacks to determine which enhancements we\u2019ll roll out more broadly in the future.","And finally, we are making investments in our team, adding specialized talent like new visual merchandizing leaders who are ensuring the store presentation and our style categories highlight the investments we are making to enhance quality and innovation.","Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to simplify processes in our stores, freeing up time for our team to focus on serving our guests. ","Before I turn the call over to John, I want to thank the entire Target team for their tireless work on behalf of our business and our guests. As we\u2019ve said many times, we have the best team in retail, both in our stores and in our headquarters, and I\u2019m continually inspired by their passion to drive Target success by better serving our guests. With this outstanding team, a strong brand, great looking stores, a resilient business model and a strong balance sheet, I am confident we\u2019ll successfully navigate the near term regional environment as we implement strategies that will drive Target\u2019s long term success.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John who will discuss his team\u2019s efforts to modernize our supply chain and improve our operations. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to provide an update on our efforts to reduce out-of-stocks and improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain. Then I\u2019ll cover our current work to enable our existing supply chain infrastructure to operate more flexibly in support of our strategy. And finally, I\u2019ll turn to our efforts to elevate the store experience on behalf of our guests, including enhancements to the order pick up process.","Many of you have told us that you have noticed the improvement in our in-stock position in our stores, and our internal measures confirm which you have been seeing, specifically in the first quarter we saw a 27% improvement in out-of-stock measures compared with the first quarter last year. This represents a sequential acceleration from our fourth quarter performance and we are seeing improvements across all of our merchandised categories.","Some of the in-stock improvement is being driven by additional inventory investments in central categories which drove a portion of our year-over-year increase in our inventory at the end of the quarter, however we have opportunities to make other changes that will allow us to streamline our inventory position overtime. Specifically the team is taking a data driven approach to reduce the number of skews in our assortment making room for additional facings of the best selling, faster turning items on our store shells. In addition, the team is collaborating with vendors to reduce case tax [ph] sizes which will reduce back-room inventory while increasing store labor efficiency by reducing the number of times and items touched before it\u2019s displayed on shelves. Beyond these improvements the out-of-stock team has successfully tested other enhancements that will roll out later this year.","One test applied new replenishment algorithms for items of the regular demand patterns like seasonal sporting goods, and the results of the tests are dramatic as out-of-stocks improved by 50% on test items. Another test involves updates to our presentation standards for items that are typically purchased in multiples. This ensures that our minimum standards reflect the way guests are shopping today allowing us to better optimize the trade-off between inventory investments and out-of-stocks.","And with our vendor partners the team has worked meaningfully reduce shipping windows which will enhance speed and reliability throughout the supply chain. We are very pleased with the cooperation we have seen from our vendors on this effort and improving shipment windows will be implemented across all merchandised categories by this fall.","Beyond our work on in-stocks, we are making changes in our distribution centers to modernize our capabilities. These changes will allow our existing infrastructure to operate more flexibly, simultaneously reducing chipping times while efficiently leveraging our entire network inventory on behalf of our guests.","At our financial community meeting in March, I outlined the conversion of three of our traditional regional distribution centers into delayed allocation centers which can house slower turning items with more variable demand following the remaining VCs to process faster training skews more efficiently.","In addition, these delayed allocation centers allow us to post the right amount of seasonal inventory across the country throughout the season as demand patterns emerge, keeping us in-stock longer in areas of unexpectedly high demand or reducing excess inventory in areas of unexpectedly low demand.","We have successfully completed the conversion of all three delayed allocation centers in the first quarter and early results indicate that these additional nodes are improving product allocation compared with our past performance.","Among our other regional DCs this year we are making changes to three facilities to enable them to shift directly to guests. This requires a meaningful transformation in the capabilities of these facilities as direct to guest shipments require the team to pick and pack individual items while shipments to stores require fast moving shipments of case packs and pallets.","Despite the challenge, we are excited about this work, because like our ship from store capability, the ability to ship from our regional VCs directly to guests provides deeper access to network inventory, enhancing our digital in-stocks while allowing us to reach our guests more quickly while controlling costs.","In addition, adding direct ship capability to one of our existing facilities requires 85% lower capital investment compared to the construction of a new dedicated web fulfillment center. As you know, a meaningful portion of our capital expenditures in recent years has been devoted to technology and supply chain, and we said that we expect these investments to continue in the future.","At the same time, we know that investments in our store experience are more important than ever and as a result nearly $1 billion of our CapEx this year will be focused on the store experience. In addition to our store remodel program, which includes the LA 25 stores Brian highlighted earlier we continue to rollout new flexible format stores in dense, urban and suburban areas. And we are really pleased with the performance of these new hyper localized stores so far. In addition, we continue to invest in presentation and experience across a broad set of our stores.","This year we are investing in self checkout lanes, operational enhancements and merchandizing innovations across a meaningful portion of the store base. A key area of focus in our stores is the elevation of our digital order pickup and the team is taking steps to make the process more convenient and less transactional for our guests. Our goal in these efforts is to increase satisfaction with the order pick up experience leading to more repeat usage of this capability by our guests.","Speed is key, and our store teams continue to improve the speed with which they fill pick up orders. In the first quarter, approximately 90% of orders were ready for pick up in less than an hour, up nearly 10 percentage points from last year. This is one reason that guest satisfaction regarding the pickup experience is up meaningfully from last year and repeat usage is increasing as well.","Despite this progress, we have more work to do and we intend to continually improve our performance in response to guest feedback. To maintain our momentum, we rolled out streamlined order pickup communication to our guest this month, and in select stores we are testing a separate pickup area with additional holding capacity, dedicated team members and enhanced merchandised presentation to encourage additional shopping on their store visit.","While we are still early in our efforts, I am really pleased with the progress we have made in a short amount of time by focusing on downstream outcomes and improving handoffs between every part of the supply chain from vendor to distribution center to our stores we are making systematic, repeatable improvement which will sustain better operating metrics overtime.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Cathy who will share her insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook going forward. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks, John and good morning everyone. As Brian mentioned, we generated very strong financial results in the first quarter, even in the face of an unexpectedly choppy and weak environment. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.29 was $0.19 higher than last year and $0.04 better than the high end of our guidance. First quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.02, $0.27 lower than the adjusted EPS reflecting $0.26 of losses related to our debt tender offer and $0.01 of expense related to the sale of our pharmacy business.","Our first quarter comparable sales increase of 1.2% was driven by growth both growth in traffic and ticket, average ticket. As expected, total sales declined from last year reflecting the sale of our pharmacy business. Within the quarter, we experienced solid results through the Easter holiday; post Easter sales and traffic trends softened noticeably consistent with what you\u2019ve heard from many of our competitors. Also notable in the first quarter we saw a meaningful increase in the volatility of our weekly sales performance compared with last year.","Not surprisingly weather patterns caused some of this volatility as we saw a meaningful correlation between sales and temperature trend in different regions of the country. We continue to invest in our digital and flexible fulfillment capabilities to drive sales in all channels and we continue to see strong results. Comparable, digital sales increased 23% in the first quarter on top of the 38% increase a year ago.","REDcard penetration was 23.4% in the first quarter, up nearly 200 basis points from last year. This represents the addition of nearly 700,000 new credit and debit accounts in the quarter, combined with the impact of the sale of the pharmacy business. Excluding the impact of the pharmacy sale penetration was up about 80 basis points from a year ago. Our team delivered a stronger than expected 11.5% EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter.","On the gross margin line, we saw about 50 basis points of improvement from last year, this growth reflects the benefit of the sale of the pharmacy business and continued positive merchandise mix driven by strength in signature category. These benefits offset markdown pressure in an environment which continues to be very promotional.","On the SG&A line we saw the benefit of strong discipline across the organization along with the benefit from the sale of the pharmacy business. This allowed us to offset strategic investments we are making in our business including our team. Altogether, first quarter SG&A expense was about 50 basis points better than last year.","Quarter end inventory was up a little bit more than 4% rising faster than sales [ph]. As John mentioned, some of this growth reflected intentional inventory investment in to support in-stock in essential categories. However, given the recent slowdown in our sales and our caution regarding the second quarter, we are planning to manage inventory carefully throughout this quarter and beyond.","Turning to capital deployment, we returned $336 million to shareholders in the form of dividends this quarter and invested nearly $900 million in share repurchase. As Brian mentioned we also took the opportunity to refinance some high coupon debt during the quarter with the issuance of 10 year and 30 year bond at very attractive rates. As a result, we recognized $261 million in debt retirement losses in the first quarter GAAP EPS and given that the settlement on the last tranche of the debt tender occurred at the beginning of the second quarter we expect to recognize another $161 million of debt retirement losses in the second quarter GAAP EPS.","Beyond these accounting losses we expect this refinancing to reduce our ongoing interest expense by $5 million to $10 million per quarter. I want to pause here and discuss our quarter end cash position. We ended the first quarter with about $4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, essentially the same as when we started the quarter. However this was the result of timing, and we expect to reduce our cash position by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter. In fact, already this quarter we have deployed nearly $1 billion to retire the final tranche of the debt tender and we expect to apply another $750 million to fund a debt maturity in July.","When you combine these uses with continued investments in the dividend and share repurchase we expect to end the second quarter with a cash balance of between $1 billion and $2 billion. I want to emphasize that our capital deployment priorities remain the same. We invest first in our business to support projects that meets our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and expect to maintain our record of consecutive annual dividend increases since 1971. And finally, we invest in share purchase within the limit of our single A long-term credit rating.","One of our longer term financial goals is to increase our after tax return on invested capital. And we expect to reach the mid-teens or higher in the next five years. And I'm pleased that we are already making meaningful progress on this metric.","For the 12 months period through the first quarter we reported an after tax return of 16% including the gain on the pharmacy sale in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding that gain, our after tax return on invested capital was a very strong 14% in the first quarter, up about 150 basis points from a year ago.","On another note our effective income tax from continuing operations was unusually low in the first quarter at 31.6%. This was a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard for employee share-based payments, which reduce our tax expense by $70 million combined with the impact of lower pretax earnings resulting from the loss on debt retirement.","Now, let's turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the implications for the full year. While we're coming off a quarter of outstanding financial performance, Brian mentioned earlier with elevated short-term volatility and softer sales trends since Easter, it\u2019s clear that consumers are behaving more cautiously.","With that backdrop, we are planning for second quarter comparable sales of flat to down 2%. This would represents lower than second quarter performance than we were planning at the beginning of the year. But we believe this outlook is prudent given the trends we see as many others have been seeing.","Given lower than expected sales, we are planning for a moderate year-over-year decline in our second quarter EBITDA margin rate in a range of 40 basis points at the midpoint of our comp guidance, compared with our plan going into the year, our updated expectations reflect continued growth margin pressure from a very commercial environment combined with the deleveraging of SG&A expense on slower sales.","All together we expect to generate second quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1.00 to a $1.20. Given our performance over the last year and half, we believe we're pursuing the right strategy and our strategy is working. We have many levers we can deploy to drive our performance even if the environment remains challenging.","As a results even with a more tempered view of the second quarter, we are still focused on achieving full year adjusted EPS within the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. As we progress to the second quarter all of us will gain more perspective which will inform our outlook for the latter half of the year.","As I mentioned at our Financial Community Meeting, one of my first priorities on joining this team last year was to dig in and understand in detail the factors that drive Target Financial performance.","As a result of that view I'm confident in the resilience of our business model which sustains our business through all consumer and retail environments. Importantly, our financial strength combined with our business model enable us to continue investing in our long-term priorities, even when others are having to pull back. It\u2019s one of the many reasons I was still excited to join this team and this company last September. ","With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Brian, John and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Hi. Two questions. Thanks Brian, I think John, and Cathy you all gave a nice overview there when you described how the quarter progressed. Could you help us understand where April was, was it actually negative, and also any geographic distinctions that you saw in the quarter? Then I had a follow-up on the margin.","Cathy Smith","Hey, Greg, I'll start. We did see \u2013 obviously we had a very strong February and March and felt really great around our performance in each year. We saw that we took share in apparel in Easter and so we're really good there. But we did see a slowdown in April. A lot of it though is that ad shift that we were seeing, so that's part of what we're seeing with regard to April, but we did see slowdown throughout the course of April.","Brian Cornell","And Greg, let me provide some color as far as the geographic volatility. And I'm going to be really transparent with some of the examples. And as we looked at business in April, and again in the start of May, we've seen a significant performance difference between our West Coast markets and particularly our Northeast markets, and significant variability, where we've seen some very positive growth performance across our entire portfolio, in Los Angeles, in San Francisco and many of our core West Coast markets, offset by significant slowness in the Northeast, in Boston, in New York, in Philadelphia, in D.C.","And given categories, we've seen dramatic performance differences. In the ready-to-wear categories, on the West Coast and in parts of the Midwest we've seen an earlier spring. We're seeing double-digit growth in ready-to-wear, offset by fairly significant declines in the Northeast. We had a review with our team yesterday. We looked at categories like fans. We have markets that are up 20% and markets that are down 90%.","So, we're seeing volatility driven by certainly climate but I think a number of other factors that we're certainly analyzing. Cathy talked about on earlier Easter. We've certainly looked at weather patterns. We recognized the year-on-year fuel prices have increased and our guest and the consumer are spending than they did a year ago at the pump. And we're certainly recognized that within overall categories today's consumer, our guest is reinvesting in their homes. They're spending money on home improvement. We've seen that in our home category, which was up 4% in the first quarter. So, a lot of volatility and it\u2019s both geographic and within category mixes.","Greg Melich","That's great. That's helpful. I guess there's also a transition into the margin if I got your guidance right, the midpoint of it, if I take the comp and to get to that EPS, I get EBIT margins down [indiscernible] in the second quarter. One, is that right? And two, it sounds like the real reason for that might be a little bit of deleverage and then basically markdown risk on inventory given the rest of your comment. Is that fair?","Cathy Smith","Greg, I'm really sorry, but you literally cut out right when you said, what you were trying to ask about EBIT margins, so I'm sorry, can you please repeat.","Greg Melich","Yes. It looks from the guidance EBIT margin is down 50 bps in the second quarter of the midpoint, I guess, how much of that is just deleverage and how much of that is markdown risk from the elevated inventories and categories?","Cathy Smith","Yes. So we did talk about gross margin. We expect gross margin to be 40 basis points at the midpoint, and we still expect a promotional environment and we're planning for that.","Brian Cornell","Greg, I think, under the circumstances as we've looked at our competitor's reports, we recognized there is significant inventory in the marketplace. We expect the second quarter to continue to be very promotional and that's factored into our guidance for the second quarter.","Greg Melich","That's great. Thanks a lot. Good luck.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thanks for all the details. We had a question regarding the smaller convenience trip slowdown. Could you just help us understand as you look at the data if there is patterns there that give you some insight into how that dynamic maybe playing out and what's the opportunity there?","And secondly, on promotional pressure that you're seeing what's the axes from which that maybe happening in terms of (NYSE:A) categories, and (NYSE:B) Amazon versus brick-and-mortar competition. Are there different aspects of competition that you're facing as you look to determine what's optimal from a execution and strategic point of view? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Oliver, let me address the trips. We talked about in the prepared comments. We continue to see very strong performance in what we'll describe as that stock-up trip where as a company we performed very well throughout 2015 and again in the first quarter of 2016. We have seen some trip erosion is with the guest who is coming in for that fill-in-trip. So, as we think about actions we're taking in our business right now, we want to continue to make sure we're serving the guest who is looking for that stock-up item, that stock-up trip. And we're going to be even more focused as we manage through the quarter in the balance of the year to make sure we're winning and driving more fill-in trips.","So, you'll see us enhance and change both our promotional calendar, our in-store presentation of more fill-in items to make sure that we're doing both, continuing to win with the quest who is shopping Target for that stock-up occasion, but also making sure we're capturing more of that fill-in-trip throughout the quarter.","So, those are actions that we're taking right now. The team is working on, making adjustments in our promotional cadence and presentation to make sure that we're doing both. We're continuing to win with the stock-up shopper but we're also capturing more share of wallet with that fill-in guest.","From a promotional standpoint, we would expect to see most of the intensity in the apparel space, where we certainly recognize that many of our competitors are sitting on high levels of inventory, we've got to be prepared for continued promotional intensity in the space. And I think we're well-positioned as both Cathy and John have noted to manage through that throughout the quarter.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up, as you been monitoring and you've been really ahead of thinking in terms of the omni-channel experience. Brian, are there any little changes that you've been seeing in terms of how customers view convenience or what you're seeing now in terms of the online plus offline experience that are different in terms of like the trends you've been recognizing?","Brian Cornell","Well, I think, Oliver, the one thing that we continue to see and we've embraced as an organization is whether our guest is shopping in-store or online, it starts digitally. So, we continue to make sure we're investing in our digital assets to make sure we're providing the ease and convenience for our guests whether they're in store or shopping online.","It's why we make such a commitment as John talked about too, enhancing our order online, pickup and store capabilities. It's why we elevated our focus on making sure that we provide an easy shopping experience for guest online. We continue to build out those capabilities. So, we recognize that even as we look at the start of 2016, the majority of the retail business in United States continues to be done in stores, but it starts online, so we better have great digital capabilities to make sure when our guest is shopping target, no matter how they shop, we make it a convenient, easy experience.","So that has not changed dramatically. And one of the numbers that we feel best about in the first quarter is the fact that on top of a very strong 38% growth in the first quarter of 2015, we grew our digital sales by 23%. So we're continuing to connect with the guest who wants to shop Target online and we'll continue to invest and build our capabilities in that space. ","Oliver Chen","Thank you. ","Brian Cornell","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group.","Joe Feldman","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask Brian, if you could talk a little about the in-fill trips again, wanted to go back to Cartwheel, if I recall, I don't think you've mentioned it on the call this time. And I just wondering if there's any changes going on there or what you're doing, presumably that would be a way to help stimulate the infill trips like localization personalize marketing. I know you guys do a great job with that, with your mobile efforts. So, did something kind of fall apart on that front or maybe some things weren't as effective. Could you talk about that a little?","Brian Cornell","Well, Joe, in some ways you're looking inside of our current playbook, and certainly as we think about winning more trips with that fill-in-guest, Cartwheel plays an incredibly important role. And we'll continue to make sure that we activate Cartwheel to drive those trips and meet that guest needs.","One of the things that were certainly recognizing as we look at 2016 shopping patterns is there is a consumer and a guest who continues to look for value and that value is expressed in more fill-in-trips, buying smaller packs, smaller baskets, so again it\u2019s not a shift in our strategy, it\u2019s a recognition that we have to do both. We have to continue to delight the guest when they come to Target for that big stock-up occasion and we have to have right assortment, the right value, the right presentation for that guest who is coming to us for the fill-in-trip.","So, Cartwheel plays a very important role in that. And as we think about adjustments in modifications we're making to our plans Cartwheel plays a very important role in driving more trips, back to our stores and certainly meeting the needs of our guest who is coming to us for that fill-in occasion.","Joe Feldman","Got it. Thanks. And then, you guys mentioned that the center store disruption and all of the efforts you made \u2013 that you are making to improve the healthy living in that category, I guess will you able to quantify how much of an impact that had? Presumably, it was a decent disruption in April that could have a bit of a drag.","Brian Cornell","Joe, it was a significant disruption. Our stores. The layout. And for all of our center store dry grocery items, we moved every one of those aisles in all of our stores. So, significant disruption for the guest, short-term, it certainly has an impact on our performance in grocery and food, but as we've made the changes the response we're seeing from the guest is very encouraging.","They are recognizing the new assortment, the new brands, more local items, the fact that we have more organic and gluten free items on our shelves and in many of these categories like the significant change we made in bars, we're seeing very strong sales results coming out of the reset.","So it was an investment we had to make in both labor and in disruption to make sure we continue to move forward in the reinvention of food. So, short term, it had a meaningful impact on our food sales, but we certainly expect to see the recovery over the balance of this year as we provide a more relevant assortment to our target grocery shopper.","Joe Feldman","That's helpful. Thank you guys and good luck with this quarter.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Kate McShane from Citi Research.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Chris filling in for Kate. With the comp coming in below your expectations is there a reason why you didn't choose to get more promotional this quarter. Could you walk us through how much of your gross margin was impacted by promotions and was it more than last year?","Cathy Smith","Yes. We were -- as promotional was necessary we drove as we shared 4% comp in our Signature categories, which are the areas that tend to be more promotional. So we feel very good about our promotional cadence. Continue to work on being more and more effective, but still have a long way to go there. So, I won't say that we saved any promotions in particular we were promotional as we thought it was appropriate and it showed up in our comp.","Brian Cornell","And Chris, I'd only add that as we look at individual category performance, we felt like we were very competitive in categories like apparel where as we look at the NPD data, we look at the market share results we are one of the big market share winners in the first quarter. And clearly in apparel we picked up market share, the two weeks leading up to Easter, during the Easter week and the week following.","So, our assortment, our presentation, our promotions certainly connected with the guest and in important Signature categories we continue to advance market share, but we feel particularly good in a tough apparel environment that we post a positive comps, we grew market share and importantly we grew market share before during and after the important Easter Holiday, which is a critically important holiday for the apparel category.","Unidentified Analyst","And just looking ahead you mentioned I guess apparels is going to be very competitive. Are there any other categories you see that will also face pricing competition? And also just really quickly, for your in-stock initiatives how did the improvement in those initiatives contribute to the comp in Q1?","Brian Cornell","Well, on the in-stock question I think it's hard to parse [ph] that out, a very difficult question to answer. Certainly we have some estimates internally, but it gets into trading behavior as you know and how guest will trade out. But overall I think the in-stock definitely having it there when the guest wants it, but more important than that is ensuring that they trust us that no matter when they come in the store we'll have what they want, and that's about building trust for the brand over the long term. And so there is an immediate impact, but this is much more about being sure we're reliable all the time for the guest.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird.","Peter Benedict","Hi, guys. Just a clarification, just on the second quarter gross margin outlook, I think you said down 40 basis points, assume that's on a reported basis, its right. So excluding the pharmacy impact that would be down, maybe closer to 100? Am I right on that?","Cathy Smith","I thought I said gross margin \u2013 we really \u2013 I meant 40 basis points as EBITDA. So we should see actually a slight uptick in gross margin, a slight downtick in SG&A and then EBITDA was the 40 basis points. So thanks for asking that for clarification.","Peter Benedict","Perfect. Thank you. That's helpful. And then on \u2013 just on SG&A, is it fair to say that the SG&A dollars if you exclude the pharmacy comparisons were down slightly year-over-year in the first quarter? And I'm just curious if that's the trend that you think it persist over the balance of the year given the tougher sales environment?","Cathy Smith","Yes. The team did a great job of managing expense in the first quarter and we'll continue to do that. And yes, it was down year-over-year and we'll continue to manage our expenses.","Peter Benedict","Okay. Last question, I apologize if I miss this. Any change to the CapEx plan for the year, which I think was around a $1 billion - 1.8 sorry?","Cathy Smith","For 1.8, no change at all.","Peter Benedict","Okay. Terrific. Thanks guys.","Brian Cornell","Peter, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Hi. Good morning. I guess I'd just follow-on Peter's last question, but when you look at the sales results that you had the last few \u2013 the last few weeks and especially April. Does that make you rethink your longer term sales views that you laid out back in March?","Brian Cornell","Bob, it doesn't. And obviously it's been a question we've asked ourselves and as Cathy and John have both mentioned, we feel very good about the progress we're making from a strategic standpoint. We talked multiple times now. Certainly, we talk to most of you on the call during our March Investor Day. Our continued focus on building out our digital capabilities, we're making very good progress there. We think those are going to be essential to our future.","We feel very good about the progress we're making on Signature categories where we continue to build market share and drive differentiation. We're very excited about the early results of Pillowfort and feels that when we launch our new Cat and Jack brands for kids that is going to be another potential $1 billion brand in our portfolio, so great progress from a category roll and Signature category standpoint.","As John mentioned during his remarks, our flex formats continue to be very well received as we move into new urban markets. We're excited about our Tribeca store will open up in October, but we've been excited about every one of these new flex formats and they've been well received in both urban and college markets.","We continue to think we've got significant opportunities in localization and the work we done in Chicago and now Los Angeles just continues to confirm that. So, our strategy continues to perform well. John and his team continue to enhance our store and supply chain capabilities to continue to meet the needs of our guest. So, as we sit here today there is no significant change in our strategy, but tactically we recognized the consumer environment is tougher.","We've got to make sure we're delivering the right value. We're winning with both the stock-up and the fill-in-trip. We're making sure that we have the right experience for our guest whether they're shopping in-store and online. And we don't see any structural change in the consumer environment. We think this is a short term bump in the road, but we think we're well-positioned and everything we see from a GDP and consumer confidence standpoint gives us the confidence that this is going to be a short term impact and we're going to see very solid results in both the third and fourth quarter and keep us on our long term guidance track.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I just wanted to clarify the resets in the dry grocery, when did that take place? Was that during the quarter or was that after the quarter closed and if it was during April, what was drag? Do you guys know?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Scott, it took place right after Easter during the month of April. So, a major effort inside of our stores, we touch as mentioned earlier, all of those center store grocery aisles. We added a number of new items over 1000. We brought new brands into those categories. We've expanded our simply balance line. So, all that took place and it was very disruptive and we plan for it in April.","We now have the work behind us. And I'm very excited about the feedback we're receiving and the responses we're seeing in many of these categories and certainly expect that we'll see those businesses accelerate, now that we have more relevant assortment and we've significantly increase the representation of organic and natural and gluten free and local items in those aisles.","Scott Mushkin","So, Brian, the weakness you continue to see into May is, I think you say that reset went very well, and that's a chunk of sales. So the weakness you see continuing into May would be non-consumable areas that are just as you say areas that have heavy inventory in some of the Signature categories. Is that a good way to frame it?","Brian Cornell","Yes. I think that's largely the case. Scott, again as I said earlier and I want to make we're really transparent about this with examples. We've see very slow sales performance in the Northeast. And we have a same presentation. We have the same ads. We have the same value. We have the same great in-store experience, but on the day and day basis we're getting very different outcomes. So, on one hand it gives me confidence to say, what we're doing is working, yes, that's working in many parts of the country, but we have isolated geographies where whether a late spring, whether it\u2019s a change in short term consumer behavior, we are not seeing the same results, but we are delivering the same great content. So, I expect the Northeast to recover, I think spring will arrive there and I think when the guest is out shopping they will continue to choose Target and we\u2019ll continue to provide them a great in store and online experience. But we are seeing very significant geographic volatility. Unlike anything I\u2019d seen in many, many years.","Scott Mushkin","Interesting. And then I just wanted to touch on the filling trip situation and I think you talked about promoting a little bit more to try to get those trips, is that promotion different? Is that promotion more in the consumable side of things, as you look at it, it seems intuitively that would be, but just want to kind of get your thoughts?","Brian Cornell","Scott, you\u2019re spot on. It\u2019s much more about consumables, household essentials and to be very clear, it\u2019s probably less about promotional intensity, but ensuring that we are promoting and presenting the right items particularly at the back end of the month when the consumer and our guest is more likely to look for single unit items, more items at a value. So we\u2019re going to make sure we are making the tactical adjustments to what we advertise, what we present in-store and making sure that we\u2019re winning both with the stock up guests but also with the guests that\u2019s looking for value and looking for smaller, single unit packs at the right value.","Scott Mushkin","So then I had just one last one I want to sneak in, because I was in your store Long Beach which I thought was wonderful that small target.","Brian Cornell","It\u2019s a fabulous store.","Scott Mushkin","How close are you from test to actually maybe rolling out more of those and then our yield, thank you.","Brian Cornell","So I\u2019m smiling and I may turn this over to John, but we have all actually visited our Bixby store in Long Beach over the last few weeks. The store really captures the best of Target in a smaller, 30,000 square foot environment, and very positive reaction from the guest. So as we think about future flex formats, that is a model that we are excited about, a model that certainly seems to be connecting with the guest and you should expect to see more of those as we go forward, but I mean I\u2019ll hand it over to John whose been intimately involved in the roll out of flex formats and specifically the work we are doing in Long Beach.","John Hulbert","Yes I was just obviously we are very excited about the performance of the stores, I think the financial performance certainly but I think Brian mentioned really it\u2019s the guest reception of those stores and while they are very conveniently placed like the Bixby stores they are not convenient stores. The intent is to lead forward with what Target does well, home apparel are signature categories and that\u2019s what you really see in that Bixby store.","So we will continue to increase the number we are doing as we go forward, but continue to test geographies and sizes of stores and how those two work together. Obviously the Bixby store is quite large and that\u2019s a little bit different neighborhood than we have done in the past. And so the Tribeca store that Brian referenced, again, very different. Very dense urban store, two level store. So we continue to test kind of configuration and neighborhood but feel very, very good about what we found so far and you will see us continue to grow those numbers of stores that we opened over the next several years.","Brian Cornell","Just to finish up on that. I think the Long Beach store that you visited is a great example, that really shows how we are approaching each of these initiatives. We are testing, we are learning, we are refining, the team are getting better and better at layout and assortment. And you have seen that when you walk the Long Beach location. And the feedback that we have received from the guest is even in a smaller box it feels like Target, and it feels like the best of Target. The work that the team's done in the center of that store to merchandize our soft lines is really outstanding. We're getting great feedback around our food presentation in that store. We've got the right home assortment.","So we're tailoring that for the local markets. But it's an example of the fact that we've been disciplined. We're not sprinting. We're making sure that we're really thoughtful. We're learning. We're adjusting. And you're seeing each of the new flex formats get better and better in layout, assortment and tailoring to meet the local market. So we are very excited about it and we'll continue to take that learning and build it in the new flex formats that we'll be opening over the balance of this year and the next year. ","Scott Mushkin","Thanks guys.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question is from John Zolidis from Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about the second half of the year, you've already address it a little bit and you provided us a lot of evidence, I think that points towards weather as a significant culprit in the volatility in the sales at the end of the first quarter, the start of the second quarter. But you also eluded at some points that maybe there are something else going on with the consumer.","So I was wondering if you could just talk about what else might be negatively impacting the consumer for your consumer that you're aware of. Do you have any data for example if you look by segment of consumer income levels or REDcard usage that would help you understand the trends to greater extend? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","John as you might imagine, we're spending a lot of time and have spend a lot of time as a team looking at performance through a number of different vantage points both internally but also certainly incorporating external data. Now certainly it was earlier Easter. We recognize the impact of that. Certainly weather in many major markets has been a factor. It's not an excuse. We've got to figure out how we perform under any circumstances.","We know as the guest and our consumer has moved through the course of 2016, prices of the pump, fuel prices have resin and that certainly an impact. And then when we look at macro basis on overall spending, we certainly recognize that consumers are spending more on travel, on leisure activities, they been investing in their homes as I mentioned before. But there is no structural change that gives us pause and has us changing our strategy, altering our outlook for the full year.","We think we're continuing to improve our digital capabilities. I think our store experience is improving each and every week. The response we're getting from the guest based on changes we've made in apparel and home and recently in food are very encouraging. As John mentioned our flex formats performing quite well. So, we feel confident that the content we have in place, the plans we have for the second half of the year, some of the enhancements we've made from our branding in in-store and online standpoint are going to continue to deliver solid results.","So, we see this as a momentary speed bump, but we see no reason to alter our strategy. These are tactical adjustments we have to make. And market by market we want to make sure we're well-positioned to compete going forward.","John Zolidis","Thanks very much. Good luck.","Cathy Smith","Thank you.","Brian Cornell","We've had time for one more question operator.","Operator","Your last question comes from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers","Made it in. Thank you. So, following up on that question and then just a thread of questions, so, outside of the Northeast and California hasn't been more consistent. And then, relating to that, as you think about the second quarter guidance, are you basically extrapolating current trends which have been weather impacted or are you taking a directional view either more conservatively expecting to pick up as a quarter progresses or in either direction? Thanks.","Cathy Smith","Yes. So, we obviously have insight into where May is at today. And then, we've got Memorial Day coming. We've got great plans around leading into Memorial Day and have every confidence we're going to have guest come to Target, whether in or further online and then we-- summer and warmer weather will come and so we have an expectation that the trend we see today doesn\u2019t change overnight but it does improve throughout the quarter because we got some really great plans to deliver for our guests.","And then also in the latter part of this quarter we have Cat & Jack launching and we are very excited about Cat & Jack launching before back-to-school season and we expect that to be a leading Target only brand that will be a $1 billion brand in time.","Brian Cornell","So Chris thanks to your question and I really appreciate everyone who called in today. We are trying to make sure we allotted significant time for your questions. We\u2019ve had a chance to answer your questions, address some of your concerns. So that will conclude our quarter. I appreciate your time today, and thank you for dialing in.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, November 20, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Hulbert","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.","In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on our third quarter performance, outlook for the fourth quarter and progress on our long-term strategic initiatives. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.","This morning, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.","And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year and beyond. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are the result of superb execution by our team as they continue to drive outstanding near-term performance. In addition, the team is fully engaged in making meaningful progress as they work to transform Target and position us for sustainable long-term success.","Third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.09 was in line with our expectations and more than 20% higher than last year. This performance also established a new all-time high for Target\u2019s third quarter adjusted EPS. Our third quarter comparable sales increase of 5.1% was also in line with our expectations and slightly stronger than the pace we established in the first half of the year. This comp growth is very encouraging on its own, but we're even more excited that it's being driven by traffic in both our stores and digital channels.","Comparable sales in our digital channels grew 49% in the third quarter, far outpacing the industry and the vast majority of our peers. This growth was driven by our guest response to our team\u2019s efforts to make the digital shopping experience easy and seamless, deliver new and innovative items through our owned, exclusive and national brand assortments and offer an unmatched suite of convenient fulfillment options.","While digital channel sales continued to grow rapidly, we are benefiting from healthy traffic and sales growth in our stores as well. This growth reflects the capital we are investing in our remodel program, enhancements of the assortment and presentation in key categories, and investments in our team, which will help them provide an elevated experience and higher level of service.","And finally, on top of comparable sales, new stores contributed more than 0.5 percentage point to our third quarter sales growth. This growth is being driven by new small format locations that we're opening in dense urban settings and near college campuses across the country. We refer to these stores as small because of their square footage, but they really punched above their weight because of their high sales productivity. This allows these locations to deliver strong financial returns while allowing Target to reach guest segments we couldn't serve in the past.","As we've been saying all year, when we analyze the drivers of our strong traffic and sales growth, we see the benefit of all the strategic initiatives we are pursuing, including our remodel program, efforts to rejuvenate our portfolio of owned and exclusive brands, the rollout of new fulfillment options focused on delivering ease and convenience, including Restock, Drive-Up, and Personal Shopping in as little as two hours with Shipt; investments that allow our stores to fulfill an increasing number of target.com shipments, allowing us to deliver quickly, while also controlling costs; new digital capabilities to make shopping faster, easier, and more inspiring; our work to ensure we are priced right daily while delivering the appropriate number of clear, compelling promotions; and investments in hours, wages and training for our team to further differentiate the shopping experience in our stores. Rather than measuring a separate benefit from each of these efforts, we believe the impact of all of them together is well beyond the sum of the parts.","From a guest perspective, it's the combination of everything we are doing that makes Target more top of mind, causing guests to choose us more often. Beyond the impact of our efforts, we continue to benefit from a very healthy consumer and macroeconomic backdrop.","In addition, as other retailers continue to close stores and liquidate in the face of rapid changes in consumer preferences and shopping behaviors, our investment position Target to capture sales and market share by serving consumers who are no longer shopping those competitors.","Now, we've been clear that all of our efforts to grow and transform Target involve a commitment of resources, which explains why I've already used the word \u201cinvestment\u201d five times in these remarks. And it's also why we are fortunate to have sound operations, healthy cash flows, and a balance sheet, which provides the necessary flexibility to invest in our future.","In addition, we continue to pursue initiatives, which will help us offset incremental costs, including tools and technologies that deliver higher labor efficiency in our stores, allowing us to focus more of our team\u2019s number of hours in service of our guests. Cost disciplines beginning at headquarters that's spanning all of our operations based on relentless prioritization and a focus on what's most important.","Our brand development work, which helps us deliver continued strong performance in our highest margin, home, and apparel categories, and the development, testing, and rollout of automation in our supply chain, which will take work out of our store backrooms, and move the bulk of replenishment activity upstream into our distribution centers. While we are already benefiting from these efforts today, we see much more potential over time.","Most notably, our work to optimize and automate inventory replenishment is in the very early stages and we expect to realize the vast majority of potential savings from these efforts over the next few years. But even today because of the depth of our resources, our business is thriving even as we transform our business.","As we've said previously, we believe that this year will establish a sustainable benchmark for our operating margin rate over the longer term as we achieve a balancing point between the rate pressures and opportunities of operating an omnichannel retail business.","In addition, we continue to generate a robust amount of cash, which allows us to fund our current elevated level of CapEx, an attractive dividend, which we will continue to grow every year, and the return of additional cash through share repurchase all while maintaining our debt rating.","So while we are not providing 2019 financial guidance on the call today, I will say that we are optimistic about our ability to deliver profitable growth next year and beyond. We've annualized the meaningful investments in operating income we made throughout 2017 and we are poised to benefit from far greater scale across all of our initiatives, including new small formats, hundreds of additional remodels, the continually expanding reach of our new fulfillment options and a comprehensive change in the way we replenish our store inventory.","But today, as the team will describe in more detail, our teams are focused and ready to deliver an outstanding holiday season in terms of both sales and profitability. Our stores are staffed and the team members are trained. They are equipped with new tools and capabilities to support an unmatched suite of fulfillment options, and we are operating an outstanding assortment of owned, exclusive and national brand items.","And to support these plans, we will deliver a compelling drumbeat of marketing and holiday promotions designed to keep Target top of mind with our guests throughout the holiday season. While continuing to focus on delivering consistent value by ensuring we are priced right daily.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John, who will provide an update on our rollout of new fulfillment options, investments in new and existing stores and plans to deliver outstanding service for our guests for this holiday season. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks Brian, and good morning, everybody. As we've said many times, we are in the process of making meaningful changes to Target\u2019s business and operating model and that effort is far from complete. But last year, when we had just announced this plan at our Investor meeting, we often spoke about how eager we were to move beyond the planning stage and get to the execution phase. That way all of us could see what was working, what needed to change, and what we could accomplish faster.","Today, we have clearly reached the execution phase and there are many data points that show we are making great progress, but there is no better metric than traffic, which has been growing in the last couple of quarters faster than I have seen in my time at Target.","As Brian said, there is no way to fully isolate the benefit of everything we\u2019re doing separately. But the one initiative that we can best measure in isolation is our remodel program. Since we can compare newly remodeled stores to a set of control stores, both before and after the remodel is completed.","When we perform that analysis, we continue to measure incremental comp sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. Consistent with our goals, when we launched the remodel program, and given that we completed more than 300 remodels this year, the benefit of that kind of lift in that many stores is one of the many reasons we are optimistic about the upcoming fourth quarter.","A piece of unexpected good news is that we have seen a measurable incremental lift in the second year of the remodels we completed more than a year-ago. This benefit was not assumed in our planning for these projects and represents another reason for our optimism about the next couple of years, when we expect to complete another 600 remodels or more.","On the fulfillment side, the progress we have made this year is truly amazing. At this time a year-ago, we're in the early stages of testing Drive-Up in about 50 stores here in the Twin Cities. Today, we offer this service to nearly 1,000 stores and the ability of our team to deliver consistently outstanding service while scaling up at that pace is remarkable.","Drive-Up continues to receive the highest Net Promoter Score of any service we provide. We measure it every month and has been consistently in the mid-80s to low-90s. Early analysis show that a meaningful portion of our Drive-Up orders or either incremental or taking the place of demand that would otherwise have been Shipt to guests homes. Obviously, given the cost of last mile shipping, we like the economics of Drive-Up much better and our guests are clearly happy as well.","Shipt has rolled out even more rapidly than Drive-Up. After all, we purchased the company less than a year-ago and today it is operating in more than 250 markets, making an accessible to nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population. As of today, Shipt shoppers are fulfilling guests\u2019 orders for more than 1,400 Target stores, and a meaningful number of those orders are delivered in less than two hours.","While our ship-from-store capability was rolled out several years ago, it also continues to grow rapidly. For the third quarter, in which overall comparable digital sales grew an impressive 49%. Our ship-from-store volume more than doubled, while other shipment modes were nearly flat. As we have said many times, the ability to ship from a nearby store is a win-win.","Compared with shipping from farther away, shipping from store provides speed for our guests, while dramatically reducing the average cost per shipment. But while Drive-Up, Shipt, and ship-from-store are our newest capabilities, it's important to remember that we offer our guests several additional options. In-store pickup continues to grow rapidly and it reliably accounts for about 15% of our digital volume. We're also seeing strong growth in Restock, our next-day delivery service of household essentials.","And finally, let's not forget the conventional in-store shopping, which still accounts for the vast majority of our volume, continues to grow and delivers high levels of guest satisfaction.","Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to talk about a couple of ways our team has been preparing for the upcoming holiday season. First on inventory, as you saw in our released this morning, our inventory position was up about 18% compared with last year.","Consistent with our discussion on this call three months ago, this end of quarter increase is being driven by a few distinct factors that I want to highlight. First, and obviously, we are buying into the strong sales growth we've been seeing and expect to see in the fourth quarter.","Second, from a timing perspective this year, we'll have the maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas that can occur on the calendar. As a result, our peak inventory position is happening relatively early this year, causing more of it to be reflected on the third quarter balance sheet.","And finally, as you know, the Toy category sees a bigger than average holiday season peak relative to most other categories. So you're also seeing our investment to support that sales peak in Toys. Altogether, we are comfortable with our inventory position and we feel well prepared to support strong performance in the upcoming holiday season.","Lastly, I want to talk about our seasonal hiring in our stores readiness for the holidays. I'm happy to announce that despite very tight labor market conditions across the country, we have achieved our goal to hire 120,000 seasonal team members, which is up from a goal of 100,000 a year-ago.","Now that we have these new team members on Board and ready to help us for the holidays, we are providing them with improved training tools and processes, allowing them to be trained and productive in about half the average time compared with a year ago.","So as I turn the call over to Mark, I want to give a shout out to the team. We've asked a lot of them this last year and I am so grateful for the way they have delivered because of their hard work, our stores are looking and operating better. We have new convenient fulfillment options available in our stores, coast-to-coast.","We are operating hundreds of new and remodeled stores, which are guests love. And we have a supply chain that's supporting everything from behind the scenes. I'm sure the team feels like they've already done a year's worth of work in the first three quarters of the year, but I also see every day that they are energized and ready for what's coming in the next few weeks. We say it a lot because we know it's true. Target has the best team in retail.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mark, for his recap of our third quarter performance and our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday. Mark?","Mark Tritton","Thanks John. As I mentioned in our last quarterly call, on the merchandising team, we continually focus on maintaining a sense of balance in our approach between value and inspiration, satisfying wants and needs between unique owned brands and quality national brands, and offering compelling deals while being priced right daily. Our third quarter performance reinforces our confidence that we are successfully maintaining that sense of balance.","From a category perspective, we are really pleased with the third quarter performance of our highest-margin Home and Apparel categories as both categories saw comp growth just below the company average. In Apparel, we saw particular strength in Baby as well as Jewelry and Accessories and Men's. Growth in Home was led by outstanding comps in our home decor assortment. Hardlines saw even stronger performance, comping in the high single-digits this quarter. This was led by Toys, which saw comp growth of more than 20%.","As you know, we've invested in the Toy category this year given the recent closures of Toys \"R\" Us stores around the country. So far this year, our Toy results have exceeded their expectations in terms of sales and share. Beyond results in our most discretionary categories, we are also really pleased with growth rates in our less discretionary Essentials and Beauty and Food and Beverage areas.","We saw particular outstanding performance in Essentials and Beauty, which grew faster than the company average. Within this category, we saw double-digit growth in Baby, which again is also benefiting from the closures of Toys \"R\" Us and Babies \"R\" Us towards in the U.S.","In addition, we introduced three new innovative owned and exclusive brands in the quarter: Quip and Native in Personal Care; and our new Essentials-owned brand smartly, which is designed for the younger budget-conscious guest who lives in smaller spaces. In Food and Beverage, comp sales grew about 4% in the third quarter, consistent with our second quarter performance.","Within the category, we saw strong encouraging results in our owned brand assortment, along with double-digit comps again in adult beverage. While it's important to focus on our absolute growth rates, our team also maintains a disciplined focus on market share metrics, which indicate Target\u2019s relevance against our competitive set. On these measures, we saw another quarter of consistent strong performance.","Third quarter data showed we continue to gain meaningful share across every one of our core merchandising categories and nearly all of the subcategories beneath them. This reinforces what we have been saying for some time. The traffic is a key measure for us because whenever we gain a new trip from our guest, they tend to shop multiple categories, lifting performance across the board.","It's also important to maintain a balance between share gains in our most discretionary and less discretionary categories. That's because while we always want to shine brightest during key seasonal moments like Back-to-School, Back-to-College and Halloween, it's the Essentials, Beauty and Food and Beverage categories that sustain our traffic and sales between the biggest seasonal events.","Importantly, in the third quarter, with all of our categories during their parts to deliver traffic, we successfully comped over several prominent owned brand launches in the third quarter of last year. But now let's look ahead because even though we are really pleased with our performance so far this year, I want to share while we are even more excited about our fourth quarter and holiday seasonal plans. After all, while Target is a guest destination during holiday periods year round, we're entering by far the biggest holiday season of the year.","As always, we are ready to deliver inspiration, convenience and unbelievable deals to our guests this season. And we'll support it all without holiday ad campaign, and this year's theme, Gather Round, which celebrates all the ways we choose to spend time with family and friends during the season and make it easy to do so. And obviously what Toys is important all year long, it rises to a whole new level in the holidays as we typically see half of our annual toy sales in the fourth quarter.","This year given the opportunity I outlined earlier, we've really upped our game. In 500 stores, we've added more space for toys and in more than 100 locations; we\u2019ve completely remodeled that section of the store. Across all of our stores, we've set up new displays and deepened our inventory, adding more than 2,500 new and exclusive toys for the season, doubling the newness we introduced a year-ago.","In addition, we've planned for 25,000 hours of family, friendly events in our stores and we've gone all out with this year's kids gifting catalog at nearly 90 pages, kids of all ages will be able to find at least one must have gift and likely many more.","This year to make the process even easier, we've added digital capabilities that simplifies shopping the catalog. Using our Target app, you can simply scan any of the pages in the catalog and instantly add any of the items from the page into your shopping cart or wish list easy.","Beyond Toys, we\u2019re featuring more than 30 curated grab-and-go gifting displays in our store this season. These displays featured more than 1,400 mostly exclusive items, most at prices under $15, ranging from pops of color in cold weather accessories to everything you need to create a cozy winter escape.","We also have featured this assortment on our gifting hub on target.com, which features interactive menus to make it very easy to find the perfect gift for everyone on your list. And again, based on last year's success, we're bringing back our seasonal Wondershop again this year. This winter wonderland features unique items to trim the tree, lux gift wrapping supplies and sweet indulgences in food.","In select stores this year, our Wondershop includes a personalized gifting station offering guests the opportunity to create a truly unique gift for under $20 by custom printing a recipient's name or initials on any item in a unique assortment of stockings, ornaments, and gift sets. Of course, throughout the season, our guests will find more than 20 new owned and exclusive brands that we've launched over the last two years.","This will be the first holiday season in which we featured our new Umbro, Universal Thread, Prologue, Wild Fable and Original Use brands in apparel, our Opalhouse and Made By Design brands in home as well as Heyday in electronics. So it's clear we have a lot more in-store for the holidays. But guests are focused on more than the assortment at this time of year, everyone loves the deal and we are more than ready to earn some of that love.","After all, Black Friday is only a few days away and we've got a killer lineup of must-have items and prices. But a key part of feeling good about a deal is also enjoying the experience. That's why we're focused on providing ease as well as excitement for our guests this Black Friday. Once again this year, we are giving our REDcard holders early access to many of our Black Friday deals and target.com guests will be able to shop out Black Friday deals on Thanksgiving morning.","Beyond having items just shipped to their homes, online guests have the option to order items for pickup and drive up as well. And of course, this holiday season will be the first one featuring free two-day shipping with no minimum order and personal shopping with Shipt; in our stores, which opened at 5:00 PM on Thanksgiving Day will position team members in the busiest areas of the stores equipped without Skip-the-Line technology to allow guests to pay for their items anywhere on the sales floor.","We've been testing this capability since earlier in the year and we have rolled it out across the chain in time for the holiday season. But Black Friday is just the beginning. We'll be offering great deals throughout the season, including our popular weekend deals and Cartwheel Daily deals.","But let's not forget Cyber Week. Once again on Cyber Monday, we will offer 15% of the majority of our assortment, will follow that blockbuster offer with great deals a week including daily offers on apparel, home items, personal care, beauty and electronics.","And finally, as if the arrival of the package from Target isn't enough, we've recently rolled out new shipping boxes on target.com. These boxes are unmistakably Target and feature our iconic Bullseye Mascot. This is just one small way we are focused on making the everyday special for our guests throughout the holiday season and beyond.","So I want to thank the team for everything they've done to prepare for this moment. To say it takes the ability to pull off the holiday season is an understatement, it requires cost coordination alignment across all of that teams, including merchandising, marketing, stores, supply chain, technology. That's just the beginning of the list. But its work we loved during our favorite time of year, a time when everything comes together in service of our guests and now we feel ready and can't wait to see how we delivered the holiday season.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who will provide more detail on our third quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?","Catherine Smith","Thanks Mark. Our third quarter performance was right down the middle when compared to our expectations on both the topline and the bottom line, and of course when you look at our growth compared with last year, you can see that our team continues to deliver really outstanding performance.","Third quarter comparable sales grew 5.1% just above the 4.8% pace we established in the first half of the year. From a channel perspective, comparable sales grew more than 3% in our stores and 49% in our digital channels. This is the strongest digital comp we\u2019ve ever reported and it demonstrates the positive impact of everything we're doing to deliver convenience, speed and reliability regardless of how our guests choose to shop.","From a traffic and basket perspective, third quarter comp growth was driven by a traffic increase of 5.3%, offset by a very small decline in average ticket. As we've described in prior quarters, both of these metrics reflect and increasing penetration of smaller, quick and fill-in trip, which are growing much faster at Target than for the industry overall. This trend reflects the guest response to our work over the last couple of years to enhance convenience and ensure we are priced right everyday, which is reinforced by our Target Run and Done marketing campaign.","Beyond comparable sales, our total sales growth of 5.7% reflects a new store contribution of about 60 basis points. As Brian mentioned, these stores deliver very high sales productivity, which allows them to make a meaningful contribution to our growth even as overall square footage is down slightly compared with last year.","Our third quarter gross margin rate of 28.7% was lower than our expectations. This was the result of higher than expected supply chain costs driven by digital fulfillment and the cost of receiving and processing a larger holiday inventory position compared with a year-ago.","Our third quarter SG&A expense rate was about flat to last year. This reflects continued investments we're making in our team, specifically hours training and wages, which allow our teams to provide new and enhanced experiences in our stores. These investments are being offset by continued cost discipline across the enterprise as we continually work to increase efficiency and eliminate lower priority and non-value added work.","Our depreciation and amortization expense rate was down about 40 basis points from last year, reflecting lower D&A dollars combined with the benefit of 5.6% total revenue growth. Below the operating income line, third quarter interest expense of $115 million was $136 million lower than last year. This decline was driven primarily by early debt retirement costs, which we recognized in last year's third quarter.","In addition, it reflects a lower ongoing run rate for interest expense this year, driven by last year's debt refinancing and retirement activity. And of course our effective income tax rate was lower this year, reflecting the ongoing benefit of last year's federal tax reform along with the benefit of some discrete items. Altogether, this performance led to GAAP EPS of $1.16, up more than 33% compared with last year and adjusted EPS of $1.09, up more than 20% from last year.","Turning to the balance sheet, our inventory at the end of the third quarter was nearly $1.9 billion higher than a year-ago, driven by two factors, John highlighted earlier. However, accounts payable, were nearly $2 billion higher than a year-ago, meaning this entire increase in inventories has been funded by growth in payables.","Payables leverage has been a positive story for more than a year now, providing a beneficial tailwind as we invest to transform our business. Beyond investments in inventory, we continue to have ample capacity to fund robust capital investment and return cash to our shareholders.","In the third quarter alone, our CapEx was just over $1 billion, we returned more than $300 million in the form of dividends and more than $500 million through share repurchase, all within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.","And lastly, our after-tax return on invested capital was 15.8% for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, up from 13.4% a year-ago. As a reminder, this year's ROIC calculation reflects the discreet benefit of last year's federal tax reform relating to the reevaluation of our deferred tax liabilities.","Excluding this discrete benefit, after-tax ROIC was 13.9% over the last 12 months. This is about 50 basis points higher than a year-ago and demonstrates the impact of all of our initiatives combined with a benefit of a lower ongoing tax rate resulting from the passage of federal tax reform.","Now let's turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter and the implications for our full-year financial results. On the comparable sales line, we are expecting fourth quarter growth of around 5% consistent with what we have delivered year-to-date.","On the operating income line, we are looking for a small rate decline compared with last year. This outlook reflects continued rate pressure on the gross margin line although not to the same degree as we saw in third quarter.","Regarding SG&A and G&A expense rate, we are expecting relative stability compared with last year. This performance supports an expected range for full-year adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.50 and a GAAP EPS range of $5.41 to $5.61. The expected range for this year's adjusted EPS represents 13% growth at the lower end and 17% at the higher end. And of course, this range is ahead of our expectations going into the year.","As we've seen better-than-expected traffic and sales so far this year, our business has delivered better-than-expected bottom line performance even as we continue to make meaningful investments in our transformation.","Before I turn it back to Brian, I want to cover one housekeeping item. Consistent with last year, we plan to issue an update on our financial performance following the holiday season. This year, we have schedule that update for Thursday, January 10, and we look forward to speaking many of the after that announcement.","And finally, I want to thank you for your time today and your continued engagement in our story. This is an incredibly dynamic time to be in the retail business. As we look across the landscape, it's becoming clear that those of us who have the resources to invest and the ability to adapt quickly are seeing the benefit in our traffic sales and financial performance. For us, it's a vivid reminder of the benefit of maintaining a strong balance sheet and sound operation while also maintaining a relentless focus on our guests and their expectations.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for some final remarks. Brian?","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Cathy. Before we move to your questions, I want to start by letting you know that we plan to host our 2019 Financial Community Meeting in New York City on Tuesday, March 5. Our Investor Relations team will send out more detailed information in January, but we want you to have a date as you plan for next year.","So now before we get to your questions, I want to step back and recap our journey, since the Target 2017 Financial Community Meeting. At that meeting, we talked about the need to invest both capital and operating margin to transform our business and position Target as a relevant and successful retailer for decades not months or quarters. We did so with the confidence that we're taking the right long-term steps for our business. And we had the conviction that over time, our shareholders would look back and appreciate our long-term perspective.","So today, as we're entering the fourth quarter of only our second year in this effort, I hope you're already happy with what you're seeing. Based on what we delivered in this year, combined with our fourth quarter expectation, we are positioned to deliver our best comparable sales growth and more than a decade and establish a new high for Target's earnings per share.","It's great to be in that position in only the second year of this effort, but there's a lot more to do. After all, when we embarked on this effort, we described 2018 as the transition year. As we get ready to move into 2019, we're ready to accelerate and scale beyond that transition period.","Next year, we'll be positioned to complete our rollout of Drive-Up and Shipt, remodel and build more exciting stores, and make meaningful progress in our work to modernize our supply chain and radically change the way we replenish our stores. While the supply chain effort will take place behind the scenes, they can deliver a host of important outcomes, enhancing our liability and reducing costs.","Importantly, this effort will free up labor in our stores, providing more time for our team members to serve guests on the sales floor and support all of our different options for digital fulfillment as we continue to drive profitable growth and build even greater loyalty with our guest. So thank you for your time today.","And now we'll move on to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Seth Sigman","Thanks a lot, and good morning, guys. So if we just focus on the quarter, your sales and EPS came in at about the midpoint, but your EBIT margin was below guidance. Seems like it was mostly gross margin, but just hoping that you can elaborate on what was different versus your expectations. And then as you think about the EBIT margin implied for the fourth quarter, I think you said down slightly, Cathy, so it seems to be down a lot less than the third quarter, maybe even up at the high-end of the range for the year. So just curious, what is different in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Why don't I start now, and then I'll turn it over to Cathy. I think as we look at our absolute performance in the third quarter, we were right on our expectations. We continued to have another very strong quarter where traffic grew over 5%. We had very strong overall comp performance of 5.1%, an acceleration versus the first half of the year. We delivered digital growth of 49%, our strongest growth rate ever. And we did grow EPS by over 20%, while growing market share in every one of our major categories.","So if I look at our performance in the quarter, we're executing versus the plan we laid out in the beginning of the year. We're seeing a very strong response to our store remodels. Our new small formats are performing very well in each and every market. We continue to drive very strong performance with our new owned brands, and the investments we're making in our team are driving exceptional responses from the guests. So as we look at our performance in the quarter, we're right where we expected to be and we're set up well for a very strong holiday season. Cathy?","Catherine Smith","Yes. So Seth, as we said, we expect a small rate decline in the fourth quarter. First off, we expect a 5% comp, so we can start there, and then a small rate decline in the quarter. And as you said, we pointed to \u2013 we do expect continued pressure in gross margin, but not to the same extent we saw in Q3. The biggest difference is our \u2013 while we still expect great sales, we obviously already anticipate the mix that we'll be seeing in that business, just like we did last year's fourth quarter.","And we'll see strong digital sales \u2013 but we would've seen strong digital sales last year's fourth quarter, so the year-over-year changes are a little less as you can imagine. And then lastly, we're moving \u2013 we moved a lot \u2013 we received a lot and moved a lot of inventory in the third quarter in anticipation of the fourth quarter, and so we would expect those costs to not be as strong. ","Seth Sigman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. And then just, Brian, you highlighted a number of positives particularly on the sales line. And there are clearly cost to achieve that, right, and drive that higher share that you're seeing. So can you just help us better understand some of the initiatives to help offset those cost pressures that you alluded to earlier? I'm not sure if those are already in play, if they're already happening, but just help us better understand when that can have a more meaningful impact and support that profitable earnings growth that you were talking about earlier? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","As I mentioned in my earlier comments, obviously we're in the very early stages of the transformation of our supply chain or replenishment systems, very early stages of testing automation and improving overall processes. Those will take place over time. We've also rolled out a number of new fulfillment options. And while we know that throughout the year, Ship to Home is very important to our guests, as we continue to build awareness around other fulfillment options, order online pickup in-store, our new Drive-Up capabilities in almost 1,000 locations, our Restock program, as well as our membership program through Shipt. Those are going to be very important components that help to shape margins over time.","So we're in the very, very early stages, both from a supply chain standpoint, the transformation of store replenishment, but also in building awareness of the full suite of fulfillment options that we now have at Target, so those are going to take place over the next few years. We've been very consistent in saying we're in the very early stages. But those benefits are in front of us, and we expect to see those impact our business in a profitable way over the next two to three years.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thank you and good luck.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. You may go ahead.","Matthew McClintock","Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Brian Cornell","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew McClintock","Brian, you talked about a lot of these fulfillment initiatives and you specifically highlighted a lot of strength with Shipt and Drive-Up. And I was wondering, could you maybe give us a sense because you did say that Drive-Up is incremental. Can you give us a sense of how often these consumers are actually choosing to use Drive-Up or Shipt? And can you give us a sense of how many of these people are new customers or are the existing customers? Are you getting people who normally make 12 trips to Target a year doing a 13th or 14th? Or are they doing more like 16th or 17th trip, four extra trips because they're now using Shipt? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","Matt, it's something that we're looking at as we sit here today, but we're in the very early stages. Again, it was only 12 months ago we had Drive-Up in 50 locations. We've been rolling that out across the country over the course of this year. We've rapidly expanded Shipt to over 200 markets, but we're still in the very early stages.","So we're still building awareness. We literally just started our advertising campaign to talk to our guests, to talk to the consumer about this new suite of fulfillment options, so those are the metrics we'll be looking at over time, and they will continue to contribute to our digital growth. But it's still very, very early, and we expect to build awareness during the holiday season and throughout 2019.","Catherine Smith","Matt, I'll pile on a little bit. John shared in the prepared remarks too, while we're seeing two really positive things out of that effort out of Drive-Up and Shipt, specifically though in Drive-Up, and that is we're seeing incremental guest making incremental trips, to your question, and we'll continue to measure that.","But secondly, is, we're seeing them [shift] what would have been a two-day free delivery into coming by our stores because they're so well located. And we can make them pull right into our parking lot and bring it to their car in less than two minutes. And so both of those are really good back patterns as we think about the further economics longer term.","Brian Cornell","But Matt, we'll be in a much better position 12 months from now to really understand how it's shaping guest behavior, the incrementality. How it drives additional trips, we're still in the very early stages. But as Cathy just referenced, the early indicators are quite positive.","Matthew McClintock","Perfect. If I get a one quick follow-up, just on SG&A clearly, you're still making a lot of investments, but you're starting to lap a lot of investments on acceleration of investment that you're making. I'm talking specific to wages. As we see comp store sales remain in pretty strong territory, especially given your very strong traffic, is it possible that as we get into early 2019 that we could start to see a little bit more of leverage from some of the strength in comps if it stays?","Catherine Smith","Yes. So as you said, we're continuing to invest. We think having the best team in Retail is really important, so we'll keep making those investments on our path to $15 by 2020 as we said. But what you saw with us being essentially flat this quarter is that we are starting to find some of those offsets. And to your point, we'll continue. We think a lot of those benefits of removing replenishment out of the basket of our stores and back upstream and automating them, will help to continue to offset some of those costs.","Brian Cornell","But Matt, those investments we've been making on our team are clearly one of the big drivers behind the comp store increases we're seeing in our stores, the traffic we're seeing both from a store and a digital standpoint. The team members, first and foremost, are great ambassadors of our brand. They're helping us drive this performance and certainly contribute in the market share gains we're seeing across all of our categories.","Matthew McClintock","Thank you very much. I really appreciate the color.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.","Edward Kelly","Yes, hi. Good morning, guys. Could we just start with the gross margin? Could you just provide a bit more color on the gross margin performance this quarter? Cathy, you did mention that it was a bit disappointing. What would be the impact of digital fulfillment, mix, how much of an impact was the growth in inventory? And just any color there I think would be helpful.","Catherine Smith","Yes. So as we said, it was a little lower than we had anticipated, really driven by two things; the supply chain costs that we're seeing because digital came in at 49% growth, which was higher than we had anticipated, so therefore, we're going to see a little bit more pressure there.","And then just the expense related to the timing, the size and timing of the inventory receipt because we have the earliest Black Friday and Thanksgiving that the calendar will allow, and so that caused us to be moving a lot of inventory in third quarter, which obviously showed up in our inventories sitting in our balance sheet as well.","And so the cost, the gross margin pressures were really split between those two. We are partially offsetting them as we said we would with some of our merchant initiatives, so thinking about those cost of goods sold savings that we've been working on all your that are actually pretty meaningful. So we are seeing some offsets just not obviously to the extent we needed.","Edward Kelly","Okay. And then Brian, just a question for you, and as you think about 2019, and obviously it's early, but you sound positive about the opportunity to deliver profitable growth. Are you implying stable EBIT margins with this? And can you talk a bit more just about how you're thinking about balancing investment in the business with that goal? If you think about 2018, it was a bit harder to deliver EBIT growth despite what was very good comp growth. So what changes next year?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Well, Ed, we're not going to give 2019 guidance today. But we are very excited about what's upcoming in 2019 and 2020, based on the response we've seen, the store remodels, next year, you can expect us to remodel similar number of stores. We'll continue to open up highly productive small-format stores.","Mark and the team have some exciting new owned brand introductions. We'll continue to scale and build awareness around our fulfillment portfolio, which makes Target the easiest place to shop in America.","So as we continue to build awareness around our fulfillment options, begin to scale more remodels, moving into new catchments with new small formats, the elevation of our brand portfolio, we're very excited about 2019 and beyond.","And as I've said many times now, we're still in the very early stages of this journey. And while we feel great about the progress we've made in 2018, we're certainly ahead of schedule. We're certainly driving very strong traffic in market share gains. The bulk of the work is still in front of us. So that's why we're so confident about the path that we're on and excited about 2019 and 2020 and beyond.","Catherine Smith","Ed, as I think about it, the third quarter was an important leg in this relay race that we're on because of the operational progress we made throughout the course of the business. But now we're to the point where we have our full suite of fulfillment options that we can now really start delighting our guest but really aligning that mission to closest to the store for the high-frequency things will that makes it easier for them to pull in to our parking lot and tick up their diapers or their dinner to go whatever it is.","Now with that full suite of fulfillment options, with delight our guest, first and foremost, but secondly, is we'll start to move those missions closer to the store on those times when it matters, especially those higher-frequency lower margin categories.","Edward Kelly","Excellent. Thank you.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Robbie Ohmes with BofA Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead.","Robert Ohmes","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Cathy, I wanted to just follow-up on the gross margin fee. I think the expectation was that they\u2019d be up in the back half, and I think you guys have said stronger in the 4Q than 3Q. As we look at the fourth quarter, in the gross margin being down less than it was in the third quarter, maybe a little bit more color on what the \u2013 maybe the fourth quarter digital growth assumption is? And sort of what changes \u2013 is it basically that the pressure from bringing all the inventory into the third quarter alleviates in the fourth quarter? Maybe a little bit more color there would be helpful?","Catherine Smith","Good morning, Robbie. To your point, we knew that we have a lot of cost of goods sold initiative that'll start to come through back half of this year, which are exactly doing what we said. The strength of digital at 46% this quarter, on top of last year's in the 24 range is a pretty big change. So that is some of the pressure you're seeing in Q3. When we move into Q4, we did a 29 digital comp last year in the fourth quarter, and so we're anticipating still strong fourth quarter digital comp as you'd expect.","Now we can offer the full suite of fulfillment options we think ask to going to choose some of those that are a little bit more convenient, they can come by our stores and the economics are better. So that's one, but -- so one is we'll see the year-over-year digital growth quite as big change that we're expecting in the fourth quarter.","But more importantly, we still see those much initiatives and we are starting to see some of those cost of goods sold coming through there in the fourth quarter. So those are the exchanges. And lastly, the amount of inventory will move in Q3. Obviously, we're here and ready for the holidays, come shop and shop often in Target, so we're going to have a really good fourth quarter in holiday.","Robert Ohmes","And did China tariff play any role in - bringing in more inventory in the third quarter? And maybe you can update us on how you're thinking about tariffs for the fourth quarter and for next year?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Let me start Robbie. We clearly were planning well ahead for a very strong fourth quarter. We wanted to make sure we had the inventory in our system to meet the very strong demand we're anticipating for the fourth quarter. And there's really no update on the overall tariff front. We continue to watch it each and every day, as I know you do. And we're looking at what levers we can pull to make sure we minimize the impact for our guest. So we'll watch it very carefully. Obviously, it's a very fluid topic right now. But our focus is on executing the fourth quarter. And we got the inventory and the plans in place to make sure this is a very strong fourth quarter for Target.","Robert Ohmes","Great. Best of luck for the holiday season.","Brian Cornell","Thank you. We appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Schick with Consumer Edge Research. You may go ahead.","David Schick","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, a couple of times in your initial discussion and then even in Q&A, you're talking about the very early stages of these investments that the consumer is enjoying with choices, with merchandising, delivery choices, et cetera.","But I guess, if you look at the history of retail, oftentimes this high level of investments is made when there's a weaker major players that you can sort of finish off and enjoy a better margin over a longer period of time. How do you think about that long-term aspect of the spending curve given the capabilities and the competition between major players, including yourself?","Brian Cornell","Well, in some ways, you've answered the question for me. We certainly have been talking for several years now about the opportunities that are in the market as many of our competitors shrink or liquidate and go out of business. And we think there's sizable market share opportunities as we continue to see the rationalization of the retail landscape. But the investments we're making are still in the very early stages. Well, it feels like we've been talking for years about remodeling stores.","The fact of the matter is, over the last couple of years, we've remodeled just over 400 stores. We've got many, many more stores that we're going to touch over the next couple of years. We're excited about small formats, but we've got a portfolio of new catchments that will be entering over the next couple of years. The work on owned brand has been very well-received by the guest, but those brands are only going to build greater awareness over the next few years.","And importantly, from a fulfillment standpoint, while we've been carefully testing and building platforms and capabilities, it's really just now that we're starting to extend these fulfillment options at scale. So that's going to build over the next couple of years. So as we go into 2019 and 2020, we'll have remodeled even more stores. And we know as we remodel stores, we see a very positive lift. So stores are driving additional footsteps each and every week. It's helping us capture market share in those neighborhoods.","Our small format stores are incredibly productive right now and are being incredibly well received by the guest. So when we combine the work that we're doing in-store with the progress we're making from a fulfillment standpoint to meet the needs of the guest, no matter how they want to shop and make sure that our stores were at the center of that component, we believe there's opportunities for further market share gains that continue to drive very strong traffic and comp store sales. And the scale of these initiatives, which over time will reduce our cost and continue to make Target the easiest place to shop in America.","So we're in the very early stages. And we\u2019ll be at a higher level of scale in 2019 and build off of that. But if this was a football game, since we're in the season, we're still in the first quarter, but I like the point that we're putting on the board.","David Schick","Well, thanks very much. I guess to continue that. Good luck in the all important drive starting\u2026","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Catherine Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may go ahead.","Edward Yruma","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I know that on the second quarter call, you talked about being light on inventory, obviously ended in a different inventory position in the third quarter. Were you short of inventory intraquarter in the third quarter? And do you think that impacted sales? And then second, you talked a lot about, how some of these urban stores are helping reach a new consumer? Can you give us some color on the profitability or the trends you're seeing on some these locations? Thank you.","Catherine Smith","Maybe I'll start, if it's okay, Ed, with the new \u2013 the small formats, and then John maybe can add into the inventory question. So on small formats, yes, first off, we really like that we're able to access guest that haven't had access to Target in the past. And so that has been terrific. We continue to like what we're seeing out of the small stores, they have great sales productivity as we referenced in the call earlier. And we do see really good returns. So we measure them against the same IRRs, and the same hurdle rates we do all of our investment, and they have really good returns. So we'll continue to see that. You'll see us continue to open new and small formats.","John Mulligan","On inventory, we have felt good about inventory really the whole year long about where we've been on inventory. There's been some businesses we've chased into. Like Toys, we have aggressively chased into. And Baby, which have the result of what's going on in the marketplace there. But I wouldn't describe our inventory ever as light. I think we were well positioned at the end of the second quarter. We feel really good about our position right now. We knew we would peak inventories relatively early given when Black Friday falls this year. And of course, you saw that on our third quarter balance sheet. But overall, we feel really good about where we've been positioned on inventory throughout the year.","Brian Cornell","And if we go back to the new small format, I think it's important to point out, this is allowing us to reach a guest that in the past we hadn\u2019t been able to serve. So when you think about the recent quarter and approximately 60 bps of revenue contributed by these new small formats, that's largely incremental. These are neighborhoods and catchments where we haven't been participating before. It's a guest that wasn't able to shop with Target on a regular basis. So not only are they already contributing to our revenue, it's opening up a door for our new guest to shop at Target. And the reaction, as Cathy has referenced, has been very positive. We're seeing incredible productivity out of these stores, and we are reaching a guest in neighborhoods where we've never completed before.","Edward Yruma","Great. Thanks so much.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird. You may go ahead.","Peter Benedict","All right, thanks guys. Just to circle back quickly on the gross margin. The fulfillment cost pressures, I guess, from Digital in the third quarter, is it safe to assume that they were a little more than what you saw sequential in the third quarter, which I think third quarter was around 60 basis points. Is it fair to assume it was more than that?","Catherine Smith","Peter, you must be talking about second quarter. So we did see \u2013 I'm not sure. So let me just address the third quarter gross margin. As we said, it was obviously lower than we had anticipated or the deterioration was. Really, the biggest piece of that is the supply chain costs related to the digital fulfillment to support that 49% comp. The next biggest piece of it is really around the supply chain cost to process, receive and process the inventory ahead of the holiday. And so I'm not sure if that's helping where you're going.","Brian Cornell","I might add. We've circled around this a couple of times. We did move a lot of inventory in second quarter, and we did it at a higher cost. Do you guys all know there's transportation pressure out there? Our first and foremost objective is it relate to transportation was ensuring that we secure the supply we would need to move our goods. And so we did that. And we will find ways to offset that incremental cost through other ways as we go forward. But we're moving a lot of inventory, and it was at a higher rate than we paid last year. So both of those factors applied to what Cathy is talking about.","Peter Benedict","That\u2019s helpful. And I guess, as we look to the fourth quarter again, I'm sorry to stick with the gross margin, I guess the expectation in the fourth quarter in gross margin, is it safe to say similar to what you saw in the first half of the year? I think it was down around 20 basis points range. I mean, is that the level or the magnitude of improving you\u2019re expecting in the fourth quarter?","Catherine Smith","Yes. I don't think we'd go specifically what we're expecting for the fourth quarter. What we said is we'll see some continued pressure, but it won't be near the extent we see in the third quarter.","Peter Benedict","Okay. That\u2019s fair. Just last question, Cathy, just in terms of the tax rate, I know it's dynamic, but maybe what your range of assumptions are for the fourth quarter in terms of tax rate?","Catherine Smith","Yes. So I would think more of a normalized \u2013 think about a new statutory rate with the Federal tax reform is probably a better place. So if you just take the third quarter, we obviously on print was 13.6% tax rate, which is incredible. I'll stop there. But if you take out the adjustment we made to the previous deferred, we would have been closer to a 19-ish range or so. And so if you start thinking about kind of maybe a normal, that's a better way to think about it.","Peter Benedict","Great.","Brian Cornell","With that operator, we've got time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.","Gregory Melich","I'd like to talk about two things, basically the loyalty programs, particularly Shipt, any color there in terms of how much of the digital growth that's driving or how many members up to now? I think you mentioned the number of markets. And also, REDcard, it just seems like the penetration there has been sort of stable. Is there anything that you're considering to maybe reinvigorate that? Tell us some of the tests are going on REDcard? That would be really helpful.","Catherine Smith","Yes. So Greg, maybe I\u2019ll start and then Brian and John can pile on too. For REDcard, as you said, penetration is about stable. As we said in the past, we know that, that is a great program. They're our highest, most engaged guest, our most loyal guests.","So we actually want to continue to growth that. You're seeing us more exclusive. You'll see it this year with the fourth quarter like we did last year and really make those a special relationship with our guest. However, we also know that, that doesn't speak to everyone.","And so as you know, we've been testing a loyalty program in Dallas, we call it Target Red, which is a non-tender-based program to really have everyone be a part of the relationship with Target. So we're excited about where that's going. We'll continue to test that this next year. But all of the indications are very, very positive. We're seeing really good sign-up and engagement with RED program.","Brian Cornell","John, do you want to wrap this up with update on Shipt?","John Mulligan","Yes. With Shipt, we remain really excited \u2013 really proud of how the team has scaled that throughout this year. We're in over 250 markets now in a very short amount of time. We continue to see very strong response from consumers. I think the metric I look at gets me most excited, if you look at mature markets, markets that have been open for over a year still continue to see triple-digit growth in sales, in GMV. So guests continue to engage more and more even in markets where we've been there a long time.","The other thing I would add Greg, to get to your question is the impact on digital growth is relatively modest because we are not reporting GMV. We're only reporting our revenue, which, of course, is quite modest relative to the GMCs \u2013 GMV sales that go through Shipt. So the impact there is relatively modest, but we're very excited with Shipt the opportunity now is to begin testing Shipt deliveries on target.com and the opportunity to scale that next year.","Gregory Melich","If I could, I love to follow-up on that, just given the strength in traffic. Have you guys been thinking about ways to monetize that traffic with digital advertising, in particular just given what the trying to move in that direction Amazon certainly over the $7 billion of advertising revenue. How are you guys thinking about using all that data and traffic maybe outside the traditional avenues?","Brian Cornell","It's something we're thinking about each and every day, and it probably leads us to wrap today and invite all of you to join us in the spring for our updated Financial Community Day. So it's something that we\u2019re very focused on, continue to build loyalty with our guest.","End of Q&A","Brian Cornell","But for today, I think, operator, we're going to wrap up our third quarter call and invite every one to join us again in the spring, so thank you."],"20449":["Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call August 22, 2018  8:00 AM ET","Executives","John Hulbert - VP, Investor Relations","Brian Cornell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","John Mulligan - EVP and Chief Operating Officer","Mark Tritton - EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer","Cathy Smith - EVP and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Seth Sigman - Credit Suisse","Mike Lasser - UBS","Oliver Chen - Cowen","Chris Horvers - JP Morgan","Matt McClintock - Barclays","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.

This increase was driven by traffic growth of more than 6% an unprecedented number and by far the strongest performance, since we began reporting this metric in 2008.","Total sales were up 7% from a year ago, reflecting 0.5 point of growth from our new and non-mature stores. Store comparable sales increased nearly 5%, and digital sales grew more than 40% in the second quarter as guests continued to respond to a growing menu of convenient fulfillment options, newness around our merchandising categories, freshly remodeled stores and a higher level of service across the chain.","On top of the strong digital sales trend, we've been seeing for many years, we saw a meaningful incremental lift from our one-day sale in July, which came in far ahead of expectations. With very strong traffic both in-store and online, we saw accelerating comp sales trends in all five of our core merchandising categories. While there are healthy increases across the board, comp growth in our Home category was amazingly strong, up nearly 10%. Hardlines also saw high-single digit comp growth driven by strength in both toys and electronics.","And with stronger than expected sales, our business delivered stronger than expected profitability. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.47 was near to the high-end of the guidance range of $1.30 to $1.50. This represents about 20% growth compared with the year ago, despite the fact that our results continue to reflect significant investments in both capital and operating income to position Target for long-term success. These investments include our plan to perform wall-to-wall remodels of approximately 1,000 stores over a 3-year period. Our work to complete the transform, Target supply chain, placing our stores at the center of a modern network design to deliver an unmatched combination of convenient fulfillment options; opening new small format stores across the country allowing us to reach guests we couldn't serve with our larger formats; last year's investments to ensure we're priced right daily in support of the Pay Less side of our brand promise; our work to deliver a constant drum beat of new and exciting merchandize throughout our owned and exclusive brand portfolio; the rollout of new convenient digital capabilities that make it easier and more inspiring for guests to shop, save and use their REDcard, and most importantly investments in hours, wages and training for our team members. These investments enable our team to deliver higher levels of service and productivity and our guests are responding to the change. We embarked on this investment plan at the beginning of 2017 and our progress so far has been well ahead of our original expectations.","There is no doubt that like others, we're currently benefitting from a very strong consumer environment, perhaps the strongest I've seen in my career. But market share data demonstrates that our current results are benefitting from more than just the environment, as we're seeing broad market share gains across categories we sell. The question we continue to hear from many of you is whether we can separately measure the benefit of each of these investments we're making. And the honest answer is we can't evaluate each one of them in isolation. Instead, it's the collective benefit of all of these initiatives that is keeping Target more top of mind with guests, enticing them to visit our stores and our site more often.","Before I turn to our outlook for the rest of the year and beyond, let me comment briefly on the topic of tariffs. Like many of you, we've been carefully monitoring recent tariff announcements. And we are aware of the potential for the situation to further escalate. As we said many times, as a guest-focused retailer, we're concerned about tariffs because they would increase prices on everyday products for American families. In addition, a prolonged deterioration in global trade relationships could damage economic growth and vitality in the United States. Given these risks, we have been expressing our concerns to our leaders in Washington, both on our own and along with other retailers and trade association partners. However, our concern is centered on the impact of tariffs, on consumers and the economy, not our ability to manage our business in the face of these challenges.","As you know, when we\u2019re faced with tariffs or any other external factors, there are multiple levers we can pull to remain price competitive and maintain profitability, and we are continually developing and implementing contingency plans as we learn more and things evolve. While we always account for risks like these when we plan for the future, today, we are also focused on the multiple opportunities we see in front of us.","In the first half of 2018, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.8%, a result which is much stronger than the expectation at the beginning of the year. As a result, we have updated our comp guidance, and we are now planning for comp growth in the back half of the year in line with what we\u2019ve seen in the front half. In addition, we have also updated our full year EPS expectations. Cathy will provide more details in a few minutes. These upgrades to our outlook reflect the current trends we\u2019re seeing across our business, including a very strong start to back-to-school and back-to-college. In addition, we continue to focus on unique opportunities in key Toy and Baby categories, given the recent closure of Toys \"R\" Us and Babies \"R\" Us across the country. And of course, as the year progresses, we\u2019ll continue to benefit from the broader rollout of new fulfillment capabilities like Drive-Up and Shipt, brand launches in multiple categories, the completion of additional remodels and the opening of more small-format stores.","As we look beyond 2018, we have increasing confidence that we can deliver very strong results in the years ahead, as we move into the next phase of our strategic plan and achieve scale across the full slate of our growth initiatives. When we move beyond testing to scaling, we'll see efficiencies and cost savings further strengthening our guest experience and overall position in the marketplace, and importantly by the end of 2020, we\u2019ll have a newly refreshed base of stores, reflecting our plan to complete more than 1,100 remodels in a 4-year period through 2020.","So now, before I turn the call over to John, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for everything they are doing to deliver outstanding operational and financial performance.","In pursuit of our plans, we\u2019re asking our team to deliver more change, faster than at any time ever before. The team is responding enthusiastically to the challenge and it is inspiring to see our vision coming to life. But I want to quickly add, while our progress feels great, we have no intention of slowing down. We\u2019ll continue to seize the opportunity ahead of us, and offer our guests more inspiration and convenience than ever before.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John, who'll provide an update on our rollout of new fulfillment options, investments to new and existing stores, and changes in our stores to make the shopping experience easier for our guests. John?","John Mulligan","Thanks, Brian, and good morning everybody. As I have discussed with many of you, the operations team faces a fundamental challenge in delivering on our strategic initiatives as we work to make changes to virtually every facet of our operations, modernizing our supply chain, delivering new fulfillment options and increasing efficiency in our stores. We need to simultaneously focus on maintaining everyday reliability in support of a $75 billion business.","In the phase of this challenge, I'm really proud of how our team is performing on both priorities, particularly in light of the rapid acceleration in sales we've seen in recent quarters.","As you know, our strategic plan includes significant investments in the physical infrastructure of our stores. This is because our stores will continue to be the key fulfillment note for our guests whether that's a traditional store trip, a drive-up order, an in-store pickup order, a trip by a ship shopper or a traditional e-commerce purchase ship from a local Target store.","Our goal for the year to deliver well over 300 remodels and we are on track to deliver that plan. We completed remodels of 113 stores in the second quarter on top of the 56 we completed in the first quarter and many more are underway. In fact, in July, we had 258 locations undergoing a remodel during at least the portion of the month, the highest at any kind in our history. While our remodel project creates an optimal platform for all of our fulfillment initiatives, it also provides our guests with the more inspiring environment that's easier to shop. And our guests continue to respond by shopping more often, specifically consistent with our plan. We continue to see traffic driven incremental sales lift of 2% to 4% in our remodel stores following completion of the remodel. And while the data is limited, we are seeing some early indications that remodel stores continue to help comp other stores beyond the first year after the remodel.","We also continue to see encouraging performance from our new small format stores. We opened six of these new locations in the second quarter, on top of the six we opened earlier in the year. These locations delivered high sales productivity along with gross margin rates above the company average. And we continue to see strong growth as these stores mature. At the end of the quarter, we were operating 26 mature small format stores, and on average this group saw high single-digit comp growth during the quarter.","Beyond the physical experience in our stores, we continue to invest in hours, training and wages for our store team allowing them to deliver a higher level of service and a better overall experience for our guests. While this modernization is focused on the guest experience, it is fueled by efficiency. In the second and third quarters this year, we investing in team member training across every one of our stores, focusing on how our team members can be more helpful to our guests as they shop.","We've rolled out new tools and technology that allow our team to find and order items on behalf of our guests and process the sale from anywhere in the sales floor. We're hiring differently, focusing on the passion and expertise of the team members who can deliver more information in service in key categories like Beauty, Electronics, Apparel and Food. And in Food and Beverage, we are changing how the team accomplishes everyday task allowing more opportunities for guest to interact with experts on the sales floor, while also standardizing operations to ensure we have fresh and full presentations, a focus on food safety and a strong and efficient foundation for how we operate. While these investments are already helping us to deliver stronger traffic in sales, we are also focused on driving efficiencies that can help us offset the cost. As a result, we have completely redesigned when and how our team sort in stock product reducing steps and creating more opportunity for guest interaction during key business hours.","In addition, we have implemented changes to our backroom organizations for store teams to more efficiently ensure our guests have what they need on the sales floor, particularly in apparel. And of course, our work on the upstream supply chain is focused on changes that will dramatically reduce store workload associated with unloading and restocking over the next two years.","Beyond the store investments, I want to give you an update on our rollout of new fulfillment options across the country. The team has been moving at an amazing pace and our guests continue to tell us that they love the new options.","I'll start with Shipt, our same day personal shopping service, which is now operating in more than 160 markets and serving more than 1,100 Target stores. Over the last year, Shipt's membership base of more than tripled while orders, revenue and GMB are two to three times higher. While some of this growth is being driven by Shipt's entry into new markets, we\u2019re seeing orders in GMB in comparable markets meaning markets in which Shipt was already operating a year ago that are up nearly 100% year-over-year.","We\u2019re also very pleased that new partners continue to sign into the Shipt platform attracted by the reliability and level of service that Shipt can provide. Year-to-date Shipt team has added to their marketplace a total of 19 new retail partners, who operate under 24 unique banners across the country. This is more than double the number of new partners that Shipt added to its marketplace in all of 2017.","We\u2019re also pleased with the rollout of our new service in dense urban market stores, which we call delivery from store. With this service, guests pay a small fee at checkout and choose a time window later at same day, when their shopping basket will be delivered to their front door. This service is now available in 58 stores across five markets and guests continue to love it. The average basket size for this service is more than $200, the highest of any service we provide.","And last, but certainly not least, is our new Drive-Up service. We started the year offering Drive-Up in 50 stores, and at the end of the second quarter, it expanded to more than 800 locations around the country. Our stores have done an excellent job training their teams to deliver this new service and guest satisfaction is off the charts.","Our most recent Net Promoter Score for Drive-Up is 88, a crazy high number, the highest of any service we provide. We expect to have this service rolled out to nearly 1,000 stores by the holiday season, and we will continue the rapid expansion next year.","On top of these new services, we continue to see rapid growth and adoption of other digital fulfillment services, including restock, in-store pickup and, of course, shipping to our guest front doors. And you have seen that growth in our numbers for a long time now, as we've seen year-over-year growth in our digital sales in the 20% to 30% range for several years. However this quarter we saw a step-up in the pace of growth, and a lot of that acceleration was driven by a one-day sale in July. Among the many reasons to host a digital sale in July, it's important for our team, because it gives them the opportunity to stress test our systems and processes in advance of the peak holiday season.","And this year, the July sale presented a really robust test as orders in sales far exceeded our expectations. The sale created by far the biggest digital sales day we have ever experienced outside of a holiday season, driving volume nearly three times higher than our forecast. While this was great news, of course, our store and supply chain teams had to react and recover quickly to fulfill all the unplanned demand and keep operations running smoothly. While that challenge presented some long days for our team, I am really proud of how they responded adding to my confidence and our ability to accommodate peak demand in the upcoming holiday season.","In a way, the story of the one-day sale is similar to the story of the second quarter as we saw stronger than expected volume throughout the quarter. This has caused some in-stock challenges in certain items and categories, and the team is working quickly to recover and plan for higher volumes throughout the rest of the year. As a result, our inventory position at the end of the second quarter was up about 11% from a year ago.","Of course, a meaningful portion of this growth is being driven by our current and planned level of sales, which are growing faster than we\u2019ve seen in many years. In addition, the team has brought an extra inventory to recover and protect in-stocks. And we are seeing higher levels of in-transit inventory, as our operations teams develop plans to accommodate the fourth quarter surge. And of course, our merchant teams have brought an extra volume to address the unique market share opportunities we\u2019re facing in Toys and Baby. Bottom-line, we continue to feel very good about our overall inventory position given our plans for the rest of the year.","Before I turn it over to Mark, I want to reiterate what Brian said earlier. Our current traffic and sales growths are not being driven by any single thing we're doing. They're the result of everything we're doing for our guests. And I want to thank everyone on the team for making it happen where there is a lot of change that's visible from the outside, there is even more change happening internally. That amount of change presents a challenge. So it's incredibly rewarding when we see our guest responding such a positive way.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark, who'll provide more detail on our second quarter performance and our upcoming plans in merchandising. Mark?","Mark Tritton","Thanks, John. As Brian and John have mentioned, the momentum we're seeing across our business is amazing and we can't point to any one single driver. Instead, the common denominator is our guest, who is speaking of us and choosing to shop with us more often. As we benefit from this momentum, our goal is to maintain this focus on our guests and push ourselves to do more, even more quickly and service to them.","As we've said before at Target, we're at our best when we maintain a proper balance in our business with a focus on delivering and not or. After all, we don't ask our guest to expect more or pay less, we work to consistently deliver on both sides of that brave promise. But it doesn't stop there. We feature a curated assortment that satisfies wants and needs of these basic items and must-have style and highlights national brands and owned brands.","We invest to ensure we're price right daily and offering compelling deals, design our assortment to support both stock up and filling trips and we feature all of that in-store and online. Guest serve base give us confidence that we're achieving a proper balance in the current environment. For example, in the second quarter, our guest scores for convenience in everyday pricing increased, and our differentiation score increased as well. This is a testament of the efforts of our entire team over the last 18 months, and their focus on delivering the right combination of everyday prices and compelling promotions with the right assortment of innovative national brands alongside exciting new owned and exclusive brands. We're also seeing good balance in our category performance. Comp growth in all five of our core categories accelerated in the second quarter, and all of them grew faster than our first quarter comp of 3%. Among the three months, May benefited from the recovery of temperature-sensitive sale, and July benefited from the back-to-school, back-to-college and some calendar shift, but comps in all three months was stronger than our first quarter trend.","Also of note, we saw some of our strongest market share gains around key life moments like Mother's Day, Father's Day, Memorial Day and, of course, the July 4. But we also saw sustained results outside of those holidays, driven by the strength of our essentials in Food and Beverage categories, which saw share gains in every week of the quarter. We saw unusually strong second quarter growth across each of our style categories, Apparel, Beauty and Home. However Home was the standout with the comp of nearly 10% growth, driven by even faster growth in d\u00e9cor and kitchen, which are benefitting from our new owned brands.","Within Home, we also saw strong sales in seasonal categories, reflecting encouraging early results in the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons. In Apparel, we saw high-teens growth in Baby, reflecting the benefit of the unique opportunity we're facing to gain market share in Baby and Toys, given the recent closures of Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us across the country.","Given the strong affinity between families to young children and our brand, but Toys and Babies are category for us and we expect to see traffic and share gains in both of them for the rest of the year and beyond. Outside of the style categories, our Hardlines, Food and Beverage and Essentials categories also delivered standout growth. Hardlines was particularly strong, driven by double-digit comps in both Toys and Electronics. Now within Electronics, we saw really strong growth in video games as well as accessories, where we successfully launched our new own brand Heyday, during the quarter.","In Essentials, second quarter growth was strongest in Baby and in Pets, both of which saw double-digit comp growth. In Food and Beverage, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of accelerating comps. Growth continues to be led by adult beverage in produce areas in which we have made important investments over the last couple of years.","To continue supporting our frequency businesses, our successful Target Run and Done marketing campaign has begun featuring convenient fulfillment services like in-store pickup and Drive-Up, making sure our guests understand all the ways they can get their Target run done. As we look at broad category strength, what's especially encouraging is that it isn't being driven by higher promotions. In fact, sales of our everyday price are uphold in $2 billion so far this year, reflecting the continued benefit of our team's efforts to establish a better balance between meaningful promotions in everyday pricing.","Even for the promotional events like our July one-day sale, we\u2019re thinking differently about how we can provide value. More than half of our digital sales on that day were in a highly differentiated and high-margin Home category. And as John told you, we blew away our forecast for that event.","As we look ahead, we have a lot more in store, for the third quarter and beyond. On top of the new owned and exclusive brands, we launched in 2017, and earlier this year, which continue to perform really well. We launched four new own brands in the second quarter that will drive our results going forward. Three of these new brands were designed to invite young millennials in the emerging Gen Z guests to experience Target in ways that are authentic to them.","Wild Fable is our newest apparel and accessories brand for young women. It's driven by current trends and focused on enabling just to create their own style, for their own many life moments. For young men, we just launched Original Use, a street meets vintage modern brand focused on enabling guests to explore fashion, culture and individuality. Both Wild Fable and Original Use feature a wide range of sizes reflecting our commitment to inclusive sizing.","As I mentioned earlier, we launched our exclusive Heyday brand of electronic accessories in June. This brand is designed to appeal to style conscious guests an incredible value without sacrificing quality with trendy, fun and quality tech at very affordable prices. Also, in June, we've launched our newest home brand, made by design consisting more than 750 items in kitchen storage, bedding, bath and even furniture with most items below $30. This brand is the ultimate expression of Target DNA, a commitment to the democratization of design, offering high quality style at affordable prices. We design each product to intuitively go beyond the expected delivering smart solutions that make everyday tasks easier. For example, the cookware incorporates pour spouts on the rims and built in strainers in the lids, glasses are stackable and towels include hang hooks that keeps them of the floor and items were designed to forgive minor mistakes like silicon and nylon tools that can handle heat up to 450 degrees in case you\u2019re accidentally leave your spatula on a hot fry pan.","And finally, in addition to our new own brand, we are really pleased with the second quarter performance of our unique collaboration with Disney to celebrate Mickey's 90th anniversary. This collaboration features more than 350 exclusive items, spanning multiple categories including toys, bedding, beach gear, beauty, even pets, all celebrating Mickey and the pure magic of summer, bringing joy you can only find at Target. Of course, beyond new items and brands already launched, we have more newness plans for the third quarter and look forward to revealing more soon.","But our differentiation doesn't just happen with new brands. We also delivered newness through our existing brand portfolio. Look at Cat and Jack, we launched this kids brand more than two years ago and sales and market share continue to grow. That's because we continuing to invest and deliver newness and great designs through Cat and Jack every day, every season. Whether we're talking about our new brand or an existing brand, it's our focus on the guest, innovation and great design at a great price that are keys for Target to continue to win through differentiation. And that is not going to slow down.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cathy, who'll provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year. Cathy?","Cathy Smith","Thanks Mark. Our second quarter financial performance exceeded our expectations on both the top-line and the bottom line reflecting the benefit of our strategic initiatives in a very strong consumer environment. As Brian mentioned, our second quarter comp sales increase of 6.5%, is the strongest we've seen at Target in 13 years. This growth reflected a 4.9% increase in our store comparable sales combined with 41% growth in digital. These are both very healthy numbers in isolation, and they're even more powerful together.","Traffic growth of 6.4% accounted for nearly all of our comparable sales growth in the second quarter. In addition, for the first time in nearly two years, our comp sales grew faster than comp traffic as we saw a small, 0.1% increase in basket in the quarter. In our last quarterly call, when describing our first quarter traffic increase of 3.7%, we described it as the strongest result we had ever reported since we began reporting this metric in 2008. Obviously then, this quarter's traffic growth of more than 6% is well beyond anything we've reported before, and we are really encouraged to see continued momentum in such a key metric.","Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.3% was down about 10 basis points from last year and slightly better than our guidance. Among the drivers, we continue to see meaningful pressure from fulfillment costs as guests engagement with our digital channel continues to grow, and we've rapidly roll out new convenient fulfillment options across the country. However, in the second quarter, this headwind was almost completely offset by the benefit of our merchandising initiatives, including ongoing cost saving efforts and the benefit of our work on pricing and promotions. The mix of our sales was a slight headwind in the second quarter as strong sales in our high-margin Home and Apparel categories were balanced by really strong trends in lower margin categories, including Toys, Baby and Electronics.","Our second quarter SG&A expense rate was about 10 basis points higher than last year. Across the broad categories of expense, there were no large rate variances year-over-year, as cost pressures were offset within categories. For example, second quarter compensation costs reflected pressure from higher wage rates, but those costs were offset by lower incentive expense compared with the year ago.","Our second quarter depreciation and amortization expense rate was slightly lower than a year ago. This was better than our expectations, driven by stronger than expected sales and a smaller than expected increase in DNA expense associated with our remodel program. Altogether, our operating income margin rate was about 20 basis points lower than last year, somewhat better than our guidance for a 40-basis-point decline. Notably operating income dollars were 3.6% higher than last year as the increase in total revenue more than offset a slightly lower rate.","Below the operating income line, second quarter interest expense was about 12% lower than a year ago, as we continue to benefit from last year's debt, retirement and refinancing activity. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21.8%, down nearly 10 percentage points from last year, reflecting the benefit of Federal Tax Reform Legislation. Bottom line, we've reported second quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $1.49, up 22.7% from last year and adjusted EPS of $1.47, 19.8% higher than a year ago.","Stepping back to look at the first two quarters of 2018 in total, Target's comparable sales have increased 4.8% from last year, and our GAAP and adjusted EPS are both up about 15%. This year-to-date performance reflects the traffic and sales benefit of our strategic initiatives, continued significant investments in operating income and the offsetting benefit from Federal Tax Reform.","Turning briefly to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with about $9.1 billion of inventory. This represents an 11% increase from last year, as John covered earlier. Also notable on the balance sheet is the growth in payables, which were 20% higher than last year, at about $9.1 billion as well. Payables leverage has grown substantially in the last couple of years, as the team has focused on improving that metric as a source of funding for the meaningful investments we're making.","Even accounting for this investment in our inventory, our business continues to generate very healthy cash flow. Specifically through the first half of 2018, our continuing operations have generated more than $2.7 billion in cash, providing ample capacity to make meaningful investments in our business, while returning capital to shareholders.","In the second quarter, we made capital investments of just over $1 billion, and we remain on track for CapEx of about $3.5 billion for the year. These investments are concentrated primarily in-store projects, including remodels, other presentation enhancements and new urban and college locations around the country.","Beyond those capital investments, in the second quarter, we returned just over $3.25 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And in June, our Board of Directors approved a 3.2% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.62 to $0.64. With this increase, 2018 is on track to mark our 47th consecutive year of annual increases.","Finally, I always like to close my quarterly commentary with a discussion of Target's after-tax ROIC. This is a key metric we monitor closely as it incorporates both our operating performance and the quality of our capital deployment decisions. For the trailing 12 months ending in the second quarter, we recorded after-tax ROIC of 16%, including the discreet benefits of Federal Tax Reform that we recorded in last year's fourth quarter. However, even after we exclude those discreet benefits, our second quarter ROIC of 14.2%, was up about 70 basis points from a year ago.","It's encouraging that we're returning to growth in this metric, as we're seeing the initial impact of last year's strategic investments in capital and operating income, which were designed to best position Target for success overtime.","So now, let's turn to our guidance for the third quarter and the full year. As we look at the underlying drivers of our traffic and sales, there are more positive indicators than we've seen for many years. These indicators are reinforced by our comparable traffic and sales results, which have been gaining momentum over the last year and half. As a result, today, we updated our guidance for both the third quarter and the back half of the year. And we are now planning for comparable sales growth in line with what we delivered in the first half of the year.","As we move down the P&L to the operating income line, we continue to plan cautiously and focused on the unique opportunity we are facing to capture additional traffic and market share in key categories like Toys and Baby. In light of that opportunity, we have updated our expectation for the gross margin mix of our sales for the remainder of the year, reflecting higher sales expectations in these lower margin categories. With this updated mix expectations, we are now planning for a gross margin rate decline of 30 to 40 basis points in the third quarter. Combining that expectation with our forecast for a slight increase in our SG&A expense rate and a small amount of rate favorability on the D&A expense lines, we are planning for a 20 to 30 basis points decline in our operating income margin rate in the third quarter. These expectations translate to an expected range for both GAAP and adjusted EPS of $1 to $1.20 in the third quarter.","For the full year, we are now planning for an operating income margin rate decline of 30 to 40 basis points on a higher base of expected sales. These expectations translate to a full year outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.50 compared with our prior range of $5.15 to $5.45. We believe this expectation achieves the appropriate balance between shorter-term and longer-term priorities. Mainly it reflects improved bottom line expectations resulting from an increase in expected sales, while allowing the flexibility for our business teams to invest appropriately in the traffic and the market share opportunities we're currently facing in a number of key categories.","As we enter next year, we will be well positioned to benefit from these share gains. In addition, we'll benefit from achieving much greater scale across all of the capabilities we've been testing and launching across the country. With this scale, we will realize efficiencies and cost savings, which will position us to deliver profitable growth in 2019 and beyond.","Before I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to thank all of you who are listening for staying with us on the journey we began last year. At the beginning of 2017, we said that to position Target for the long-term success, we needed to make some bold investments in both capital and operating margin to accelerate our transformation and deliver more relevant experiences brands, and fulfillment options to our guests faster. The momentum of our results since that announcement, 18 months ago, makes us more and more confident that we are making the right investments. And that affirmation is coming most strongly from our guests. We're seeing unprecedented traffic and the best comp sales trends in more than a decade.","As Brian said earlier, there is no doubt that the environment is an important factor in our current success as consumer trends are the strongest they've been in some time. But market share data continues to confirm that we are growing faster than the market in the broad set of categories we sell. While this is great to see, we are just entering the next phase of our transformation, and we have much more to accomplish in the months and years ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian for some final remarks.","Brian Cornell","Thanks, Cathy. Before we move to your questions, I want to add to what Cathy was just saying. 18 months ago, when we were developing our plan to make additional investments in our business, we could move faster, we considered all of our stakeholders, as we evaluated our options. Obviously, we started with our guests, since they are the center of everything we do, but we also decided to increase our investments in our Target team, adding hours, training and wages, to allow them to better serve our guests. We thought about our merchandise vendors and how we can change the way we work together to deliver quality, newness, differentiation and value to our guests.","We looked at our community giving and corporate responsibility efforts focusing on the issues most important to our guests, and where Target can have the most impact. And we obviously considered you, our shareholders, because your capital supports all of the investments we make.","So, as I mentioned at our financial community meeting last spring, I am very grateful for the personal comments I received from many of you, in support of the commitments we've made to our business, our team, our community, and creating long-term shareholder value. I hope you're as excited as we are to begin seeing the benefit of the long-term decisions we made last year, which are already driving a higher level of engagement between our guests and our brand.","With that, we'll move to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Seth Sigman","My question is about the guidance. So the guidance seems to imply, I guess, slightly better operating profit growth in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, it was up, and it was up for the first time in a very long time, which is nice to see, but it was down for the full first half on similar comps to what you're assuming for the second half. So could you just remind us of some of the drivers? And Cathy, we got the margin commentary, but could you just help us a little bit more with some of the levers as we move into the second half of the year, some of the cost savings and other opportunities that will help support that operating profit growth. Thank you.","Cathy Smith","As we did say, we're obviously, very, very pleased with the quarter, so thank you for the comment. And as we think about updating our guidance for the remainder of the year, we expect consistent sales. So first on the top line, we see the back half and we've got plans for consistent sales growth in that same range, which is, obviously, very strong consistent with the traffic and sales we've been seeing. And then on profitability, we see a great opportunity to continue to take share and go after some categories, specifically Toys and Baby. So we baked that in into the back half of the year. So all of that said, we'll continue investing in both the fulfillment aspects, which are coming through in gross margin and then the category mix. And then on the SG&A line, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our stores. All of that said, we expect the back half of the year for a slight deterioration in Op income margin rates.","Brian Cornell","Seth, we feel like we're very well positioned for the back half of the year, as I've mentioned with my prepared comments. We're seeing a very strong start to back-to-school and back-to-college. We continue to see very strong traffic trends, and we expect to monetize that in the back half of the year. So you should expect continued strong performance from Target throughout 2018, but it also sets us up for a very strong performance as we go into 2019 and beyond. So I think we're well positioned to continue to build off of the current momentum. And you should expect us to begin to grow operating income from a dollar standpoint.","Cathy Smith","And as you've mentioned, op income dollars did grow in the second quarter.","Seth Sigman","That's great color. If I could just follow-up, Brian, on your point, I mean clearly there is broad based strength here, and you've highlighted that you don't think it's any single initiative, but can you maybe speak to the biggest surprises relative to your expectations, because obviously the quarter turned out better than expected as well as the outlook. So just any more color on relative to your expectations what is outperforming? Thank you.","Brian Cornell","So I'll start with each one of our key initiatives is ahead of the schedule that we have set 18 months ago. We continue to see really positive responses from our store remodels. And John mentioned that in the month of July alone, we had over 250 stores under construction. In each and every market, we're seeing really strong guest response to those reimaged stores. Our new small formats continue to impress and are driving productivity from a sales standpoint that are beyond our expectations. The reaction that the guests have had to our new brands has been spectacular in Home, in Apparel, and now in Electronics. And each one of the fulfillment capabilities continues to deliver a great response from the guests. John talked about the Net Promoter Scores we're getting for a service like Drive-Up that will bring to scale for the holiday season. The reaction we're getting in each and every market to Shipt and the quality of Shipt shoppers that are servicing their members. In urban markets like New York or Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, DC, the ability to shop our urban small formats and then hours later have someone deliver that package to your doorstep for a $7 charge, very well received. And the investments that we've made in our store teams and putting more expertise in departments like Beauty and Apparel, in Food and Beverage, in technology, the reaction we're getting from our guests exceeded our expectations. So all of our key initiatives as they're working together as one are ahead of the schedule that we would have set 18 months ago. And now as we move into the holiday season, we'll have more of those at scale, and as we move into '19, we'll be further ahead of the original plan that we'd established back in February 2017. So each one of the key elements is working ahead of the schedule that we have set back in February 2017, and we expect that to continue to accelerate. And as you heard me say numerous times, the traffic number to me is the most important measure that our strategy is connecting with the consumer both in our stores and online. And we continue to see very strong traffic as we go into the third quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead.","Mike Lasser","You mentioned that the remodels were through that activity down in July. Was there actually a drag from the traffic, and same store sales results would have been better had it not been for some of the remodeling activity?","Brian Cornell","Yes. Mike, it's certainly disruptive when we're remodeling stores. And now we're doing it at scale. So we're very focused, John and his team on shortening the construction cycle, less disruption, rapid recovery. But you can only imagine with over 250 stores under construction during an important month like July, there was significant disruption in those store sales. We're going to see the recovery as we go into the third quarter and we certainly expect to have even better response in those stores in Q4. So when we remodel, there is significant disruption in sales, but we're seeing that return very quickly once we complete the remodel.","Mike Lasser","And is that also the case, I mean there was a shift with your same-store sales and it seems like based on your guidance, the shift has been really a meaningful story you're in what, either you saw in the third -- in the second quarter or what you expect for the next couple? And then I have one last follow up.","Brian Cornell","Yes, Mike, we're very pleased with the rollout. At this point, it's a very, very small impact to our overall sales. So we certainly expect over the next few years that Shipt will have a more meaningful impact on our overall performance. But at this point it's still in a very nascent stage.","Mike Lasser","I'm sorry, that was my fault. I meant like a calendar shift rather than \u2026","Brian Cornell","No.","Mike Lasser","I'm sorry, my fault. I should've spoke clearly.","Brian Cornell","We've seen no major impact to the calendar shift throughout the season.","Mike Lasser","Okay. And then the last question, the follow-up is, so it sounds like the gross margin's going to be impacted by the mix, which is a prudent strategy and totally reasonable for the back half. Is there also some effect from fulfillment costs as e-commerce becomes a bigger portion of the mix and this act as a continuous drag beyond just the next couple of quarters? Thanks.","Brian Cornell","We're certainly going to face some headwinds from the rapid growth that we've seen online, and our digital performance up 41% on comp of 32% last year. But I think, Mark and our entire team has done a sensational job of managing gross margin rate. You look at the kind of growth we drove in the second quarter up 6.5%, you look at digital growing by 41%. And we were able to basically maintain gross margin rates equal to last year. I mean the erosion was 10 basis points.","So with that kind of explosive growth, we're managing mixed very effectively. And it's weird and again you've heard us talk about this before, the continued performance of our own brand plays a very prominent role in allowing us to manage our mix, to have a category like Home grow at almost 10%, driven by some great new brand launches, led by made by design during the quarter. That's how we're managing to mitigate some of the gross margin rates deterioration that others are experiencing right now.","So I feel really good about the efforts of the team and our ability to continue to drive store growth at almost 5%, build our online business at a rate of 41%, but use our mixed management and our own brands to deliver very strong gross margin rate performance in the quarter.","Mike Lasser","Best of luck for the second half.","Brian Cornell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen. You may go ahead.","Oliver Chen","My question is about pricing and promotion. What are your thoughts on managing that in the context of what you've been doing in the consumer environment? You've done a really good job with that gross margin rate. And shifts about value and how you continue to communicate that. Also, we were curious about the loyalty program. You have a very loyal customer, but what's ahead in terms of what you're thinking there just to capture data and continue to engage \u2026","Brian Cornell","Oliver, why I don't start with loyalty, and then let Mark talk about our continued efforts to support our price rate daily positioning. The loyalty program is off to a very solid start in the Dallas market. We're watching that carefully. John Mulligan, are actually going to be heading down there this week to assess the program and our performance in the market still, in a very early stage. But as we think about 2019 and beyond, we've certainly expect our Target loyalty program, Target Red, to play a very important role in building even greater engagement and loyalty with our guests, so lot more to come as we get into 2019 and think about loyalty. But Mark, why don't you talk about our efforts on the pricing, and promo front and our continued support of being priced right daily.","Mark Tritton","I think that the work we did with priced right daily beginning in 2017 and our opening price point stands, which really spans how we're pricing every day both in national brand and owned brand, has been really key to part of the traffic generation, and seeing consistent flow of whether it's in stock-up or more importantly in fill-in trips that are changing our frequency business, but also across the board, make it very easy for the guest to shop in-store and online with great transparency and simplicity of pricing. So we've been able to exercise great pricing, communicate simply to the guests. And we're getting credit for that. And the data that we're seeing share in each of the categories is really reinforcing that.","Brian Cornell","Oliver, I think one of the reasons we feel confident in our second half outlook is because we're seeing such a great response from our guest to the investments we've made in pricing to make sure that we're priced right daily on those key food and beverage and household essential items. Those are driving footsteps to our stores, visits to our site, and they've been a key driver behind the rapid acceleration traffic.","Oliver Chen","Our last question is about the supply chain. You made a lot of -- really encouraging progress in supply chain. What are your thoughts about the state of speed and stock levels? And we saw a lot of the technology and thoughts you have ahead at your Investor Day, at Target Lab. What are you seeing in terms of how you'll manage the bricks and clicks story, and also how you'll manage for the smaller pack sizes? So love an update there. Thank you.","John Mulligan","Yes, Oliver, great question. I think, I've talked about this little bit in my remarks. The challenge for us is balancing, changing the business where we operate the business. And as you said, we showed you a lot of what we're doing to change the business. We'll start to scale-in a lot of that work in 2019. And that has the opportunity to significantly move our capabilities forward as we begin to scale that work. I think right now, we've said as the sales accelerated, particularly in Q2, Q1 to Q2, there are some areas where we've been spotting on in-stocks and we're not happy with that. And you see the response in our inventory, we've -- we're flowing goods in a little bit earlier for Q4, so that we can flow them to the stores appropriately. We've taken positions and things like A&A basics, things like denim, chinos, where last year, frankly the new brands came out, and we were almost immediately out of stock. We've made investments there. And then we're working hard on food and beverage. And as Mark said, we're gaining share for six quarters in a row. So we're learning to how to operate that business both differently in the store and in the supply chain. So we feel good about the progress we've made, but we are not satisfied with our current in-stock position. There is more work to do there.","Brian Cornell","And Oliver, I'll just build on that for you and others on the call. Well, this was a really strong quarter for the company. And when we think about comps at 6.5%, the strong comps in store, the acceleration in digital there is a lot to be proud of. But we know we've done a lot of work to do. And we've got to make sure that we're not meeting the demand that's taking place within our system. So John is very focused on that to make sure that we improve our in-stock position, but we've seen obviously a step function change in demand in our stores and online, accelerated growth. We're chasing some of that growth right now and we\u2019ve got to continue to make sure that we're doing a better job of replenishing our system as we go into the back half of the year, and particularly as we get ready for continued strong growth in 2019.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. You may go ahead.","Chris Horvers","Why don\u2019t you -- you focused a lot on scaling in terms of 2019's different initiatives, but also in terms of the investment base. At the Analyst day, earlier this year, you called out 2018 as an investment year and you're reiterating your view of profitable growth in 2019 and beyond. Can you frame that how you think of that in terms of the margin rates in the business, including gross margin and operating income rate? Could we see flat grosses in '19, and up OI rate? Or you're thinking about profitable growth in terms of a flow through on a flat OI rate?","Brian Cornell","Chris, this won\u2019t surprise you. We\u2019re not going to give 2019 guidance today.","Chris Horvers","I am trying.","Brian Cornell","I know you are, and you\u2019re trying hard. But I would refer you back to Cathy's comments earlier. When we look at our second quarter progress, really strong gross margin rate for a company that grew at our level. And for the first time in a while, operating income is growing from a dollar standpoint. So now we're seeing some improvement in our performance. We expect that to continue over time, but you'll have to stick with us for another day when we're ready to give 2019 guidance.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then in terms of the e-commerce growth, you call that a big lift from the one-day sale, but at the same time you're scaling a lot of fulfillment options into the back half. So do you think you can maintain sort of that 40% online sales growth into the back half and how much of that contributes to the updated comp outlook versus say, share in Baby and Toys in these key seasons coming up?","Brian Cornell","Chris, I'll let John to build on this. But we expect very strong digital growth in the back half. Obviously we're guiding to comp sales that are going to be very consistent with our first half performance. You're going to continue to see us scale up, Drive-Up and Shipt, same day delivery in urban markets. So that\u2019s going to play a very meaningful role. But you should expect our stores to be a very important driver to our growth in the back half of the year, and complemented by continued maturity in our fulfillment capabilities.","Cathy Smith","I'll just add real quickly, Chris. Stores did almost five comps by themselves, and obviously our stores are fulfilling much of that 41% digital growth. And so we're well over our two thirds of that digital growth is being fulfilled out of our store. And so we're blurring those lines every single day making sure we have a great experience to our guests and letting them choose to shop how they want to engage with Target. And so we're going to start talking less and less at some point about an actual digital comp because it is truly our entire business fueled by those stores.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. You may go ahead.","Matthew McClintock","Brian, I was wondering if I could ask a macro question. So the broader retail industry has truly enjoyed a resurgence across the board this quarter. Target seems to standout because of traffic, as you've highlighted. But I was wondering if I get your thoughts on what's driving this? Why does the consumer -- the American consumer all of a sudden just wake up and start going to retailers again? And then, thinking forward, how should we think about Target's strength this quarter and the traffic trend this quarter, the strength in everything in all throughout the year when we get to 2019, and you're up against that comparison in 2Q. Because I just want to say in 2Q of next year, there is going to be a lot of skepticism that you can comp the comp at that point in time? So just your thoughts.","Brian Cornell","So let me start with the macro environment. And we've talked about this a lot over the last few years, and there has been a lot of questions about the role of stores would play. And was everything going to shift online. And I think the one voice that was missing from that conversation was the voice of the consumer. And consumers continue to vote with their footsteps. And as we sit here today and the numbers tend to vary from week-to-week, but on any given day, 90% of retail sales were done in physical stores. And I think what you're seeing right now from a macro basis, is well-run retailers with strong balance sheets that generate cash that they can invest back into their business are winning right now. And there are, obviously, others right now that can't afford to invest in their store experience or build capabilities or drive differentiation. And they're giving us share. So there are clearly winners and losers. We certainly think we\u2019re migrating to the winners' column. And we're driving not only traffic, but as Mark and Cathy and John have talked about, we're taking market share in all of our major merchandising categories. And the investments we're making to make sure the target is a long-term winner are being rewarded right now by the consumer and our guest. So we've got to continue to make sure we focused on executing our strategies, we go into '19 continue to take advantage of the market share opportunities that are out there. And I'll go back to our February 2017 investor conference. And one of the things we've talked about in our overall management thesis if they're going to be billions of dollars of retail market share up progress, and we're going to position ourselves to take more than fair share of that. We're seeing it happen. As companies like Toys \"R\" Us and Babies \"R\" Us exit the market, as others close stores, we're picking up market share in those important categories in those key geographic attachments. And we'll expect to continue to do that in '19 and beyond. And as what gives us confidence that we're going to be able to last these strong numbers in 2018 with continued strength in '19 and beyond.","Matthew McClintock","Perfect. Thank you very much Brian.","Brian Cornell","Thank you. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. You may go ahead.","Joe Feldman","Why don't go back to something, I think, John was talking about with the labor and some of the changes maybe in the way you're hiring people and kind of the way you're allocating labor in the store and some of the transformation in the backroom. Can you just give a little more detail on that and speak for that issue?","John Mulligan","Sure, Joe. I think internally, you probably heard us talk about the store modernization, and it's really Ken and the store team have done a great job just stepping back and saying what is that we're trying to accomplish in the store. And certainly there is the work we have to do moving product out of the sales floor and checking people out and all the things that just happened because they have to have them in the store. And our goal there is to become more efficient. And to become more efficient not just for efficiency, let's say, but to provide the fuel, so that we can invest in more talent and better expertise on the sales floor, and in particular, in those areas where it matters the most. So, Beauty, Electronics with our visual merchandising in both Home and Apparel and then in Food, those are areas where we have gone out and actively hired for expertise. And that's where things like the wage investment are so critical. They've allowed us to differentiate in who and how we hire people. And so those team members finding ways to bring that expertise in and then keep them on the floor so that the Beauty team member is in beauty all the time. And they're able to help the guests, and they also keep track of what's going on in that part of the store relative to in-stocks and inventory flow.","And so rather than having a team of generalist doing price change one day, checking out the next day and maybe moving freight on Wednesday, these individuals are accountable for their part of the store, they're out there, they get to know the guests and provide a very different level of experience. And then we've invested in tools and a significant amount of training to help them. And this has been a journey we've been on for a couple of years. We will be on it for a couple more years as the team continues to evolve and build capabilities, but we think it's something incredibly important to our long-term success.","Brian Cornell","John, thank you. And operator, thank you. That concludes our Q2 earnings call. I appreciate everyone joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again when we talk about our Q3 results. So thank you."]}}
